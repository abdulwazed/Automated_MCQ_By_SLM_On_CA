      "Seeds of seabuckthorn and Himalayan tartary buckwheat grown in Ladakh’s cold desert are part of NASA’s Crew-11 experiment on the International Space Station (ISS). The seeds were sourced by Indian space start-up Protoplanet based in Bengaluru. The mission launched on August 1, 2025, from Florida and docked at ISS on August 2, 2025. The experiment aims to test how seeds react to space stress and microgravity before germination. It focuses on gene activation and metabolic processes vital for space agriculture.

      "A South African university launched a unique anti-poaching campaign by injecting radioactive isotopes into rhino horns. The initiative is called the Rhisotope Project and is led by the University of the Witwatersrand. It is supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Recently, five rhinos were injected with radioactive isotopes in the Waterberg Biosphere Reserve, South Africa. South Africa has lost more than 10,000 rhinos to poaching in the past decade, making the step urgently needed. Radioisotopes are unstable elements that emit radiation to become stable and can be traced. The isotopes are injected through a non-invasive method and are safe for rhinos.\n",

      "Russian forces have intensified their military campaign in Ukraines Donetsk region claiming the capture of Sredneye and KlebanByk. This advance brings Russian troops closer to Kostyantynivka a strategically important town on the route to Kramatorsk. Kramatorsk serves as a vital logistics hub for Ukrainian forces potentially disrupting supply lines if the advance continues. Representative Image AIgenerated  Russia on Saturday announced that its forces had captured two villages in Ukraines Donetsk region increasing military pressure as international efforts to end the conflict continue.Moscows defence ministry said on Telegram that its troops had taken control of Sredneye and KlebanByk. The capture of KlebanByk advances Russian forces closer to the town of Kostyantynivka  a key point on the route to Kramatorsk which serves as a major Ukrainian logistics hub.Russian forces are advancing slowly in the embattled eastern region grinding closer to Kyivs defensive line in costly metreformetre battles.On Friday Russia reported that its troops had captured three additional villages in the Donetsk region which it claims to have annexed in September 2022.The latest Russian advances come as hopes dim for a summit between Russian and Ukrainian presidents  a solution pushed by US President Donald Trump as part of his efforts to end the conflict.Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday said that no meeting is planned signaling a stall in Trumps mediation efforts. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has also accused Russia of attempting to prolong the offensive.Trump had also told reporters on Friday that he would make an important decision in two weeks regarding Ukraine peace efforts suggesting that Moscow could face massive sanctions  or he might do nothing.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

      "Berlins Mohrenstrasse a street with a racist name rooted in Germanys colonial past was slated to be renamed after Anton Wilhelm Amo the first Africanborn scholar to earn a European doctorate. Despite years of lobbying and legal battles residents initially blocked the change but the courts ultimately upheld the renaming. AP file photo  Decolonization does not happen by changing a few street names political scientist and human rights activist Joshua Kwesi Aikins told DW after it was announced on Friday that a central Berlin street will not have its racist name changed after all. The road had been slated to be renamed in honor of Anton Wilhelm Amo a Black German Enlightenment philosopher who in 1734 became the first Africaborn scholar to receive a European doctorate.That was in 2020. At the time the district council of BerlinMitte had approved the renaming but before it was implemented residents filed a lawsuit against it.But five years later in July this year the Higher Administrative Court of BerlinBrandenburg upheld a decision by the Berlin Administrative Court stating that residents have no basis to take legal action against the name change.Signs had already been installed and the change was to be officialized through a symbolic unveiling on Saturday August 23 which also marks International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition. Though the group Pro Mohrenstrae made a lastditch legal attempt to block the name change the BerlinBrandenburg court again upheld its ruling to allow for the name change.Dividing up Africa from BerlinSeveral civil society groups have lobbied for decades to change the name of Mohren or Moor Street respectfully referred to as MStrasse and the UBahn station of the same name.Moor in its Greek roots means dark or black but also stupid or primitive Aikins said.MStrasse runs through the old quarter of the former Prussian city steps away from the rebuilt Berlin Palace which oversaw colonial forays into Africa and near the former chancellors residence and venue for the 18841885 Berlin Conference.In the words of Berlinbased BritishUgandan writer Musa Okwonga the major European colonial powers that gathered for the conference discussed how they might divide up Africa. The conference kickstarted Germanys genocidal colonial rule in Namibia. The Mwords overt racist connotations further derive from the 18thcentury practice of bringing enslaved Africans to Germany as court moors to work as servants or entertain the Brandenburg electors and Prussian kings as musicians. The street name given at the beginning of the 18th century transports this racist experience of violence against Black people in Berlin to the present day wrote historian Christian Kopp of Decolonize BerlinMitte.These slaves were mostly brought from the BrandenburgPrussian colony in currentday Ghana then known as the Brandenburger Gold Coast which existed from 1682 to 1721.Who was Anton Wilhelm AmoAnton Wilhelm Amo himself was enslaved as a boy in Ghana and taken to Amsterdam around 1703. He was then gifted to the German Duke of BraunschweigWolfenbttel in 1707 the year MStrasse was named.Encouraged to study by the Duke who paid for his education Amo went on to become the first Africanborn scholar in Europe to complete a PhD in 1734.Despite Amos displacement he embraced his German identity while never forgetting his African heritage. Amos thesis in law at the University of Halle is lost but was titled The Rights of Blacks in Europe which looked at the legal rights of People of Color in the continent.It is said that Amo learned six languages. He later wrote a second doctoral thesis in philosophy that weighed in on philosopher Rene Descartes and his ideas about the duality between mind and body. He also taught classes at the universities in Halle and nearby Jena but made a meager living before returning to Ghana in 1747. The date of his death is unknown.Amo is remembered as the first philosopher of African origin in Germany yet this trailblazer has been largely erased from European intellectual history.The naming of AntonWilhelmAmoStrasse demands a greater appreciation of the scholars work as a philosopher and legal scholar and the professional context in which he worked wrote Anna Orinsky in the online journal EUIdeas. German and international historians philosophers and scholars of many other disciplines are called upon to analyse Amos work she added. But the renaming is also in honor of a symbol of Black resistance says AndreaVicky AmankwaaBirago a Berlinbased cultural scientist focused on decolonization across Germany and Ghana.This renaming signals a change in how we remember  placing Black history achievement and resilience at the center she wrote in August 2025 for internet publication Medium.The long journey to AntonWilhelmAmoStrasseThe MStrasse subway station was itself renamed in 1991 in the wake of reunification. It had previously been called OttoGrotewohlStrasse after a GDR politician.The use of the racist name was called out at the time by the pioneering Black German activist May Ayim a poet of Ghanaian descent who cofounded the Initiative of Black People in Germany in 1986 and edited the defining book Showing Our Colors AfroGerman Women Speak Out. Ayim pursued her efforts to reveal the coded racism in reunified Germany. In the 1990s she was outspoken in her opposition to the street name which in her view stood for the fact that Germanys Black community was not included in the countrys essentially white reunification process after the fall of the Berlin Wall.In 2010 a Kreuzberg riverfront was renamed after Ayim who died in 1996. It was one of the first acts of decolonization the shore having been named after Otto Friedrich von der Groeben who in the late 17th century founded the BrandenburgPrussian colony in Ghana.\n",

      "Under President Trumps immigration policies the US is deporting migrants to African nations including Uganda Eswatini and South Sudan despite concerns over human rights and the capacity of these countries to host more refugees. These deals framed as temporary arrangements have sparked controversy and raised questions about the benefits for the host nations with Nigeria rejecting the proposal outright. AP file photo  US President Donald Trumps crackdown on illegal immigration is a cornerstone of his domestic policy forming part of his controversial campaign pledge to carry out the largest deportation operation in American history.Deporting those migrants to African countries however was not part of the original plan he announced when he ran for the presidency in 2024.But the US Department of Homeland Security said in June that thirdcountry deportations  i.e. sending undocumented migrants from the US to countries other than their own  were necessary to expel people so uniquely barbaric that their own countries wont take them back. Uganda has now become the latest country in East Africa to accept a deal with Washington pledging to take in a yet tobespecified number of migrants who do not qualify to remain in the United States.Alex Vines the head of the Africa Programme at Chatham House a renowned thinktank in London highlights that this agreement builds on schemes between the US with other African nations adopted earlier in the year.In July 2025 a small number of individuals were sent to South Sudan and Eswatini. These were less than ten in total but it shows the direction of travel Vines told DW. The Uganda deal is a lot more ambitious.The Ugandans themselves have said they would not accept people with criminal records or minors and preferred Africans as the ones they would accept Vines further pointed out raising questions about the purpose of the scheme.Uganda a stretchedout refugee nationJust days prior to the confirmation of the deal Ugandas state minister for foreign affairs Henry Oryem Okello claimed the country did not have the capabilities to take in migrants.But after initially denying the deal with the US government Vincent Bagiire the permanent secretary of Ugandas Foreign Affairs Ministry confirmed the deal while saying it was only a temporary arrangement. Uganda already hosts the largest refugee population in Africa with roughly 1.7 million people housed in various camps across the country according to the United Nations.These are for the most part asylumseekers and recognized refugees who hail from other countries in the region such as the Democratic Republic of Congo South Sudan and Sudan.For the most part these immigrant communities live peacefully alongside the local population  but some think this might changeUganda is a hospitable country hosting many refugees. That is not a big thing to us. But already as a host country we are choking says Dorcus Kimono a local living in the capital Kampala.If these migrants are coming to our country we would not mind sharing the little we have with them. But what is the American government doing for usAlex Wandeba another resident of Kampala shares her views Uganda is already overburdened we have many refugees from the neighboring countries. I feel we have enough on the table.Kimono meanwhile wonders how Ugandans will ultimately benefit from the agreement with the United StatesI would want to hear that if a deal is reached with our government that the US is constructing roads or they are going to help us in the health and education sector. That would be a good deal.Eswatini a kingdom with no rightsThough prior US administrations have also conducted thirdcountry removals the Trumps practice of sending immigrants to countries with considerable political and human rights crises have raised alarm among human rights groups.This was particularly notable last month when the US flew five immigrants from Vietnam Jamaica Laos Yemen and Cuba to Eswatini  the last absolute monarchy in Africa which is known for its troubling rights record.Eswatini has been ruled by Mswati III since 1986. The monarch leads a life of luxury while the population of 12 million of the landlocked nation remains poor.The country has a deteriorating human rights record according to Human Rights Watch and according to reports penned by the US State Department itself as recently as 2023.Political Activist Mphandlana Shongwe says there is widespread public anger in Eswatini about the kings decision to allow those immigrants into the country which appears to fall on deaf ears. We condemn the bringing of hardcore convicts to our country to mix with our young convicts who still have a chance to be rehabilitated Shongwe told DW.Government spokesperson Thabile Mdluli meanwhile assured the public that the five inmates pose no threat to the country or its citizens as they were being kept in isolation at least for now.South Sudan wartorn and unsafeConflicttorn South Sudan meanwhile has also agreed to accept immigrants sent by the Trump administration.Edmund Yakani President of the East African Civil Society Organizations Forum told DW that details of the deal were being kept hidden from the public.Alex Vines meanwhile believes that its all about geopolitics. It is about these countries looking at how to diversify their partnerships and engender improved relationships with the Trump administration that might carry money and other benefits longer term to them he said. South Sudan is very much in the crosshairs of the current US administration visa strategy of restricting access to the US because of a history of overstay of South Sudanese Vines further explained adding that there is also the issue of the US tariffs which may be reduced although that has not impacted these countries particularly.Rwanda acting out of good willRwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makolor confirmed that her country would also take up to 250 deportees from the US under the provision that the government maintains the ability to approve each individual proposed for resettlement under the agreement.Elaborating on why Rwanda accepted the US deal Makolo stated the agreement meant that the African country was doing its part to help with international migration issues because our societal values are founded on reintegration and rehabilitation.Other African nations that are known to have been approached by the US for deporatation deals include Liberia Senegal Gabon Mauretania and GuineaBissau.Nigeria has explicitly rejected any proposal by the US with its Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar saying the country already had enough of its own problems.\n",

File photo Elon Musk left and Sergio Gor Picture credit AP X Sergio Gor a close aide to US President Donald Trump has been nominated as the next US Ambassador to India and special envoy for South and Central Asian Affairs.However amid the buzz of his announcement his past clashes with Elon Musk have resurfaced and brought focus on his stormy history with the Tesla founder. Back in June Musk branded Gor a snake after the New York Post revealed he had failed to submit his full security clearance paperwork despite being responsible for vetting thousands of appointees. Musk also accused him of breaking the law by not filing the Standard Form 86 SF86 required for security clearance background checks.According to the Daily Beast Gor allegedly persuaded Trump to withdraw Musks close friend Jared Isaacmans nomination to lead Nasa days before Senate confirmation. Musk said Gor orchestrated Isaacmans downfall to settle scores following a confrontation during his stint on Trumps Department of Government Efficiency DOGE which aimed to slash federal spending. Musk who quit DOGE in May later criticised Gor for delays in staffing and clashed with him during costcutting reviews.According to the Post Gor held a grudge after Musk then serving on Trumps task force publicly criticised him. Sergio was upset about Elon dressing him down at the meeting and said he was going to get him a source told the outlet. The tensions likely added to Musks rupture with Trump in early June when he opposed the presidents sweeping taxcut and spending bill warning it would worsen federal debt. Days later Musk briefly backed impeachment prompting Trump to threaten cancellation of federal contracts with his companies.Announcing the decision on social media Trump described Gor as a great friend who has been at my side for many years and said his appointment to New Delhi was vital at a time when Washington and New Delhi are locked in a bitter tariff dispute.For the most populous region in the world it is important that I have someone I can fully trust to deliver on my agenda and help us make America great again. Sergio will make an incredible Ambassador the president said.He highlighted Gors role in his campaigns book publishing ventures and super PACs calling his service essential to the administration. Vice President JD Vance and US foreign secretary Marco Rubio also welcomed the appointment with Rubio describing USIndia relations as the most important relationship.Gor 38 currently heads the White House Presidential Personnel Office overseeing the recruitment of nearly 4000 federal officials. He will continue in that role until the Senate confirms his appointment. In a post on X Gor said he was beyond grateful to Trump for his trust calling the ambassadorship the honour of my life.Gor will replace Eric Garcetti. His appointment comes as India grapples with 50 per cent US tariffs on its goods including penalties linked to Russian oil purchases.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

      "Donald Trumps claim that fewer than 20 hostages remain alive in Gaza has sparked outrage from families and a swift denial from Israels hostage negotiator. Trump asserted credit for releasing hundreds of hostages a figure disputed by facts. Israeli officials maintain that 50 hostages are still held with 20 believed to be alive while denouncing Hamass extortion tactics. AP file photo  US President Donald Trump said that fewer than 20 hostages held in Gaza remain alive a remark that has drawn anguish from families of the captives and was promptly denied by Israels hostage negotiator. So now they have 20 Trump said while speaking to reporters at the Oval Office on Friday. But the 20 is actually probably not 20 because a couple of them are not around any longer.And you have to understand Im the one who got all of the hostages out Trump said claiming credit for the release of hundreds of captives even though fewer than 150 remained in Gaza when he assumed office on January 20 reported the Times of Israel.Following his remarks the Hostages and Missing Families Forum released a statement that read Mr. President there are 50 hostages. For us each and every one of them is a world in itself.Trump also claimed credit for securing releases during the JanuaryMarch ceasefire denounced Hamass extortion and outlined ongoing efforts to recover the rest of the hostages.The situation has to end its extortion and it has to end Trump said referring to Hamass hostagetaking and negotiations. He added that he believes it would be safer in many ways to free the captives through a military operation rather than a deal with Hamas. Were doing everything we can to get the hostages out its not easy he added.Israels ministry refutes claimsIsraels coordinator for hostage affairs Gal Hirsch said in a statement following Trumps remarks that according to the information we have there is no change in the number of living hostages. Twenty of the hostages are alive two others are in grave danger for their lives 28 are no longer alive and have been declared deceased he wrote to the families.Trump was also questioned about why the United States seems to support Israels move to seize control of Gaza City despite opposition from the families of the hostages who fear the move could endanger their loved ones. Not all of them Trump replied seemingly pointing to a minority of hostage relatives who support Israels expanded operation in Gaza.Israeli officials maintain that 50 hostages are being held in Gaza 49 of the 251 abducted during the Hamasled assault on October 7 2023 along with one captive taken earlier. 28 among them have been confirmed dead by the IDF and authorities believe 20 hostages are still alive. The condition of two others remain in serious doubt. Hamas is also reportedly holding the body of an IDF soldier killed in Gaza in 2014 as per the Times of Israel. Earlier this week Israel advanced further into Gaza pressing ahead with its plan to seize the territory while simultaneously approving thousands of new housing units in the occupied West Bank steps that drew international concern and renewed debate over the prospects of a Palestinian state.Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin the IDFs chief spokesperson announced that Israel has begun the next phase of the war noting that troops had reached the outskirts of Gaza City and were preparing to relocate displaced residents to southern Gaza reported The New York Times.More than 62000 people have been killed in the besieged Gaza Strip since the start of the conflict as per Gazas health ministry.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

      "A mob ambushed ICE officers in San Francisco with one assailant Adrian Guerrero threatening to stab an officer and target his family. Guerrero armed with a knife allegedly slashed a government vehicles tire before confronting the agents resulting in charges of assault and property destruction. San Francisco ICE clashes with protesters charge knifewielding suspect Picture credit DHS Federal authorities on Friday said US Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE officers clashed with protesters in San Francisco this week with one knifewielding suspect now facing charges after allegedly threatening to stab an officer and target his family. The US Department of Homeland Security DHS confirmed the incident happened on Wednesday outside 100 Montgomery Street where ICE agents were carrying out immigration enforcement. Around 1520 demonstrators surrounded four officers spraying pepper spray and physically assaulting them. One officer sustained a jammed finger while others suffered irritation from chemical spray DHS said. Court filings cited by the New York Post identified the suspect as Adrian Guerrero a US citizen. He has been charged with assaulting an officer and destruction of property. Guerrero is accused of slashing the tire of a governmentmarked Chevrolet earlier that morning before confronting ICE agents. While wielding a black knife and wearing a patterned keffiyehstyle scarf with tinted goggles Guerrero allegedly shouted Im going to f you up. Im going to go after your family. Im going to stab you. Photos cited in the complaint show Guerrero confronting agents reported the New York Post. He was arrested still carrying the knife and clothing described. Federal Protective Services and San Francisco police later arrived to help disperse the crowd. According to KQED confrontations with protesters began earlier that morning near the immigration courthouse. An ICE officer peppersprayed both a protester and a reporter who said he was filming the incident when an officer grabbed a bicycle handle and sprayed without provocation. It wasnt provoked  There were no aggressive movements other than me approaching the scene the journalist was quoted as saying by KQED. At least one protester was later detained outside ICEs Sansome Street field office after being tackled ziptied and taken inside.KQED reported that an ICE officer also fired a weapon that released white powder during a scuffle involving a protester and a bike. The confrontation eventually dispersed though many protesters regrouped at the courthouse midmorning. Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem condemned the assault saying ICE officers now face a 1000 increase in assaults while targeting dangerous offenders. These acts of violence are fuelled by sanctuary politicians rhetoric vilifying our law enforcement she said in a DHS statement. We will not and have not let this violence stop us or slow us down she added. The attack follows other violent confrontations with federal agents. In July ten armed men in tactical gear opened fire on an ICE detention centre near Dallas where all suspects were later charged with attempted murder according to the New York Post.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

      "Lyle Menendez convicted with his brother Erik for the 1989 murder of their parents has been denied parole after his first hearing since resentencing. The decision follows a similar rejection for Erik keeping both brothers incarcerated despite their reduced sentences. Lyle Menendez appears before the parole board via teleconference at the Richard J Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego. Picture credit AP Lyle Menendez one of the two brothers convicted of murdering their wealthy parents in Beverly Hills more than three decades ago has been denied parole by a California state panel.The 57yearold who uses his middle name Joseph appeared by video from a San Diego prison on Friday for his first parole hearing since being resentenced earlier this year. After an 11hour closeddoor session commissioners decided he must remain behind bars for at least three more years according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Joseph Lyle Menendez was denied parole for three years at his initial suitability hearing today the department said in a statement as cited by news agency AFP.The ruling follows Thursdays decision in the case of his younger brother Erik 54 whose parole was also rejected. The siblings convicted in 1996 of killing Jose and Kitty Menendez with shotguns in 1989 were originally sentenced to life without parole. A Los Angeles judge reduced those terms in May to 50 years to life making them eligible for release as they were under 26 at the time of the crime as per news agency AP.The Menendez case first shocked America in 1989 when Lyle then 21 and Erik 18 killed their parents inside their Beverly Hills mansion. They initially told investigators it was linked to their fathers business or the Mafia but two months later Erik confessed to a psychologist that he and his brother were responsible. The brothers were arrested in 1990 and later charged with firstdegree murder. Prosecutors said the motive was greed while the defence argued they acted after years of sexual and emotional abuse as per AP.Their first trials in the early 1990s ended with hung juries but in 1995 they were convicted of murder along with lying in wait and special circumstances allegations. They were sentenced the following year to life without parole. For decades appeals were denied by state and federal courts.While in prison the brothers engaged in education led selfhelp classes and even launched a prison beautification project inspired by Norways rehabilitation model according to AP. Their case has also drawn renewed public attention through truecrime shows including Netflixs nineepisode series Monsters The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story.As per The New York Times Fridays hearing was Lyles first chance at release though parole boards rarely grant freedom at an initial review. Both brothers will be eligible for new hearings in three years but could also pursue clemency from California Governor Gavin Newsom or continue legal challenges.According to AP the parole board weighs whether inmates pose an unreasonable risk of danger to society if freed considering their criminal history motivation remorse behaviour in prison and reentry plans. Nearly all of the Menendez family members have backed their release their uncle Milton Andersen one of the few who opposed it died earlier this year.Though formally denied parole for three years the brothers may be reviewed sooner with administrative reconsideration possible within a year and another hearing in as little as 18 months. They also still have a pending habeas corpus petition filed in May 2023 that seeks to reopen their convictions based on new evidence supporting their claims of sexual abuse by their father.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Authorities say the driver became distracted and lost control before overcorrecting causing the bus to veer off the road and roll onto its side news agency AP reported.Major Andre Ray of the New York State Police confirmed that the dead were all adults with passengers ranging in age from one to 74. Many victims were thrown from the vehicle and several became trapped beneath the wreckage before being pulled to safety. Rescue operations continued for hours with helicopters and ambulances transporting more than 40 people to nearby hospitals.Became distracted lost controlPolice said mechanical failure and driver impairment have been ruled out making distraction the most likely cause of the crash. The operator became distracted lost control and overcorrected Ray explained as quoted by AP.The bus operated by MY Tour Inc. of Staten Island had no record of previous accidents in the past two years and carried a satisfactory federal safety rating. The driver survived and is cooperating with investigators.The National Transportation Safety Board has dispatched a team to assist in examining the crash which occurred around 1230 p.m. on the busy New York State Thruway. Witnesses reported seeing the bus swerve into the median before crossing to the shoulder and overturning.Many victims from India China and the PhilippinesAuthorities said most of the passengers were of Indian Chinese and Filipino background and translators were brought to the scene to aid emergency services. Lists provided by the company confirmed 54 people were on board including the driver and a tour company employee.At Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo 24 patients were treated for serious trauma including head injuries and broken bones. Its probably the most trauma patients from one incident in my career here in Buffalo said Dr Samuel Cloud the hospitals chief medical officer. Other patients were flown to the University of Rochester Medical Center where two remained in critical condition.Officials believe many passengers were not wearing seat belts at the time. New York law requires seat belt use on charter buses built after November 2016 though the age of the bus has not been confirmed.Shock and mourningGovernor Kathy Hochul described the accident as a tragedy and said her office was working closely with police and local officials. Our hearts are with their loved ones during this difficult time she said.Eyewitnesses reported seeing shattered glass and belongings scattered across the highway. It was heartbreaking to see. People were embracing each other breaking down said Powell Stephens who drove past the scene.The crash left eastbound lanes of the Thruway closed for hours as investigators worked to clear the wreckage.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

      "The seatbelt sign pings on trays rattle drinks slosh in their glasses. For many flyers air turbulence can be an unnerving experience  and in a world warming under the effects of climate change it is only set to worsen according to a growing body of scientific evidence.Here are the key things to know during another searing summer in 2025.Why turbulence mattersBeyond making people uneasy turbulence is also the leading cause of inflight weather accidents according to official data.The numbers remain relatively small there were 207 reported injuries on US commercial flights between 2009 and 2024. But highprofile incidents have thrust the issue into the spotlight.These include an Air Europa flight last year in which 40 passengers were hurt and a Singapore Airlines flight where one elderly passenger died and dozens were injured.Typically injuries are to unbelted passengers or cabin crew rather than structural damage John Abraham a mechanical engineering professor at the University of St. Thomas told AFP.Modern aircraft withstand turbulence so the main risk is occupant injury not loss of the plane.Still planes must be inspected after severe encounters with turbulence  about 1.5 times the normal force of Earths gravity  which occur some 5000 times a year over the US said Robert Sharman a senior scientist emeritus at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.Turbulence also increases fuel consumption when pilots must leave optimal altitudes alter routes or change speeds Abraham added.How climate change is making it worseMohamed Foudad an atmospheric scientist at the University of Reading in the UK explained there are three main types of turbulence convective mountain wave and clearair turbulence CAT.Convective turbulence is linked to rising or sinking air currents from clouds or thunderstorms that can be detected visually or by onboard radar while mountain wave turbulence occurs over mountain ranges. CAT by contrast is invisible  and therefore the most dangerous.It generally arises from jet streams fastmoving westerly winds in the upper atmosphere at the same altitude as commercial jets about 1012 kilometers up.With climate change the tropics are warming faster at cruising altitude than higher latitudes. That increases the temperature difference between the higher and lowerlatitudes driving up jet stream velocity and wind shear  volatile shifts in vertical air currents that trigger CAT.Foudad and colleagues published a paper last year in the Journal of Geophysical Research Atmospheres analyzing data from 1980 to 2021.We find a clear positive trend  an increase in turbulence frequency over many regions including the North Atlantic North America East Asia the Middle East and North Africa he told AFP with increases ranging from 60 to 155 percent. Further analysis attributed the rising turbulence in certain regions to increased greenhouse gas emissions.What happens nextA 2023 paper led by Isabel Smith at the University of Reading found that for every degree Celsius of nearsurface warming winters would see an increase of about nine percent in moderate CAT in the North Atlantic and summers a rise of 14 percent.Winter has historically been the roughest season for turbulence but warming is now amplifying CAT in summer and autumn closing the gap.Jet stream disruption is not the only concern climate change is also fueling stronger storms.Climate change may also increase the frequency and severity of thunderstorms under future scenarios and turbulence encounters near thunderstorms are a major component of turbulence accidents Sharman told AFP.In terms of mitigation strategies Foudad is working on two studies optimizing flight routes to avoid turbulence hotspots and improving forecasting accuracy.Some airlines are moving towards strategies involving passengers wearing seatbelts more often such as ending cabin service earlier.Promising technologies are also being tested says Sharman including onboard LIDAR which beams lasers into the atmosphere to detect subtle shifts in air density and wind speed.Ultimately cutting greenhouse gas emissions will be essential Foudad added.Aviation is responsible for about 3.5 percent of humancaused warming. Airlines are exploring cleaner fuels to help reduce the industrys footprint though progress has been disappointingly slow according to the International Air Transport Association.\n",

      "A spot of hope Chital returns to Faridabad AravalisIpsita Pati   Aug 22 2025 0307 ISTShareAAText SizeSmallMediumLarge  Gurgaon A spotted deer  or chital  with its distinctive russetbrown coat and white spots was observed near Badkhal lake in the Faridabad Aravalis by forest department officials on Thursday. This sighting is believed to be the first recorded appearance of this species in the district sparking hope and excitement within the wildlife community.Historically the chital roamed freely across the Aravalis stretching from Gurgaon to the Delhi Ridge. However the rapid urbanisation of the 1980s and 1990s  fuelled by mining real estate expansion and deforestation  fragmented their habitats pushing them into core forest zones like the AsolaBhatti wildlife sanctuary. A 2017 Wildlife Institute of India WII survey of Haryanas Aravalis reported a significant decline in wildlife population including that of the spotted deer due to habitat loss and fragmentation.According to officials this is the first confirmed sighting of a spotted deer in the Aravalis in recent records. Vivek Saxena principal chief conservator of forests wildlife said We do not have data on the last sighting of chital in the Aravalis but this sighting definitely shows that habitat improvements helped wildlife return to the region.You Can Also Check Gurgaon AQI  Weather in Gurgaon  Bank Holidays in Gurgaon  Public Holidays in Gurgaon  Gold Rates Today in Gurgaon  Silver Rates Today in GurgaonThe sighting underscores the significance of green spaces at the urban fringe. Badkhal lake is situated at the edge of the Southern Aravali Ridge which connects to the larger Delhi Ridge ecology and links with areas like the AsolaBhatti sanctuary an essential corridor for wildlife in this region.Wildlife when given undisturbed green spaces sometimes ventures back into areas we might consider too crowded. This visit could indicate that the wildlife corridor is active or that native habitat is gradually reclaiming ground. Either way it serves as a subtle reminder of the broader environmental threads still weaving through our daily lives said wildlife biologist Sumit Dookia.If sightings like this become more frequent experts suggested it could be time to consider restoring or strengthening habitat links including corridors between Asola and Sarika where the spotted deer population is currently active.Seeing a spotted deer in Faridabad is a positive sign. It shows that even small patches of forest and wetlands can support wildlife if they are protected. Whats crucial now is to ensure these green spaces remain connected so animals can move safely across the Aravalis said wildlife expert Sunil Harsana.

      "Wildfires have so far ravaged more than one million hectares 2.5 million acres in the European Union in 2025 a record since statistics began in 2006 according to an AFP analysis of data from the European Forest Fire Information System EFFIS.Surpassing the annual record of 988524 hectares burnt in 2017 the figure reached 1015731 hectares by midday Thursday representing an area larger than Cyprus.This calculation is based on a total compiled by AFP from estimates by country by EFFIS at a time when Spain and Portugal are still battling wildfires.Four countries in the European Union  Spain Cyprus Germany and Slovakia  have already experienced their worst year in two decades of existing data. Spain is struggling with numerous fires in the west of the country which have claimed four lives. By far it is the most affected EU country by fires with more than 400000 hectares burnt accounting for nearly 40 percent of the EU total. Portugal which holds the EU record of 563530 hectares burnt in 2017 is the secondmost affected EU country. It has never had an area of this size nearly 274000 hectares burnt as of August 21. Romania follows with 126000 hectares while in France 35600 hectares of forest have been reduced to ashes mostly in the Aude region which was ravaged by a massive fire in early August. These calculations by EFFIS a component of the European climate monitor Copernicus only take into account fires that have burnt areas of at least 30 hectares.\n",

      "Antarctic ice loss could have catastrophic impactDeutsche Welle   Aug 21 2025 1238 ISTShareAAText SizeSmallMediumLarge AI image Scientists on Wednesday warned that abrupt and potentially irreversible changes are occurring in Antarctica. They said the changes which are driven by climate change could lead to catastrophic consequences for generations.The research was published in the journal Nature. It sought to describe the interlocking effects of global warming on the Antarctic the frozen continent at the planets South Pole.The overwhelming evidence of a regime shift in sea ice means that on current trends Antarctica could essentially become ice free in summer sooner than the Arctic the study found.This will speed up warming in the region and beyond and could push some marine species toward extinction.Antarctic sea ice may actually be one of those tipping points in the Earths system said the studys lead author Nerilie Abram a former professor at the Australian National University ANU and now chief scientist at the Australian Antarctic Division.The study warns that curbing global carbon dioxide emissions would reduce the risk of major changes in the Antarctic but still may not prevent them.Once we start losing Antarctic sea ice we set in train this selfperpetuating process Abram said. Even if we stabilize the climate we are committed to still losing Antarctic sea ice over many centuries to come.What did the study sayResearchers gathered data from observations ice cores and ship logbooks to chart longterm changes in the area of sea ice.A rapid and substantial slowdown of the currents has already begun.This would lead to widespread climate and ecosystem impacts ranging from an intensification of global warming to a decrease in the oceans capacity to absorb CO2 the study reported.Will it affect wildlifeSome 90 of the heat generated by manmade global warming is soaked up by oceans.Since 2014 sea ice has retreated on average 120 kilometers 75 miles from the continents shoreline. Loss of ice is harming wildlife including emperor penguins who breed on the ice and krill which feed below it.And warming waters will further reduce phytoplankton populations that draw down vast quantities of carbon from the atmosphere the study reported.\n",

      "Devastating flash floods in Pakistan have claimed at least 657 lives including many children with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province being the hardest hit. Entire villages have been wiped out mass burials are underway and hundreds remain missing as rescue efforts continue amidst warnings of more torrential rains. The scale of destruction is immense with eyewitnesses recounting homes and vehicles swept away.  NEW DELHI Entire villages have been wiped out and mass burials are taking place as flash floods wreak havoc across Pakistan leaving at least 340 people dead and hundreds missing news agency AFP reported. Officials and eyewitnesses described scenes of largescale devastation with homes shops and vehicles swept away in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa KP province the hardesthit region.Meanwhile Pakistans Prime Ministers coordinator for KP affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan warned the real toll could be far higher. Entire villages have been wiped out. In Buners Chagharzi area massive destruction has taken place while the village of Bashoni has completely disappeared from the map he told ARY News. Expressing fear that deaths in Dir alone could exceed 1000 he added Mass burials are taking place. I have returned from Buner with a heavy heart after witnessing this disaster with my own eyes.According to Pakistans National Disaster Management Authority NDMA torrential monsoon rains flash floods and landslides since June 26 have killed at least 657 people including 171 children and 94 women and injured 929. KP province alone has reported 390 deaths.PollShould international aid be prioritized for the flood victims in PakistanYes immediate aid is essentialNo local resources should be utilized firstRescue workers continue to search for survivors but officials admit hopes are fading. In Buner district more than 150 people remain missing with 10 to 12 entire villages partially buried according to local authorities. The chances of those buried under the debris surviving are very slim said Bilal Ahmad Faizi of KPs rescue agency.Eyewitnesses recalled the horror as floodwaters swept away everything in their path. We saw all the houses buildings and vehicles being swept away like pieces of wood. When we looked down from the mountain our home was gone said Suleman Khan a schoolteacher who lost 25 relatives in Buner.Officials say the devastation is on par with past climate disasters in Pakistan. The government has declared several mountainous districts disasterhit while warnings of more torrential rains in the coming days raise fears of further destruction.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

      "A devastating cloudburst in Jammu and Kashmirs Kathua district has claimed seven lives triggering landslides and flash floods. The deluge washed away roads damaged homes and disrupted train services on the JammuPathankot line. Rescue operations are underway with the Army NDRF and SDRF assisting victims.  NEW DELHI A cloudburst in Jammu and Kashmirs Kathua district has left at least seven people dead and several others injured triggering landslides flash floods and largescale disruption. The incident which occurred late Saturday night in Jodh Ghati village washed away roads damaged homes and forced authorities into urgent rescue and relief operations.Train services along the vital JammuPathankot line have also been suspended as rising water levels crossed danger marks on a key railway bridge. Helicopter evacuations have been launched while multiple agencies including the Army NDRF SDRF and police are on the ground to restore connectivity and assist victims.Here are the top developmentsDeath toll rises to seven in KathuaOfficials confirmed that seven people have died in two separate incidents of cloudburst and landslide in Kathua. Five casualties occurred in Jodh Ghati following flash floods triggered by the overnight downpour while two more died after a landslide in Janglote.Jammu Divisional Commissioner Ramesh Kumar said There was heavy rain in Kathua since last night... Seven people have died due to the landslide. Rescue operations are ongoing... Those who died due to the landslide their bodies have been retrieved. Rescue teams are still combing through debris and floodhit areas amid fears of more missing persons. Helicopters were pressed into service due to washedaway roads and villages cut off from access.Train traffic disrupted on JammuPathankot lineRail connectivity has been badly affected with the suspension of upline train movement between Kathua and Budhi. Senior Divisional Commercial Manager Jammu Railway Division Uchit Singhal said Due to heavy rains water is flowing above the danger level through bridge number 43 between KathuaBudhi. In view of this temporarily till the water level subsides upline movement has been suspended and in the meantime up trains are being moved via a temporary single line through the down line track. Villages cut off after flash floods and landslidesThe cloudburst snapped access to Jodh Ghati village where floodwaters swept through homes and agricultural fields leaving families stranded. Several connecting roads were washed away and a bridge collapsed worsening the situation. Deputy Commissioner Kathua Rajesh Sharma confirmed that rescue operations are underway and that stranded people are being shifted to safer areas. Local police reported that a station building in Kathua had also been damaged. Rescue operations led by Army and NDRFThe Indian Army NDRF SDRF police and BRO have been deployed in full strength across Kathua. Heavy machinery has been brought in to fragment massive boulders that rolled down into residential areas. Inspector General of Police Jammu Zone Bhim Sen Tuti said Boulders had fallen here which needed to be fragmented... Heavy machinery has been called for that. With the help of BRO they are being fragmented here. These boulders are being removed by using explosives wherever needed and bodies have been recovered from beneath them.Helicopter evacuation for injured victimsUnion minister Jitendra Singh confirmed that helicopter services were arranged to shift injured people to nearby hospitals. In his social media post Singh wrote Helicopter services have been arranged for shifting the injured to appropriate hospitals. 6 injured have been airlifted for hospitalisation in Mamoon Pathankot which was found to be relatively nearer destination. DIG Police Shiv Kumar Sharma and his team are camping at the site and coordinating airlifts. Centre closely monitoring situation says Amit ShahUnion home minister Amit Shah assured full support from the Central government. In a post on X Shah wrote Spoke with the Lieutenant Governor and Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir regarding the cloudburst in Kathua. Relief and rescue operations are being carried out by the local administration and NDRF teams have also been rushed to the site. Assured every support from the Modi government. We stand firmly behind our sisters and brothers of JK. LG Manoj Sinha calls tragedy mindnumbingJammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha expressed grief over the loss of lives. In his message on X he wrote Deeply anguished by the loss of lives in the devastating raintriggered landslides in several areas of Kathua. The tragedy is mindnumbing. Briefed Honble Union Home Minister Sh. Amit Shah Ji on rescue and relief operations by the army NDRF SDRF police  administration. CM Omar Abdullah announces exgratia reliefChief minister Omar Abdullah conveyed condolences and directed immediate assistance for affected families. A statement from his office said Rs 2 lakh would be given for each deceased Rs 1 lakh for severely injured and Rs 50000 for those with minor injuries. Compensation has also been announced for damaged homes Rs 1 lakh for fully damaged houses Rs 50000 for severely damaged houses and Rs 25000 for partially damaged houses. The Chief Minister has directed the administration to carry out immediate relief rescue and evacuation measures to ensure the safety and support of affected families the statement said.Repeated cloudburst disasters in JKThe Kathua disaster comes just three days after a cloudburst in Kishtwars Chisoti village killed 60 people and injured over 100. Experts warn that frequent extreme weather in JK is linked to changing rainfall patterns and climate pressures in the Himalayan region. Officials say the backtoback incidents highlight the need for stronger disaster preparedness and better drainage infrastructure. While the state government has sought central assistance locals in Kathua have urged longterm flood protection measures. This includes improved embankments realtime weather alerts and a review of building norms in vulnerable areas.Connectivity and services slowly being restoredAuthorities are now focused on restoring essential services including power water and road links. In Kishtwar where floods occurred earlier officials said blasting of boulders was undertaken to clear blocked roads. Rope bridges are being built to reconnect cutoff villages in Kathua. The power supply and water supply have been restored. A bridge is being built here with the help of the Army... All the passengers stranded in Machail were safely evacuated yesterday said Divisional Commissioner Ramesh Kumar.

      "Wildfires continue to test firefighters and locals across Europe as droughts and heatwaves turn regions into tinderboxes. The data for 2025 alone is a sign of things to come. A cruel summer as record wildfires scorch Europe Wildfires continue to burn across the south of Europe amid recordbreaking summer heatwaves in many fireprone regions. In some places these fires have been exacerbated by wet spring months which have helped vegetation growth capable of catching alight with ease during a dry summer.Already an area equivalent to 1.5 times the size of Luxembourg  roughly 438568 hectares  has burned across Europe in 2025. That figure is almost three times the size of fire damaged caused up to the same point in 2024.It comes as some parts of southern Europe suffer through multiple 40degree 104 Fahrenheit days and prolonged heatwaves lasting a fortnight.The current summer has been described as the worst for wildfires in two decades.Where are the fires burning What is the situation right nowWere seeing extreme temperatures in large parts of Europe records being broken of 40 degrees in many places said Julie Berckmans a climate scientist at the European Environmental Agency.Southern France Spain Greece Turkey Belgium Netherlands UK are all hitting high temperatures and massive wildfires in Spain Portugal France Greece Turkey Albania.In Spain those fires have burned through an area the size of London already.Portugal is fighting its own fires with around four thousand firefighters currently active across seven active sites. It has also been forced to request help from the European Unions firefighting forces.An even greater number of firefighters has been mobilized in Greece which is battling 20 blazes during this peak fire season.Deaths have occurred in Spain Portugal Montenegro and Italy from fires and heatrelated events this summer.It has been a severe fire seasonEurope uses data from its Copernicus satellite fleet to monitor fire activity and collates the data via the European Forest Fires Information System EFFIS.A substantial amount of fire damage in 2025 has already occured.More than 250000 hectares more of land has burnt than the same time in 2024.There have more than 1600 fires across Europe compared to just under 1100 last year.And new regions are also experiencing greater than usual fire activity.Spain for instance has seen twice as much of its territory burnedthrough compared to the 20062024 average. Romania has lost four times as much land to fires this year.Cyprus has been badly impacted. It could usually expect to see around 0.32 of its landmass burned each year. Already in 2025 its 2.5  nearly eight times more.But its also the number of fires that is concerning. France has had nearly three times as many fires as average amid what has been the worst wildfire season for its southern regions in decades.More to come...The fallout of severe wildfires goes beyond land loss or human fatalities. Damage to ecosystems through vegetation loss health impacts through smoke inhalation and economic decline are all consequences of widespread fire events.Its about 2.5 billion 2.9 billion of damage lost every year in the EU Berckmans told DW. 45000 people on average were displaced due to wildfires from 2008 to 2023.The European Environment Agencys first climate risk assessment published in 2024 found that urgent action is required to address the critical risk wildfires will pose to populations and infastructure and biodiversity in southern Europe.Wildfires are an urgent risk to address said Berckmans. Its also a major risk that needs more action now in the rest of Europe.As European fall approaches the number of fires and the damage they cause should slow. However forecasting the length of fire danger season and the behavior of fires themselves is becoming more difficult.Climate change will not only generate warmer and drier conditions across southern Europe it will also begin to change other dynamic factors.Faster and more volatile wind systems for instance will increase the challenge for fire management personnel to predict how blazes will behave. That puts the lives of emergency workers and civilians at greater risk.Picture a fire so fierce so fast and so unpredictable it seems alive capable of reshaping the weather around it and leaping across kilometers in a heartbeat said Antonio Lopez an expert in wildfires at the University of Seville Spain.\n",

      "Marking Independence Day celebrations the Prime Minister announced and hailed the achievement as a pivotal step towards an Atmanirbhar Bharat in the energy sector underscoring the countrys transformation from a fossilfueldependent importer to a global clean energy leader.When the world today expresses concern over global warming I wish to tell the world that Bharat has resolved to achieve 50 per cent clean energy by 2030. That was our target for 2030. Look at the capability of my countrymen look at their determination to fulfil the resolve of making Bharat developedwe achieved the 50 per cent clean energy target in 2025 itself five years ahead of schedule. This is because we are as sensitive towards the world as we are responsible towards nature PM Modi said on the occasion of 79th Independence.At COP26 held in 2021 India committed to an ambitious fivepart Panchamrit pledge.This included reaching 500 GW of nonfossil electricity capacity generating half of all energy requirements from renewables and reducing emissions by 1 billion tonnes by 2030. India also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent and achieve netzero emissions by 2070.According to the latest government data India added a record 29.52 gigawatts GW of renewable capacity in 202425 taking total installed renewable energy RE capacity to 234.24 GW excluding nuclear up from 198.75 GW last year.Solar energy leads the charge with installed capacity skyrocketing from just 2.82 GW in 2014 to 116.24 GW today now accounting for nearly half of Indias total RE capacity.Wind power follows at 51.67 GW while large and small hydro contribute 54.72 GW combined. Biopower has also grown to 11.59 GW over the past decade.India now ranks 4th globally in total RE capacity 3rd in solar power and 4th in wind energy boasting the worlds fastestgrowing renewable program.The clean energy surge has been powered by a suite of ambitious government reforms and programs.The PMSurya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana with a Rs 75021 crore outlay aims to provide free solar electricity to one crore households.As of August 14 2025 over 17.24 lakh households have benefitted with subsidies worth Rs 9841.77 crore released. The scheme also introduced Model Solar Villages to promote decentralised clean power at the grassroots level.In agriculture the PMKUSUM scheme has installed over 8.53 lakh solar pumps replacing dieselpowered systems and cutting an estimated 6.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.Beyond solar India is expanding in wind hydro bioenergy green hydrogen and nuclear power. Offshore wind projects backed by a Rs 7453 crore viability gap funding scheme are set to add 1 GW capacity off Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.The National Green Hydrogen Mission with a Rs 19744 crore budget targets 5 million metric tonnes MMT annual production by 2030 along with 125 GW of new RE Rs 8 lakh crore in investments and 6 lakh jobs. Hydrogen hubs have been identified in Kandla Paradip and Tuticorin.In the nuclear sector operational capacity has grown from 4780 MW in 2014 to 8780 MW across 25 reactors with a remarkable 87 per cent plant load factor in 202425. Ten new reactors are already functional and capacity is set to increase tenfold by 2047.The result is a virtuous cycle local manufacturing creates jobs and resilience competitive tariffs make clean energy affordable and inclusive programs bring every citizen into the transition. As we look ahead to 2030 and beyond India is not just meeting global commitments  it is setting a new template for how a nation can grow decarbonise and remain selfreliant. In the journey from energy dependence to energy leadership the momentum is unmistakable and the destination is clear an Atmanirbhar Bharat powered by its own clean green energy the government said today in a factsheet.With five years gained on its clean energy target India is now firmly on track to meet and potentially exceed its 500 GW nonfossil capacity goal by 2030 positioning itself as a decisive force in the global fight against climate change.

      "A multimillion pound conservation programme in England helped save 150 struggling species but time is running out to halt the decline the head of Natural England which led the initiative said Wednesday.The public body responsible for protecting and enhancing Englands natural environment invested a 13 million 17.6 million grant in efforts to support animal and plant species such as water vole oystercatcher ladys slipper orchid the hazel dormouse and Atlantic salmon. From the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall to Cumbria and Northumberland 63 different projects involving 78 partners have transformed landscapes and supported the recovery of 150 species many of which were on the brink of national extinction through research captive breeding habitat creation and conservation translocations the body said in a statement released Wednesday.More than 15000 individual animals and plants were translocated to expand species territories under the projects which ran from August 2023 to March 2025. Notable successes include the reintroduction of black grouse to the North Yorkshire Moors northern England and the return of the large marsh grasshopper to the Norfolk Broads in east England after an 85year absence. Despite the achievements the chair of Natural England Tony Juniper warned more needed to be done. A rising number of nature recovery projects both large and small are making a huge difference up and down the country he said in the press release.We know we can turn round species decline and improve ecosystems with the right targeted actions the drive and the funding. But time is running out fast he added.Juniper called for more projects more volunteers and more investment particularly from the private sector.\n",

      "Typhoon Podul crossed southern Taiwan prompting school and office closures due to heavy rain and potential agricultural damage. While no major damage was reported in Taiwan one person is missing on the east coast. In China coastal provinces evacuated around 15000 residents as the storm moved towards the Taiwan Strait impacting flights and regions south of Taipei.  KAOHSIUNG Thousands of people sheltered and fishermen secured their boats across stormbattered southern Taiwan on Wednesday as Typhoon Podul intensified on its approach to the island.The typhoon is packing wind speeds of 155 kilometres 96 miles per hour at its centre and is strengthening Central Weather Administration CWA forecaster Lin Tingyi told AFP.Podul is on track to hit lightly populated Taitung County at around noon 0400 GMT before sweeping across the island and into the Taiwan Strait.We are worried about this typhoon Kaohsiung fisherman Huang Wei told AFP as he used more ropes to tie down his boat and checked on other vessels.We had already made general typhoon preparations yesterday but this morning I woke up and saw news reports that the typhoon has intensified to be as strong as the last Typhoon Krathon Huang said.Last time the two boats behind us werent tied properly and hit my boat.Krathon slammed into Kaohsiung in October with wind gusts of 162kph. Podul has gusts of 191kph Lin said. More than 5500 people have been evacuated from their homes ahead of Podul disaster officials said Wednesday as the typhoon threatens to pound central and southern regions that are still recovering from storms last month.Mountainous areas of Kaohsiung City and neighbouring Pingtung County as well as Hualien and Taitung counties could see torrential rain the CWA said.All domestic flights across the island of 23 million people have been cancelled along with dozens of international journeys.Many ferry services have been suspended and businesses and schools across the south closed.Typhoon Danas which hit Taiwan in early July killed two people and injured hundreds as the storm dumped more than 500mm about 20 inches of rain across the south over a weekend.That was followed by torrential rain from July 28 to August 4 with some areas recording more than Taiwans rainfall of 2.1 metres for 2024.The week of bad weather left five people dead three missing and 78 injured a disaster official said previously.\n",

      "Talks on forging a landmark treaty to combat the scourge of plastic pollution were stumbling Saturday with progress slow and countries wildly at odds on how far the proposed agreement should go.The negotiations which opened on Tuesday have four working days left to strike a legallybinding instrument that would tackle the growing problem choking the environment.In a blunt midway assessment talks chair Luis Vayas Valdivieso warned the 184 countries negotiating at the United Nations that they had to get shifting to get a deal.Progress made has not been sufficient Vayas told delegates.A real push to achieve our common goal is needed the Ecuadoran diplomat said adding that Thursday was not a just deadline but a date by which we must deliver.Some articles still have unresolved issues and show little progress towards reaching a common understanding Vayas lamented.The key fracture is between countries that want to focus on waste management and others who want a more ambitious treaty that also cuts production and eliminates use of the most toxic chemicals.And with the talks relying on finding consensus it has become a game of brinkmanship.A diplomatic source told reporters that many informal meetings had been scrambled together for Sundays day off to try and break the deadlock.If nothing changes we wont get there the source added.Battle of the bracketsCountries have reconvened in Geneva after the failure of the supposedly fifth and final round of negotiations in Busan South Korea in 2024.After four days of talks the draft text has ballooned from 22 to 35 pages  with the number of brackets in the text going up near fivefold to almost 1500 as countries insert a blizzard of conflicting wishes and ideas.The talks are mandated to look at the full life cycle of plastic from production to pollution but some countries are unhappy with such a wide scope.Kuwait spoke up for the socalled LikeMinded Group  a nebulous cluster of mostly oilproducing nations which rejects production limits and wants to focus on treating waste.Let us agree on what we can agree. Consensus must be the basis of all our decisions Kuwait insisted.Nudging in the same direction Saudi Arabia speaking for the Arab Group said the responsible way ahead was to start considering what bits of the text may not make it to the final outcome due to irreconcilable divergence.But given how little is truly agreed on Uruguay warned that consensus cannot be used as a justification to not achieve our objectives.Eirik Lindebjerg global plastics adviser for the World Wide Fund for Nature told AFP that the LikeMinded Groups proposal was another attempt to make it a waste management agreement and to stifle talks on reducing the amount of plastic in circulation.Path through the fogThe UN Environment Programme is hosting the talks and swiftly called a press conference after the stocktake session.UNEP executive director Inger Andersen said a deal was really within our grasp even though today it might not look so.Despite the fog of negotiations Im really encouraged she told reporters insisting There is a pathway to success.Vayas added We need to accelerate. We need a better rhythm in this and we need to also work in such a way that it will be clear that we will deliver by the end.Afterwards Bjorn Beeler executive director at IPEN a global network aimed at limiting toxic chemicals told AFP This whole process has not been able to take decisions and is still collecting ideas. Were sleepwalking towards a cliff and if we dont wake up were falling off.Profits from poisoningPlastic pollution is so ubiquitous that microplastics have been found on the highest mountain peaks in the deepest ocean trench and scattered throughout almost every part of the human body.More than 400 million tonnes of plastic are produced globally each year half of which is for singleuse items.Plastic production is set to triple by 2060.Panamas negotiator Juan Monterrey Gomez took the floor to slam those countries wanting to stop the treaty from encompassing the entire life cycle of plastic.He said microplastics are in our blood in our lungs and in the first cry of a newborn child. Our bodies are living proof of a system that profits from poisoning us. We cannot recycle our way out of this crisis.\n",

      "Tropical bird populations have plummeted not only due to deforestation but also extreme heat attributable to climate change according to a study published on Monday in the journal Nature Ecology  Evolution. Intensifying temepratures caused a 2538 percent reduction in tropical bird populations between 1950 and 2020 compared to a scenario without manmade global warming scientists based in Europe and Australia reported. The findings are pretty stark lead author Maximilian Kotz a researcher at the National Supercomputing Centre in Barcelona and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research PIK told AFP.Bird populations in the tropics now face 30 days of heat extremes per year compared to three per year in the mid20th century he noted. This has major consequences for how we think about biodiversity conservation Kotz said by email. Protecting pristine habitats is crucial but without dealing with climate change it wont be enough for birds.Nearly half of all bird species are found in biodiversityrich tropical regions. These often colourful animals perform essential services for ecosystems such as dispersing plant seeds. Invasive species another threatBut birds living in these regions may already be close to the limits of their tolerance to high temperatures which can cause heatstroke hyperthermia or dehydration. The overview study does not provide figures for individual species but earlier literature is rich with examples of the devastating impact of rising temperatures.One documented the heatrelated decline of birds in Panama including the king quetzal the redcrested quetzal the twocoloured kingfisher and the aurora trogon. Another study published in 2017 showed how some tropical hummingbirds are now forced to seek shade to regulate their temperature in extreme heat cutting into the amount of time they can spend searching for lifesustaining nectar. Extreme heat waves which are becoming more frequent represent a far greater threat than increases in average temperatures or rainfall another result of humaninduced climate change. Up to now it has been assumed that the decline in bird populations worldwide was due mainly to other wellidentified factors especially habitat loss pesticide use hunting and invasive species especially snakes that snack on bird eggs and mosquitos carrying avian malaria. But the new findings challenge the view that direct human pressures have so far been the dominant driver of impacts on bird populations compared to climate change in tropical regions according to the authors. To reach this conclusion they analysed observational data from more than 3000 bird populations around the world and used statistical modelling to isolate the effects of extreme weather from other factors.The findings help complete the picture of tropical bird decline noted Aimee Van Tatenhove a postdoctoral fellow at Cornell Universitys Center for Avian Population Studies who was not involved in the study.Deforestation has an obvious impact  trees are cut and habitat is destroyed she told AFP. We need longterm datasets like the authors used to understand how extreme temperatures impact avian populations.This study is an important reminder that we need to continue examining different causes of population declines and apply those findings to conservation initiatives she continued.\n",

      "Turkey reports hottest July in 55 yearsAFP   Aug 9 2025 1559 ISTShareAAText SizeSmallMediumLarge  Turkey recorded its hottest July in 55 years the environment ministry said Saturday.Temperatures recorded in 66 of the countrys 220 weather stations showed an average rise of 1.9 degrees over the preceding years the ministry said on X.The highestever recorded temperature of 50.5 C was also set near the end of July in Silopi southeast Turkey. Silopi a city in the Sirnak province is located around 10 kilometres from the Iraq and Syrian borders. It shattered the previous national high of 49.5 C recorded in August 2023 in the western province of Eskisehir. Turkey has faced weeks of scorching heat along with several wildfires. Fourteen people lost their lives battling blazes last month in the western part of the country. Hundreds of people were evacuated on Friday in the northwest province of Canakkale where the busy Dardanelles Strait was closed to maritime traffic due to two raging fires. The heatwave has also prompted fears of water shortages in some areas.

      "At a beach near Algiers brown algae native to the Pacific Ocean cover the golden sand posing a threat to ecosystems native to the area and their stench repelling swimmers at the peak of summer.Following a recent government call to help clear beaches swarmed by the seaweed species known scientifically as Rugulopteryx okamurae several volunteers and charities have stepped in.When it washes up we cant swim said Salim Hemmedi a 43yearold vacationer at a beach in Sidi Fredj where volunteers raked up heaps of the plant.We hope the situation will improve so that we can enjoy ourselves... and that children can swim in peace.The alga originates from temperate waters around Japan and the Korean peninsula in the northwest Pacific Ocean.It was first spotted in Algeria in late 2023 according to Lamia Bahbah a lecturer and researcher at the National School of Marine Sciences and Coastal Planning.And lately some have noted that it has been increasingly washed ashore.Youcef Segni a marine engineer and biologist said the algae proliferated at a significantly higher rate than in 2023 and 2024.They invade the habitats of other algae in the seabed which leads to the disappearance of some species he said adding that it can also displace some native fish.Fast reproductionIn France Spain and Portugal the Rugulopteryx okamurae species has also been observed.Earlier this year Spanish football club Real Betis introduced kits repurposed from seaweed to raise awareness about the issue.A 2023 study by the Marine Drugs journal said the algas invasive character led to a replacement of the native biota and an occupancy rate that reached almost 100 per cent in some locations in Portugal.In Algeria the plant has been spotted in at least three of the countrys 14 coastal provinces including the capital where 16 beaches are affected authorities said.Are the waters suitable for swimming Yes said Environment Minister Nadjiba Djilali during the cleanup campaign adding there were no records of the plant causing allergies.Researcher Bahbah said stopping its proliferation was unfortunately impossible at this stage.She said the plant reproduces at a high rate both sexually and asexually.The species can reproduce through fragmentation meaning new individual algae can develop from fragmented pieces of other Rugulopteryx okamurae algae.The algae spread mainly by clinging to the hulls of boats and the Mediterraneans moderate temperature favours the seaweeds fast reproduction.We are going to fight it said Fella Zaboudj a state engineer in marine sciences adding that researchers were monitoring its spread development and evolution.Zaboudj said research was also underway to determine whether the algae could be repurposed as fertiliser.\n",

      "On Irelands blustery western seaboard researchers are gleefully flying giant kites  not for fun but in the hope of generating renewable electricity and sparking a revolution in wind energy. Irelands wind energy sector has long been touted as full of potential. AI image BANGOR On Irelands blustery western seaboard researchers are gleefully flying giant kites not for fun but in the hope of generating renewable electricity and sparking a revolution in wind energy.We use a kite to capture the wind and a generator at the bottom of it that captures the power Padraic Doherty of Kitepower the Dutch firm behind the venture told AFP. At its test site in operation since September 2023 near the small town of Bangor Erris the team transports the vast 60squaremetre 645000squarefeet kite from a hangar across the lunarlike bogland to a generator. The kite is then attached by a cable tether to the machine and acts like a yoyo or fishing reel Doherty said.It gets cast out and flies up the tether pulls it back in over and over again creating energy he said testing the kites ropes and pulleys before a flight.The sparsely populated spot near the stormy Atlantic coast is the worlds first designated airborne renewable energy test site. And although the idea is still small in scale it could yet prove to be a mighty plan as Ireland seeks to cut its reliance on fossil fuels such as oil and gas.We are witnessing a revolution in wind energy said Andrei Luca operations head at Kitepower a zeroemissions energy solutions spinoff from the Delft University of Technology.It took nearly 25 years for wind turbines to evolve from 30kilowatt prototypes to megawatt scale and decades to offshore wind farms we see today he added.The system flies autonomously driven by software developed at the university in the Netherlands but Doherty acts as the kites pilot on the ground monitoring its flight path for efficiency. The kite flies up around 400 metres 1300 feet and reels in to about 190 metres generating around 30 kilowatts for storage.The force spins like a dynamo on a bike Doherty said adding that it generates up to two and a half tonnes of force through each turn.The electricity is stored in batteries similar to solar photovoltaic systems with the kite currently able to fully charge a 336kilowatthour kWh battery.Thats a meaningful amount of energy sufficient for powering a remote outpost a small island polar station or even a construction site Luca said.Add additional kites and we can power a bigger island.Mobile flexibleAccording to Doherty a chief advantage of the kite system is its flexibility and swift startup capability.We can set up in 24 hours and can bring it anywhere its super mobile and doesnt need expensive time and energyconsuming turbine foundations to be built he said. A kite system is way less invasive on the landscape than wind turbines produces clean energy and doesnt need a supply chain of fuel to keep running Luca added.During Januarys Storm Eowyn which caused widespread and longlasting power outages in Ireland the system showed its value in Bangor Erris according to Luca. Paired with a battery it provided uninterrupted electricity before during and after the storm he said. Irelands wind energy sector has long been touted as full of potential.But progress on largescale delivery of onshore and offshore turbines has been held up by planning delays and electricity grid capacity constraints.The Irish government has set ambitious targets for offshore wind energy to deliver 20 gigawatts of energy by 2040 and at least 37 gigawatts by 2050.In 2024 Irish wind farms provided around a third of the countrys electricity according to Wind Energy Ireland WEI a lobby group for the sector. This compares to the UK where according to trade association RenewableUK wind energy from the countrys combined wind farms first reached 20 gigawatts in November 2022.The ability of airborne wind energy AWE systems to harness highaltitude winds with relatively low infrastructure requirements makes them particularly suitable for remote offshore or mobile applications Mahdi Salari an AWE researcher at University College Cork told AFP.But he said Kitepower would face challenges on regulation safety and system reliability. Such technology however could plug gaps in places where land availability costs or logistical constraints hinder the deployment of traditional wind turbines Salari said.By the 2030s he said I expect AWE to contribute meaningfully to diversified flexible and distributed renewable energy networks.Discover stories of Indias leading ecoinnovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025\n",

      "Aalborg Zoo in Denmark is now accepting unwanted small pets as donations to feed its predators. The zoo assures that donated animals like rabbits and guinea pigs will be humanely euthanized before being used as food. This initiative aims to mimic the natural food chain promoting animal welfare and natural behaviour among captive carnivores. Ai generated image  If you have a pet you can no longer keep one zoo in Denmark is offering an unusual option.Aalborg Zoo is asking the public to donate small pets  not for rehoming but to be used as food for its captive predators.Aalborg Zoo located in northern Denmark said in a Facebook post that the move is meant to mimic the natural food chain of animals housed there. The zoo says this effort supports animal welfare and professional integrity and assures that any donated pets will be gently euthanized by trained staff.If you have a healthy animal that needs to be given away for various reasons feel free to donate it to us the post said.The zoo lists rabbits guinea pigs horses and chickens as examples of suitable donations.PollWhat do you think about Aalborg Zoos practice of accepting pets for food for predatorsSupport it for animal welfareOppose it find other solutionsOnce euthanised the animals will be used as fodder for the zoos carnivores.That way nothing goes to waste  and we ensure natural behaviour nutrition and wellbeing of our predators the zoo claimed.The post is accompanied by a picture of a wildcat showing its teeth with its mouth wide open. It also includes a link to the zoos website.About the zoo Aalborg Zoo was founded in April 1935. The facility is located near the centre of Aalborg and spans 8 hectares. It houses more than 1500 animals across 126 species and draws hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.According to the zoos official website Aalborg Zoo focuses on conservation sustainability and education.It takes part in international breeding programmes for endangered species and supports global efforts in animal conservation research and fair trade. It was also the first zoo in Denmark to receive an environment certificate and is known for its work in protecting nature and the environment.The zoo maintains that the practice of using donated pets as prey aligns with its mission to support natural behaviours in captive predators.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

      "Teen Innovator Soars to New Heights Mehar Singh Breaks Guinness World Record with LightningFast Drone AscentMediawire   Aug 28 2024 1635 ISTShareAAText SizeSmallMediumLargeAt just 17 years old Mehar Singh has soared into the spotlight by shattering the Guinness World Record for the fastest 100meter ascent by a quadcopter. Mehars customengineered drone reached this remarkable milestone in an astonishing 0.91 seconds a feat that not only demonstrates his technical prowess but also sets a new benchmark in the rapidly evolving world of drone technology.Mehars journey to this achievement has been anything but straightforward. His fascination with drones began in 8th grade and this passion has only deepened over the years. With a keen interest in pushing technological boundaries Mehar embarked on a monthslong project to build a drone capable of unparalleled vertical acceleration.Ive always been fascinated by the idea of pushing the limits of what drones can do Mehar explained. But breaking a world record wasnt just about the end result it was about the process. I wanted to prove that current technology could achieve something extraordinary but the path to get there was filled with challenges.The project required Mehar to design test and refine multiple drone prototypes. There were moments when I felt like I was chasing an impossible dream Mehar recalled. I went through countless designs and many of them failed during testing. Some drones crashed so badly that I had no choice but to go back to the drawing board and start from scratch. Each crash was a setback but it also sparked new ideas and innovations.Undeterred by the setbacks Mehar poured his energy into creating a drone that was not only fast but also aerodynamically optimized. I spent countless hours on CAD software meticulously designing and tweaking each component. The goal was to make the drone as streamlined as possible which led me to shape it like a rocket. This design wasnt just about aesthetics it was about reducing drag and maximizing speed.Mehars dedication to his craft paid off in spectacular fashion. Every failure taught me something valuable he said. It forced me to think creatively and to consider every detail from the materials used to the weight distribution of the drone. The process was grueling but it was also incredibly rewarding to see my ideas take flightliterally.This recordbreaking achievement is more than just a personal triumph for Mehar it has significant implications for the future of drone technology. The possibilities are endless Mehar mused. Highspeed vertical acceleration could revolutionize everything from emergency response to space exploration. This isnt just about setting a record its about opening doors to new innovations and applications.Mehars groundbreaking work has already begun to inspire others in the drone community and beyond. I hope this accomplishment encourages other young innovators to push their own boundaries he said. Technology is advancing rapidly and theres so much potential waiting to be unlocked. Im excited to see where we can go from here.As Mehar looks ahead the sky is truly the limit. With his recordbreaking drone he has not only made history but also set the stage for future breakthroughs in drone technology. And for this young innovator this is just the beginning of an exciting journey into the future of flight.Disclaimer Content produced by Mediawire on Behalf of Shweta Singh\n",

Doordarshan said that the morning aarti offered to Ram Lalla will be telecast live on DD National every morning from 630 am.The national broadcaster said that the decision to telecast the morning aarti live every day was taken with the aim of connecting devotees of Lord Ram especially after the temple was inaugurated less than two months ago in a grand ceremony and everyone cant visit the temple in person. The Aarti will be telecast simultaneously on DDs YouTube channel also.Secondly the decision was taken because the Trust doesnt have logistical arrangements as of now for a live broadcast. Therefore DD will be posting a twothreemember crew on the temple premises for the coverage of the daily ritual.DDs announcement to telecast the Aarti live for 30 minutes every morning comes after getting the goahead from the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust for the same.

      "Microsoft discontinues Surface Duo smartphones but files a patent for a new foldable device with a single hinge system called spine cover plate. The design aims to eliminate the hinge crease and reduce the devices thickness while offering added benefits and durability. However its practicality remains uncertain. Microsoft did not get the success it was anticipating with its Androidpowered Surface Duoseries smartphones. The company has discontinued the lineup after the Duo 2. But this does not mean the company has stopped trying. A new patent application filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29 reveals that the company is working on another foldable or dualdisplay mobile device.The patent application describes the companys take on the foldable smartphone concept with single hinge technology called spine cover plate.Next Microsoft smartphones could feature a Galaxy Z Foldlike designAccording to the patent application the phone could feature a flexible display in a bookstyle design similar to Galaxy Z Fold decies. However the entire focus is on the spine cover plate mechanism which is aimed at protecting the singlehinge system of the device by covering the structural element. The differentiating factor between the regular hinge and Microsofts design is that the spine cover adjusts automatically during the opening and closing of the phone to prevent any unnecessary gaps around the hinge to protect it from dust as well as water. Currently Samsungs design offers an IPX8 rating which makes their foldables waterresistant only.The patent further mentions that the new hinge mechanism could allow Microsoft to eliminate the hinge crease less visible than the current options available in the market. Moreover Microsoft has also mentioned techniques that could allow them to reduce the overall thickness of the foldable smartphone by allowing the spine cover plate to move closer to the devices hinge when folded. By retracting the spine cover plate toward the central spine as the first displaysupporting frame and the second displaysupporting frame are rotated into a facetoface orientation the width of the folded computing device is reduced thereby enabling easier and more comfortable handling of the device such as with one hand Microsoft noted in the patent.Interesting idea but practicality is a question markThe entire smartphone market is searching for a way to eliminate the foldable crease from their smartphones. Some brands have already implemented the waterdrop folding mechanism to reduce it but theres nothing like a creasefree foldable out there. Apart from that the durability quotient of foldable is also important considering all the movable parts these phones have. That said adding another layer or a movable part on top of the entire foldable mechanism does not appear like a wise move despite the added benefits and durability Microsoft has explained in the patent application.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Musk obviously didnt like the jab and replied with a longish message saying GPT4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.  Elon Musk has been extremely critical of ChatGPT maker OpenAI for deviating from its mission to develop AI for the benefit of humanity and taking a profitmaking path. He has advocated that artificial intelligence AI should be accessible for all and he has now announced that his AI startup xAI will open source Grok chatbot this week.This week xAI will open source Grok Musk said in a post on X formerly Twitter.In simpler words opensourcing a software like a chatbot means that the software projects are redistributable as all source code is accessible by everyone. One of the advantages of having open source software is that it provides flexibility to an enterprise to have multiple ways of fixing a problem rather than waiting for an internal team to provide a solution.OpenAI is a lieMeanwhile a user suggested that OpenAI should do the same.OpenAI should do the same if they are open that is the user said. Musk replied OpenAI is a lie.Musk wants AI technology to be opensource Musk had floated the idea of opensourcing AI during a podcast in November last year. In a podcast with Lex Fridman Musk suggested that he likes the idea of opensource AI. I am generally in favour of open sourcing like biassed towards open sourcing he said.His comments came soon after his AI company called xAI released Grok its chatbot which reportedly took four months to build. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was quick to take a dig at this and shared a post in which he built Grok with a single prompt on GPT Builder.GPTs can save a lot of effort he said.Musk obviously didnt like the jab and replied with a longish message saying GPT4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.

      "Bobby Kotick former head of Activision Blizzard may buy TikTok amid its potential US ban. A bill to sell TikTok is introduced backed by President Biden. Kotick discussed acquisition with OpenAI head. Activision Blizzard faced a lawsuit. Concerns about data privacy and ties to China persist. TikTok urges American users to support it.  Bobby Kotick the former head of Activision Blizzard is reportedly considering buying TikTok as the app could be banned in the United States. The Wall Street Journal reports that Kotick has talked to ByteDance the company that owns TikTok about buying the app which could cost hundreds of billions of dollars.This comes as US lawmakers introduce a new bill that would make ByteDance sell TikTok within six months or stop it from being available in US app stores.President Joe Biden has said he would approve the bill if it passes in Congress.The Wall Street Journal report adds that Kotick the head of OpenAI Sam Altman discussed teaming up to buy TikTok at a dinner last week. Koticks interest in TikTok follows a rough end to his 30 years leading Activision Blizzard which Microsoft acquired last year. The company faced a lawsuit saying it allowed sexual harassment and discrimination under Koticks leadership. The Wall Street Journal also said Kotick knew about bad behaviour and didnt tell the board everything. Kotick was accused of harassment but Activision Blizzard said the report was misleading.Lawmakers are worried about data privacy and TikToks ties to China. US President Biden whose administration has banned the app already on state devices has expressed his support for banning the app in the US. However former President Donald Trump who once wanted to ban TikTok has changed his mind saying a ban would help TikToks rivals like Facebook and YouTube. As the bill against TikTok gains support the app has asked its American users to speak up for it sending messages telling users to call their representatives. The bill which passed a committee last week is expected to be approved when the House votes on Wednesday. If it passes it will then go to the Senate and then the bill will be signed by the President of the US.Former Activision boss reportedly wants to buy TikTokAbout the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

      "Why Earth Sciences minister Rijiju is upset with this European IT companyTOI Tech Desk  TIMESOFINDIA.COM  Updated Mar 11 2024 1439 ISTShareAAText SizeSmallMediumLargeFollow us  PTI photo Earth Sciences Minister Kiren Rijiju is reportedly upset with the French IT company Atos. Reason is said to be delay in the delivery of two supercomputers by the French company to Indian weather forecasting institutes. According to a report in news agency PTI the Earth Sciences Ministry had ordered two supercomputers worth 100 million from French firm Eviden of the Atos Group last year to enhance the computing capabilities of its institutions  the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting NCMRWF and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology IITM.I am more upset because the target we set was December. The Union Cabinet had already approved purchasing the supercomputer. We have only four petaflop capacity. We want to install up to 18 petaflop capacity Rijiju told PTI in a video interview.He said that the French company ran into some financial trouble and wanted the government to make payment to its subsidiary.Minister says that the delay is causing him worryRijiju said that the delay has caused him lots of worry as the company has overshot the timeline. But I think we will sort it out soon he said adding that the government wanted to be very correct in our position legally.We are ready to release the money because we want the machine immediately. The only problem is the amount is not small. So if we pay now if the company is bankrupt or something happens who will bail out the minister said.Rijiju further added that the government was taking some steps to speed up the delivery of the supercomputer but did not elaborate. But I hope the French government will also intervene because we have a good understanding and a very good relationship with the French government.Since it is a highcost equipment we want to ensure that the transaction happens duly and properly he said.From outside everythings ready. It is only the problem with the main company. They want us to pay their subsidiary. We will pay only to a company whom we have entered an MoU with Rijiju said.The supercomputing system based on Evidens BullSequana XH2000 is said to have a combined power capacity of up to 21.3 petaflops.Supercomputer at IITMThe supercomputer at the Punebased IITM will provide 13 petaflops of computing power for atmosphere and climate research. As per the PTI report it will integrate 3000 CPU nodes using AMD EPYC 7643 processors and 26 GPU nodes through NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. The system will benefit from the NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand networking platform with InNetwork Computing 3PB all flash and 29PB diskbased DDN EXAScaler ES400NVX2 storage and Micron hightechnology memory.The existing computing facility at NCMRWF is 2.8 petaflops and at IITM is 4 petaflops respectively.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

      "The Bar Council of India has imposed a threeyear moratorium on new law colleges due to concerns about declining educational standards and an oversupply of graduates. This pause aims to allow for audits stricter regulations and curriculum reforms to improve the quality of legal education. Exceptions may be considered for underserved regions signalling a calibrated approach to address systemic issues. Law College Dreams A Bright Future The Bar Council of India BCI the statutory body that regulates legal education and practice has recently imposed a threeyear moratorium on the establishment of new law colleges and centres of legal education CLEs. Indias legal education has long resembled an overcrowded courtroom Too many petitioners too few advocates of substance and an avalanche of paper that often hides the paucity of substance. At first glance the decision may appear draconian in a country with soaring demand for legal education. But scratch beneath the surface and the move reflects a deeper crisis in Indias legal training ecosystemone that regulators are keen to fix before allowing further expansion.The problem of quantity over qualityEstimates suggest that India today has over 1700 law colleges producing approximately 8000090000 graduates each year. In theory this should be a celebration of democracy of access of justice made tangible through a wider pool of practitioners. In practice the majority of these institutions are barely more than signboards with classrooms. They offer skeletal libraries nonexistent moot courts and faculty that too often treat teaching as a reluctant parttime job.Multiple surveys by the BCI and independent commissions have revealed that a large share of law colleges operate more as degree shops than serious centres of learning. They lack fulltime qualified faculty libraries are skeletal and clinical legal training is almost absent. The result Graduates who hold a degree but are often illprepared for practice in courts corporate firms or public service.Employment mismatch The graduate glutThe crisis is not just academic but also economic. For every clutch of graduates from National Law Universities who step into gleaming corporate boardrooms there are thousands more who wander from chambers to district courts struggling to find cases or worse jobs that match neither their degree nor their debt. The glut of unemployable law graduates has become the professions open secret.The BCI has been repeatedly criticised for allowing proliferation of substandard colleges leading to an oversupply of graduates with limited practical skills. By announcing a freeze the regulator is signalling that it wants to correct the imbalance between supply and demand.Using the pause to raise standardsThe moratorium is also about buying time to implement reforms. During this threeyear window the BCI aims toAudit existing colleges to ensure compliance with infrastructure faculty and curriculum standards.Tighten recognition norms making it harder for institutions to survive without meeting minimum requirements.Push for practical training including moot courts internships and clinical legal education.Align curricula with contemporary needscyber law arbitration AI and lawso that graduates are better prepared for modern practice.In short the BCI wants to ensure that the next expansion of law colleges is accompanied by higher academic rigour and professional credibility rather than unchecked growth.A history of oversight failuresThis is not the first time the legal education sector has been under the scanner. Back in the 1990s the Yash Pal Committee and the National Knowledge Commission flagged concerns about the proliferation of substandard professional collegesin law engineering and management alike. Despite multiple warnings regulatory loopholes allowed a surge of law colleges in semiurban and rural areas many without the means to deliver quality education.The current moratorium is therefore an acknowledgement of past regulatory failures. It reflects the BCIs recognition that before more licences are granted existing institutions must be cleaned up and strengthened.The broader context Lack of trust in the legal systemIndias judiciary is already battling a credibility crisis with innumerable pending cases long delays and concerns about access to justice. In this context poorly trained lawyers only worsen the problem. The moratorium thus serves a symbolic as well as practical purpose Sending a message that legal education cannot be diluted without damaging the very justice system it feeds into.Interestingly the BCI has kept the door slightly ajar. The Council has said that in backward or underserved regions exceptions may be considered if there is a strong case for opening a new institution. This indicates that the moratorium is not an absolute freeze but a carefully calibrated pause.Recent developmentsWhile new colleges are blocked existing institutions are seeing active regulatory engagementCNLUs 3Year LLB Course Chanakya National Law University Patna has been permitted to start a threeyear LLB programme from 202526 making it the fourth NLU to do so. This suggests that the BCI is still encouraging programme diversification within reputed universities.Gujarat Colleges Back in Admissions Fourteen grantinaid law colleges in Gujarat previously excluded for noncompliance have been reinstated into the admission process after the state government cleared dues and promised reforms. They must now strictly follow faculty and infrastructure norms.The road aheadThe moratorium is not merely about stopping new colleges it is about resetting the standards of legal education in India. If the BCI uses these three years to enforce accountability upgrade curricula and weed out nonperforming institutions the longterm benefits could be significant.However if this pause ends without meaningful reform it risks being yet another cosmetic measureleaving students to bear the brunt of a system that churns out degrees without delivering real opportunity.Ready to navigate global policies Secure your overseas future.

Experts recommend revisiting notes within 24 hours to reinforce memory and transforming notes into personal dialogues with questions and insights. Ultimately good notes spark curiosity and deepen understanding making knowledge truly ones own. 7 effective notetaking techniques that genuinely improve comprehension retention and academic performance Image Pexels If there is one essential skill that students should master in schools and universities it is the art of taking good notes. Notes that are not copied and pasted from professors slides not even the ones that we scribble on a notebook and later become difficult to comprehend. The Art of Taking Notes that could not only be understood but also remembered and used later for learning purposes. Effective notetaking is not just recording facts or copying from textbook to note format. Most notebooks are summaries of textbooks that are never looked at or hardly ever. The whole purpose of note taking is that it is something you will revisit and want to revisit it. So many notes are taken but never made use of.A recent 2025 Cornell University study made a comparison of physics courses where students who were trained in notetaking and motivated to use their selfprepared notes performed better in exams than those with no structured notetaking approach. The study highlighted how strategic notetaking boosts engagement and learning outcomes.As Gen Z is a digital generation they are more comfortable using their screens than paper. Those old spiral notebooks and registers have been replaced by laptops iPads and phones. Technology is good and has made life easier but the issue is that taking notes can become a mindless typing process and the notes are often not even revisited. The long audio recordings contain huge amounts of information but the question is are students processing itWriting notes by hand boosts retention and keeps you more engaged than typing. According to a 2020 study Using voice notetaking to promote learners conceptual understanding taking notes via voice input leads to a higher conceptual understanding of the text and encourages more elaborate and comprehensive notes. The researchers found that instead of typing it was voicebased notetaking that prompted deeper processing and richer more comprehensive note generation. This suggests that leveraging speech input can boost conceptual learning in digital environments.The reality is it doesnt matter what medium students are using for taking notes. Effective notetaking is all about what and how one thinks while writing. Great notes do more than capture information they spark thinking. They spark reflection and connection. They help you understand better not just remember facts which you may as well underline in the original text and you will likely recall better as you look at your textbook more often than a note book.Typing may make us less able to recall the very information we were just working with later according to a study published in Psychological Science. Students at Princeton University took notes on a TED Talk where half used laptops and the other half used a pen and paper. The laptopusing group seemed to transcribe the talk instead of ingesting it this was found via testing of both groups later. Each group was tested on what they had learned a week later and the findings revealed that those who wrote in longhand had better memory recall. Here are some effective notetaking techniques by experts. Listen first write laterDont be in a hurry to jot down whatever you are listening to. Dont be that kid who rushes to write everything. In an interview with TOI Dr CP Rashmi Associate Professor Head of the Institute Amity School of Communication at Amity University in Bangalore advised Pause first and concentrate on listening. Listen understand and then write down notes in your own words. Humans remember processed information better than copied information.Use the Cornell methodSplit the page paper or digital screen into three sections. Dr Rashmi suggested Make a narrow column on the lefthand side where you can jot down questions prompts and keywords that will help you summarise your thoughts. The right section will be used for writing notes and the bottom section is where one will write a summary of the notes that would come in handy before exams. This structure of writing notes not only helps one review the notes but also condenses the information. This system enables the 5 Rs of notetaking record reduce recite reflect and review while the process helps transform raw lecture content into clear retained knowledge.Visualise your learningVisual thinking helps in memorising content better. Dr Rashmi opined One can start with the main topic in the centre of the page and then branch out into subtopics and ideas connecting them like flow charts or graphs. The digital generation can also use many freely available apps for the same purpose. These roughly made sketches help you understand learn and see the bigger picture.Pen and paper Your brains best friendTheres something quietly powerful about the oldschool pen and notebook. Dr Rashmi pointed out Writing on paper with a pen slows you down just enough to think about each word giving your brain time to absorb ideas instead of letting them slide past.Sketchnoting boosts focus and visual memory retention Image PexelsPsychologists have found that writing by hand activates areas of the brain linked to memory focus and even creativity. It is meditation for the brain as it calms the mind. While research shows the anxiety that digital media can cause after hours of scrolling writing is almost meditative your mind feels calmer. Dr Rashmi said The act of holding a pen and writing each letter can feel grounding almost like telling your brain This matters. Pay attention and that mental pause is often what turns information into lasting understanding.Use mind mapsAids like mind maps can turn scattered ideas into clear visual networks. They give away links and patterns that straight lists often hide. Dr. Sunita Gandhi Educator Researcher Innovator Author and Founder of Global Education and Training Institute GETI and Dignity Education Vision International DEVI Sansthan explained Restating and better still making a diagram or a mind map or a flow chart or a graphic organiser especially what you have learned in your own words after a lesson makes you actively process the content which helps it stay in your memory and you may end up using it for revision.Make task cardsThe one type of notetaking that is especially useful is a task card. One side is a question or a topic on the other are bullet points formulae or a graphic summarising the answers or the topic. Dr. Gandhi asserted It is better still that they are on the front and back side of a notebook or even on cards an A4 sheet in half or quarters. You can pick it up every evening for 10 minutes read the question or be reminded of a topic you try to recall what might be on the back side then turn over to see if you got it right. You may even attempt a full question in your rough notebook then review if you get it right. Once you know you have mastered a few cards put them in a new pouch like a ziplock bag and revisit them less often say once a month or near an exam.Have conversations with to yourselfAccording to Dr. Gandhi the best notes are the dialogues with yourself. They capture your questions insights and even moments of doubt. This gives them life and personality rather than leaving them as dry passive records.Though there are many more techniques the golden rule that one should always follow is to review the notes within 24 hours. By revisiting the notes on the same day or the next day you reinforce the memory while the information in your brain is still fresh. This process helps in retaining the information for a longer period.Dr Rashmi shared In my 20 years of teaching Ive seen students with average abilities outshine toppers simply because they knew how to take and use their notes well. Good notes arent just an academic tool theyre your personal library of understanding. Whether youre tapping on a tablet or scribbling in a diary remember notetaking isnt about storing words. Its about making the knowledge truly yours.Good notes spark curiosity. They invite you to return review and build on them. A note that is never revisited is a missed opportunity and worse as it is loads of wasted time in making those notes in the first place. The simple act of writing does not take it to long term memory. Rereading at intervals the same day a week later before a test strengthens memory and understanding. What matters is that your notes serve you. They help you connect ideas and deepen understanding and those you keep revisiting and keep learning alive.Ready to navigate global policies Secure your overseas future. Get expert guidance now\n",
