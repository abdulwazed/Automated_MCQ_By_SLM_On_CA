40.Chagas disease, that was recently seen in news, is caused by which agent?
[A] Virus
[B] Bacteria
[C] Fungus
[D] Protozoa
Hide Answer

Correct Answer: D [Protozoa]
Notes:
Recently, concern was raised that despite the huge human and economic toll of Chagas disease, investment in research and development of diagnostics, medicines, and vaccines remains disproportionately low. Chagas disease, or American trypanosomiasis, is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. It spreads mainly through blood-sucking triatomine bugs, also called reduviid or “kissing bugs,” which often bite the face. Infection occurs when parasite-containing feces of the bug enter the body. It can also spread from mother to child, contaminated food or drinks, blood transfusions, organ transplants, or lab accidents. The disease is common in South America, Central America, and Mexico.
