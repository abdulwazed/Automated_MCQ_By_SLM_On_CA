6.Which country has become the first in the world to develop Genome-edited rice varieties?
[A] Japan
[B] China
[C] India
[D] Vietnam
Hide Answer

Correct Answer: C [India]
Notes:
India has become the first country in the world to develop genome-edited rice varieties. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has developed two such varieties named DRR Rice 100 (Kamla) and Pusa DST Rice. These rice varieties were developed using genome editing technology based on Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-CRISPR Associated Protein (CRISPR-Cas). This technology allows precise changes in the genetic material without adding any foreign DNA. Genome editing targeted the Site Directed Nuclease 1 (SDN1) and SDN2 types of genes, which are approved under India’s biosafety rules. The development was supported by the National Agricultural Science Fund (NASF), which funds strategic agricultural research.
7.Which state government has recently launched the “One State, One Registration” scheme to make property registration easy and citizen-friendly?
[A] Bihar
[B] Jharkhand
[C] Maharashtra
[D] Uttar Pradesh
Hide Answer

Correct Answer: C [Maharashtra]
Notes:
The Maharashtra government launched the “One State, One Registration” scheme to make property registration easy and citizen-friendly. It allows people to register property documents at any sub-registrar office in Maharashtra, regardless of where the property is located. Earlier, buyers had to register documents only at the local sub-registrar office of the property, which caused delays and overcrowding. The new policy saves time, reduces paperwork, and helps senior citizens and Non-Resident Indians (NRIs). Legal steps and documents like sale deed, Aadhaar, and PAN remain unchanged. It does not affect stamp duty or registration fees. The National Informatics Centre (NIC) is using technology like Geographic Information System (GIS), drone mapping, and blockchain for better accuracy. This move is expected to boost real estate activity and investor confidence in the state.
