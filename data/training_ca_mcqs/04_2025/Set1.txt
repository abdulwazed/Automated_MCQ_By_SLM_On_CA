[C] Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
[D] Ministry of Women and Child Development
Hide Answer

Correct Answer: D [Ministry of Women and Child Development]
Notes:
The Union Ministry of Women and Child Development (WCD) released a report titled “How Does Climate Change Impact Women and Children Across Agroecological Zones”. The report shows that women and children face a higher risk of death during disasters than men due to existing social roles and responsibilities. It highlights the urgent need for gender-disaggregated data to create better disaster response and climate policies. India has 20 agroecological zones with varied climates, which affect the level of vulnerability differently across regions. States like Jharkhand, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Andhra Pradesh have five agroecosystems each, while zones like the North Eastern Hills (Region 17) and Western Coastal Plains (Region 19) span multiple states. This overlap calls for coordinated climate adaptation strategies across states for better protection of women and children.
