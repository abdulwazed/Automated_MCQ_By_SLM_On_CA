14.According to recent study in Madagascar, which species was identified as the exclusive carrier of the Hantavirus?
[A] Black rat
[B] Fruit bat
[C] Mosquitofish
[D] Bull frog
Hide Answer

Correct Answer: A [Black rat]
Notes:
A study in Madagascar found that hantavirus is carried only by black rats, also called Rattus rattus, in rural areas. These rats came from Asia and were introduced to Madagascar between the 10th and 14th centuries, spreading widely since then. Researchers tested around 2,000 animals, but no native rodents, bats, or other small animals had the virus. Hantavirus is a rare but deadly virus spread by infected rodents. It transmits through contact with rodent urine, feces, or saliva, mainly through air particles or direct contact. Human-to-human spread is extremely rare, so environmental exposure is the key risk.

GaN provides high efficiency, thermal stability, and fast switching speeds, lowering system and operation costs. It powers next-generation 5G and 6G networks, advanced laptops, defence tech, data analytics, and power electronics.
19.A rare golden tiger, also called a golden tabby tiger, was recently spotted at which national park in Assam?
[A] Kaziranga National Park
[B] Manas National Park
[C] Dibru-Saikhowa National Park
[D] Orang National Park
Hide Answer

Correct Answer: A [Kaziranga National Park]
Notes:
A rare golden tiger, also called a golden tabby tiger, was recently spotted in Kaziranga National Park, Assam. It is not a separate subspecies but a colour variant of the Bengal tiger. Only four golden tigers are known to exist in the wild, all in Kaziranga. The colour is due to a mutation in the wideband gene, which increases the reddish-yellow pigment called pheomelanin. Both tiger parents must carry this mutated gene for the golden colour to appear. The colour itself is harmless, but it may result from inbreeding, which can cause genetic weaknesses.

[A] 6.2%
[B] 6.7%

Hide Answer

Correct Answer: B [6.7%]
Notes:
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) in its April 2025 Asian Development Outlook has projected India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 6.7% for fiscal year 2025. This shows India’s economic resilience despite global challenges, driven by strong domestic demand, growth in rural income, and controlled inflation. Reforms like tax cuts for the middle class and monetary easing through repo rate cuts are also boosting the economy. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has slightly lowered its forecast to 6.5%, but ADB remains confident about India’s growth continuing into fiscal year 2026.
