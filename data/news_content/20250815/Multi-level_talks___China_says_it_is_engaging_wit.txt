Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters on Thursday that the two countries are “maintaining interactions at various levels” and are ready to work together on key issues. He added that China is prepared to act on agreements reached between the two countries’ leaders, maintain high-level exchanges, build political trust, strengthen cooperation, and manage differences carefully."We stand ready to work with India to act on the important common understandings reached between leaders of our two countries, maintain the momentum of high-level exchanges, cement political mutual trust, enhance practical cooperation, properly handle differences, and promote the sustained, sound and steady development of China-India ties," Lin said. On questions about Wang Yi’s travel plans, Lin said, “Relevant information will be released in due course.” He described the China-India relationship as a partnership of “immense potential” in the global south and called cooperation between the two countries the “right choice” for both sides. Lin also said China is ready to work with India to increase trust, expand cooperation, handle differences with a broader perspective, and strengthen collaboration on multilateral platforms such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, aiming for steady and sound development of bilateral ties. Meanwhile, India’s ministry of external affairs (MEA) said both countries are working to resume trade through designated border points, including Lipulekh Pass in Uttarakhand, Shipki La Pass in Himachal Pradesh, and Nathu La Pass in Sikkim. The MEA also noted that India and China have restarted talks on border trade through all designated points after a five-year pause.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
