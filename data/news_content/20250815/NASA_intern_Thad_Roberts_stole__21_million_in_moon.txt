Source: LADbible In one of the most audacious and bizarre crimes in NASA history, Thad Roberts, a 24-year-old intern, stole moon rocks valued at $21 million in 2002, driven by romance rather than greed. Alongside his girlfriend Tiffany Fowler and fellow intern Shae Saur, Roberts executed a meticulously planned burglary at Houston’s Johnson Space Center, using authentic NASA badges, rewired security cameras, and Neoprene suits to bypass alarms. Their theft of 17 pounds of lunar samples included historic moon rocks from Apollo missions 1969–1972. While Roberts claimed the act was “for love,” the FBI revealed he had attempted to sell the rocks secretly online. This extraordinary heist destroyed priceless scientific research, embarrassed NASA, and shocked the world, blending science, crime, and obsession in an unforgettable story.$21 million moon rock theft at Johnson Space Center shocks scientists worldwideOn a July night in 2002, Roberts, Fowler, and Saur infiltrated Building 31 at Johnson Space Center. Roberts and Fowler donned Neoprene bodysuits, which allowed them to bypass thermal alarms, while Saur acted as a lookout. Using a power saw, they cracked open a 601-pound safe containing moon rocks and meteorites, including samples from every Apollo mission, many of which were irreplaceable and scientifically invaluable. The stolen lunar samples were worth approximately $21 million and represented decades of scientific research, experimentation, and NASA missions. The planning and execution demonstrated not only audacity but also technical sophistication, showing how a combination of insider knowledge, meticulous preparation, and determination can circumvent the most secure facilities.

From NASA Intern to mastermind behind the $21 million moon rock theftThad Roberts graduated from the University of Utah with a triple degree in physics, geology, and geophysics, making him highly qualified to work at NASA. He met Tiffany Fowler, a 22-year-old stem cell researcher, and the couple quickly became romantically involved. Roberts reportedly told Fowler he wanted to “give her the moon,” framing the theft as a grand romantic gesture. According to People.com , the FBI considered financial motives, Roberts maintained that the act symbolized devotion rather than profit.Moon rock theft ends with FBI arrests and millions in NASA lunar samples lostRoberts and Fowler’s motivation went beyond romance—they symbolically “had sex on the moon” by placing stolen lunar samples under a blanket during intimate moments. Roberts later stated, “No one had ever had sex on the moon before,” underscoring the bizarre, almost surreal nature of the crime. While Roberts claimed love was the driving factor, the FBI discovered he had negotiated with a Belgian buyer willing to pay up to $5,000 per gram, proving the theft had financial implications.The heist came to a dramatic end when Roberts and Fowler traveled to Orlando to meet the potential buyer, only to be apprehended by undercover FBI agents. Saur and Gordon McWhorter, who helped arrange the sale, were arrested shortly afterward. The investigation revealed that the theft had caused irreversible damage: the moon rocks were now “virtually useless to the scientific community,” and three decades of NASA research notes were destroyed as reported.Moon rock theft from NASA leads to jail, house arrest, and finesThad Roberts pleaded guilty to the theft of moon rocks and other NASA artifacts, serving over six years of an eight-year prison sentence before his release in 2008. Tiffany Fowler and Shae Saur received house arrest, community service, and were required to pay restitution to NASA. Gordon McWhorter was convicted at trial for his involvement in the theft and sentenced to six years in prison. The case highlighted serious security breaches and led to stricter controls on NASA’s valuable collections.Also Read | NASA and Google collaborating together to boost astronaut health on Moon and Mars missionsAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.
