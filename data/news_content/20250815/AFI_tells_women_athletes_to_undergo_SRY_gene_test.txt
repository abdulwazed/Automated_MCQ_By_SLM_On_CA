Representational Image of a Track field. Bengaluru: With the World Athletics Council approving new regulations for athletes to compete in the women’s category for world ranking competitions, the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) has informed top athletes and coaches that all female athletes who make the grade should undergo ‘SRY gene test’ to be eligible to compete in next month’s World Championships to be held in Tokyo. “All female athletes who meet the qualification standards for the World Athletics Championships should undergo the SRY gene test in consultation with the Athletics Federation of India,” AFI said in a communication to the athletes and coaches. “All concerned are requested to ensure compliance with the above requirement at the earliest, failing which the concerned athlete shall not be permitted to compete in the female category,” Shailesh Kumar, chairman of AFI’s medical commission, said in the letter.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

AFI sources told TOI that as the final list of Indian women athletes who will qualify will be known only at the end of the qualifying period on Aug 24, the tests will be ongoing, starting with those who have already made the grade or who are on the verge of making the cut. “All athletes have been informed about the requirement and most of these samples will be tested at the National Dope Testing Laboratory (NDTL) in New Delhi,” they said. Asked if the samples would be sent abroad, the sources said NDTL is equipped to conduct the required tests. While Parul Chaudhary (3000m steeplechase) and Priyanka (35km race walk) have made the cut, Annu Rani (javelin throw) has more or less confirmed her berth through the world ranking quota. Another five athletes — Ankita (3000m steeplechase), Seema (10,000m), Shaili Singh (long jump), Vithya Ramraj (400m hurdles) and Pooja (high jump) — have kept their hopes alive and will look to give their best in the Inter-State meet beginning in Chennai on Aug 20. World Athletics announced the new test on July 30 and said the new regulations will come into effect on Sept 1, 2025 and will be applied to the Worlds that begin on Sept 13. “All athletes wishing to compete in the female category at the World Championships are required to undergo a once-in-a-lifetime test for the SRY gene — a reliable proxy for determining biological sex,” the world body had said.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
