Tricolours are already visible across the country—in shops, streets, and markets—dominating clothing and everyday items. This year’s celebrations carry the theme ‘Naya Bharat,’ reflecting the government’s vision of achieving ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047.Upon arrival at the Red Fort, PM Modi will be received by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, MoS Defence Sanjay Seth, and Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, who will introduce Lieutenant General Bhavnish Kumar, General Officer Commanding (GOC), Delhi area, to the Prime Minister.The success of Operation Sindoor will also be celebrated during this year’s Independence Day functions. The view cutter at Gyanpath will display the Operation Sindoor logo, complemented by floral arrangements themed around the operation. Flying Officer Rashika Sharma will assist PM Modi in hoisting the flag, after which flower petals will be showered from two Mi-17 helicopters—one carrying the national flag and the other the Operation Sindoor flag. The aircraft will be piloted by Wing Commander Vinay Poonia and Wing Commander Aditya Jaiswal.After the flag-hoisting ceremony, the Prime Minister will address the nation. NCC cadets and ‘My Bharat’ volunteers will then sing the National Anthem. A total of 2,500 cadets from the Army, Navy, and Air Force, along with volunteers, will be seated on Gyanpath opposite the Rampart, forming the ‘Naya Bharat’ logo.Around 5,000 special guests from various walks of life will witness the celebrations, including the Indian contingent of Special Olympics 2025, winners of international sports events, Gold Medalists of Khelo India Para Games, and the best-performing farmers under the National Beekeeping and Honey Mission. Other invitees include top-performing farmers, traders, Sarpanches, young authors under PM YUVA, entrepreneurs under schemes like PM Van Dhan Yojana, SC/ST Hub, and NSTFDC, as well as beneficiaries of PM-DAKSH, SHREYAS, SHRESTA, VISVAS, PM Internship, PM Awaas Yojana Gramin, and My Bharat Volunteers.To promote patriotic fervour and celebrate Operation Sindoor, band performances will take place across the country on Independence Day evening for the first time. Bands from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Indian Coast Guard, NCC, CRPF, ITBP, CISF, SSB, BSF, IDS, RPF, and Assam Rifles will perform at over 140 prominent locations nationwide.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7 as a decisive military response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed 26 lives. The Indian Armed Forces targeted terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, eliminating over 100 terrorists. The government also sent seven multi-party delegations abroad to present India’s stand against cross-border terrorism.The Har Ghar Tiranga Abhiyan, launched at the Prime Minister’s call, has inspired citizens with a patriotic spirit. Under the Ministry of Culture, the 4th edition of this campaign was announced on August 11 as part of ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’, encouraging citizens to bring the Tiranga into their homes and hearts.Union Minister for Culture and Tourism Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said, "This year, we are going to celebrate the fourth edition of the Tiranga campaign, for which more than 5 lakh youths have registered as volunteers. These youths will inspire people for the Tiranga campaign."The Ministry of Culture is the nodal body for the campaign and is working closely with State Governments, Union Territories, educational institutions, community organisations, and the public to ensure widespread participation. Citizens are encouraged to hoist the Tiranga at homes, offices, and public spaces and share their celebrations online using the hashtag #HarGharTiranga.The campaign builds on the success of previous editions, encouraging personal and community engagement with the national flag. This year, the celebrations unfolded in phases, culminating on August 15, with a unified display of the Tiranga nationwide, symbolising a collective affirmation of national pride.The campaign’s strength lies in a whole-of-society approach, bringing together ministries, States, Union Territories, and citizens in a unified effort, ensuring the celebrations reach every part of the country and resonate with people from all walks of life.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
