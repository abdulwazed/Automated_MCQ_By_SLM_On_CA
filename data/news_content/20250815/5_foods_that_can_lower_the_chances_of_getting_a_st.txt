Your brain are unable to get oxygen and nutrients they need from blood, and start to die within a few minutes. This can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death. Stroke can be caused by a variety of factors including High Blood Pressure, smoking, diabetes, and poor diet. However, certain foods provide cardiovascular benefits which help decrease blood pressure while fighting inflammation. The following five foods can decrease your chances of experiencing a stroke.... Take a look...2/6Leafy green vegetablesLeafy greens consisting of spinach, kale, collard greens etc provide brain and heart protection through their essential nutritional value. Your body transforms dietary nitrates from leafy greens into the beneficial compound nitric oxide. The production of nitric oxide results in blood vessel relaxation and expansion, which enhances blood flow while decreasing blood pressure levels. Stroke prevention becomes more likely through the consumption of leafy greens because high blood pressure remains a significant risk factor for stroke. The nutritional elements in these vegetables help protect blood vessels through their vitamin content and antioxidant properties, which fight dangerous molecules in the body. A person who consumes one cup of leafy greens each day will experience decreased chances of developing ischemic stroke, that occurs because of clots obstructing brain blood flow.3/6Walnuts and other nutsThe heart and brain benefits of walnuts, stem from their content of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) which belongs to the omega-3 fatty acid family. Omega-3s in the body create anti-inflammatory effects, which enhance blood circulation and decrease blood pressure levels to minimise stroke occurrence. Walnuts contain protective antioxidants which shield the body from oxidative stress, by protecting its cells and blood vessels. Scientific research indicates walnuts consumed on a regular basis, help decrease both heart disease and stroke risks. Daily consumption of a handful of walnuts along with almonds and flaxseeds, maintains your vascular system.4/6Citrus fruitsVitamin C along with potassium and flavonoids from citrus fruits like oranges, grapefruits and lemons, provide antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The nutrients in these foods work to preserve healthy blood vessels while decreasing inflammation, which leads to damage and blockages. Studies prove that eating citrus fruits regularly decreases stroke risk through improved blood vessel function, together with lowered blood pressure. Eating different citrus fruits each day through natural juice consumption provides these health benefits.5/6Fatty FishSalmon, mackerel, trout and fresh tuna among other fatty fish varieties are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. The healthy fats in these foods decrease blood pressure, while simultaneously fighting inflammation and improving cholesterol numbers through increased good HDL cholesterol and decreased bad LDL cholesterol. These beneficial outcomes decrease the probability of blood clots that block brain blood flow. Medical professionals advise patients to consume fatty fish twice to three times weekly, to prevent stroke. You can prepare these fish by grilling or baking them, and using them in salads and pasta dishes.6/6Yogurt and low-fat dairy productsYogurt, alongside other low-fat dairy products supply the body with calcium, potassium, protein and vitamin D. The body maintains healthy blood pressure through potassium, which regulates sodium levels. Healthy blood vessels together with strong bones, receive support from calcium and vitamin D. Selecting low-fat or non-fat dairy alternatives instead of full-fat versions, enables people to minimise their intake of saturated fat and cholesterol, which can negatively impact heart health. Research indicates that regular yogurt consumption leads to lower probabilities of developing stroke and heart disease. Yogurt serves as a snack that can be combined with fresh fruit and whole grains during breakfast time.Sourceshttps://www.healthline.com/health/stroke/foods-that-prevent-strokehttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6047334/https://continentalhospitals.com/blog/10-foods-to-add-to-your-diet-that-help-prevent-stroke/https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/8-things-you-can-do-to-prevent-a-strokehttps://www.geisinger.org/health-and-wellness/wellness-articles/2018/05/08/13/47/these-brain-foods-could-cut-your-risk-of-strokeDisclaimer: This article is informational only and not a substitute for medical adviceFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous10 must-try South Indian Paneer dishesFood5 early signs that one's nervous system is breaking downindiaSonnalli Seygall radiates elegance in a graceful saree look that turns headsindiaIn pic: Radiant pictures of Pooja Hegdeindia5 human body parts we may no longer need in the futureindia10 Stunning ethnic looks of Megha ShettyindiaBollywood-approved ethnic sets that are perfect for Independence Day 2025india10 celeb-inspired Indian baby girl namesindiaIndependence Day 2025: 10 inspiring lines on Freedom that warm the heartindia Next123 Photostories  Countries that also celebrate Independence Day on August 15105+ Happy Independence Day messages, greetings, wishes and quotes for 20255 reasons why most Gen-Z travellers in India are opting for offbeat getaways5 unique and must-have desserts made with eggsFrom forest to ice: 6 animals that vanish into their habitatDid you know Sameera Reddy was the first Indian actress to have her own video game?Freedom Trails: Cities where India’s independence was forgedFAFO parenting: 7 facts about the new parenting trendIndependence Day special: This Indian floral fabric threatened Europe’s textile industry123lifestyle videos13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement16:34Life After 60: Why India's seniors are choosing community living04:34Control Your Senses, Gain Knowledge, Attain Peace: Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4.3906:37Cultural Clashes in Love: How To Make Your Relationship Work03:19Prayagraj MahaKumbh 2025 Readies For Millions: Massive Preparations Underway In Uttar Pradesh04:48Sadhguru Reveals The Truth About Black Magic And Your Photograph07:18BK Shivani On Forgiveness: Why It’s Essential For Inner Peace08:08How Bhairavi Sadhana Accelerates Your Path to Liberation: Sadhguru Speaks06:47Breakup Recovery: How To Not Wallow In Misery And Love Yourself03:20The Purifying Power of Yajna: Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4, Verse 3011:41How Dattatreya Accepted Parashuram as His Disciple – Sadhguru Reveals03:54Can Water Remember?
