A recent study highlights the significant benefits of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables for individuals with hypertension. The research demonstrates that incorporating more fruits and vegetables into one's diet can effectively lower blood pressure, improve kidney health, and reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Unlike sodium bicarbonate, fruits and vegetables achieve these benefits while potentially reducing the need for medication. High blood pressure, aka hypertension, affects about 1.28 billion adults (aged 30–79) globally. Among these, about 46% are unaware that this condition exists, according to the WHO. High blood pressure is a silent killer and could lead to chronic illnesses, such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Certain factors increase the risk of hypertension; however, some of them are in our control, and one is diet. A 2024 study found that making certain dietary changes can lower blood pressure and improve kidney and heart health. The findings of the five-year interventional randomized control trial are published in The American Journal of Medicine. Watch what you eatFocusing on a diet that is rich in fruits and vegetables is crucial in the treatment of hypertension patients, according to doctors. Despite efforts, hypertension-related chronic kidney disease and its cardiovascular mortality are increasing. Heart disease is the number one reason that patients with chronic kidney disease die.PollWhich factor do you think has the most significant impact on managing high blood pressure?Healthy diet (fruits & vegetables)MedicationSo what should you eat to lower blood pressure? DASH. Yes, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, is proven to lower blood pressure. This is a flexible and balanced eating plan, that is rich in fruits and vegetables. It is the recommended first-line treatment for primary hypertension. Despite scientific evidence, the DASH diet is under-prescribed and under-implemented.“As a nephrologist (kidney doctor), my acid-base laboratory studies ways by which the kidney removes acid from the blood and puts it into the urine. Our animal studies showed years ago that mechanisms used by the kidneys to remove acid from the blood can cause kidney injury if the animals were chronically (long-term) exposed to an acid-producing diet. Our patient studies showed similar findings: that is, an acid-producing diet (one high in animal products) was kidney-harmful, and one that is base-producing (one high in fruits and vegetables) is kidney-healthy. Other investigators showed that a diet high in fruits and vegetables is heart-healthy. We hypothesized that one way that fruits and vegetables are both kidney- and heart-healthy is that they reduce the amount of acid in the diet and therefore the amount of acid that kidneys have to remove from the body,” Donald E. Wesson, MD, MBA, lead investigator Department of Internal Medicine, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, said, in a statement.The study To test the hypothesis, they conducted a study with participants who had hypertension, but not diabetes, and very high levels of urine albumin excretion (macroalbuminuria). Those with macroalbuminuria have chronic kidney disease, a high risk for the worsening of their kidney disease with time, and a high risk to subsequently developing cardiovascular diseases. The trial took over a five-year period, where the 153 participants with hypertension were divided into three groups:Study participants added 2-4 cups of base-producing fruits and vegetables in addition to their usual daily food intakeStudy participants were prescribed NaHCO3 (acid-reducing sodium bicarbonate, which is common baking soda) tablets in two daily doses of 4-5 650 mg tabletsStudy participants receiving standard medical care from primary care cliniciansHow diet plays a crucial roleThe findings of the study confirmed that consumption of fruits and vegetables and NaHCO3 improved kidney health, but only fruits and vegetables, and not NaHCO3, reduced blood pressure and improved indices of cardiovascular disease risk.“Importantly, fruits and vegetables achieved the latter two benefits with lower doses of medication used to lower blood pressure and reduce cardiovascular disease risk. This means that one can get the kidney health benefits with either fruits and vegetables or NaHCO3, but we get the blood pressure reduction and reduced cardiovascular disease risk with fruits and vegetables, but not with NaHCO3. This supports our recommendation that fruits and vegetables should be ‘foundational’ treatment for patients with hypertension, because we accomplish all three goals (kidney health, lower blood pressure, and reduced cardiovascular disease risk) with fruits and vegetables, and we can do so with lower medication doses,” co-investigator Maninder Kahlon, PhD, Department of Population Health, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, explains.Low blood pressure got you down?

Nevertheless, they are effective, and in this instance, kidney and cardiovascular protective. We must increase our efforts to incorporate them into patient management and more broadly, make healthy diets more accessible to populations at increased risk for kidney and cardiovascular disease,” Dr. Wesson adds.Get the latest lifestyle updates on Times of India, along with Happy Independence Day wishes, messages, and quotes !About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.
