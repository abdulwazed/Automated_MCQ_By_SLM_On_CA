Arjun Tendulkar with father and cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar (Image: Instagram) In India, where cricket often feels like a second religion, a name like Tendulkar carries expectations that are hard to escape. Born on September 24, 1999, to Sachin Tendulkar, one of the game’s most celebrated figures, Arjun Tendulkar has grown up in the public eye. His journey so far has been a mix of steady steps in education, a developing cricket career, and most recently, a new chapter in his personal life—his engagement to Saaniya Chandok, granddaughter of Mumbai businessman Ravi Ghai.Schooling and academic base Arjun began his education at the Dhirubhai Ambani International School in Mumbai, an institution known for its rigorous academics and well-rounded approach to student development. There, he built the foundations of his education while also pursuing cricket. Balancing both academics and sport, he went on to complete his graduation from Mumbai University, signalling that studies remained part of his plan even as cricket took centre stage.Early steps in cricketArjun’s cricketing journey started in Mumbai’s junior teams, where he began to pick up match experience and develop his skills. The first significant milestone came in 2018, when he made his under-19 debut for India against Sri Lanka. On January 15, 2021, he played his first T20 match for Mumbai in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy against Haryana, taking one wicket for 34 runs in his three overs.IPL entry and challengesAhead of the 2021 Indian Premier League season, Mumbai Indians brought Arjun into their squad at the player auction. He was first picked in Mumbai’s senior Syed Mushtaq Ali squad on January 2, 2021. In late September 2021, he was ruled out of the 2021 IPL due to injury, delaying his chance to make an impact. The Mumbai Indians signed him again in February 2022, reflecting continued interest in his potential, even if opportunities remained limited.A move to Goa and first-class cricketIn August 2022, Arjun took the decision to leave Mumbai cricket and join Goa for the domestic season, a shift aimed at securing more playing time and responsibility. Representing Goa in the 2022–23 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and Ranji Trophy, he made his first-class debut on December 13, 2022, against Rajasthan. Batting in the first innings, he scored 120 runs off 207 balls—his maiden century in first-class cricket. The innings was a highlight in his career so far and offered a glimpse of his potential in longer formats.IPL debut and first wicketOn April 16, 2023, Arjun made his IPL debut for Mumbai Indians against Kolkata Knight Riders. Shortly afterwards, in a match against Sunrisers Hyderabad, he claimed his first IPL wicket by dismissing Bhuvneshwar Kumar. These moments, though modest in the larger scheme of the tournament, marked personal milestones in his progression as a player.A career still in progressArjun Tendulkar’s cricketing record so far may not yet match the weight of his surname, but his journey reflects a willingness to take calculated steps—shifting teams, adjusting focus, and balancing education with sport. Off the field, his recent engagement marks a new phase in his personal life. On the field, his career remains a work in progress, with each season offering another opportunity to define himself on his own terms.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future.
