Sidharth Malhotra and Janhvi Kapoor's 'Param Sundari' has generated quite a buzz with its soothing soundtrack and mesmerizing sequences after the makers dropped the first trailer and songs.

A Christian group has demanded the removal of a scene from the film, as it would hurt the Catholic sentiments.Here's what happened.'Param Sundari' in trouble over flirty church scene; Christian group demands removalAccording to a Mid-Day report, a Christian group named Watchdog Foundation has slammed the makers of 'Param Sundari' for showing a romantic, flirty scene in the film. Reportedly, the group has demanded in writing that the scene be taken out of the movie.The report further stated that the group has written to the Mumbai Police, the Central Board of Film Certification, the Information and Broadcasting Ministry, and the Maharashtra government demanding the same. It wants the scene to be removed not just from the movie but also from the promotional videos, trailer, and songs.The lawyer of the Watchdog Foundation told the publication, "The CBFC, established under the Cinematograph Act, 1952, is entrusted with certifying films while taking into account both artistic expression and respect for religious feelings."In the letter, the group mentioned that the church is a sacred place of worship for all the Christians, and showing "indecent content" at such a place would offend the community. The letter read, "This portrayal not only disrespects the spiritual sanctity of the religious place of worship but also deeply offends the sensibilities of the Catholic community."Group questions CBFC and demands FIRThe group questioned how the scene was cleared by the CBFC and warned against protesting the film if it's not dropped from the film. Not just that, they also demanded an FIR to be registered against the producer, director, and actors for hurting the Catholic community.More about 'Param Sundari'The film directed by Tushar Jalota is backed by Dinesh Vijan's production house.
