CBSE clarified such operators are unauthorised and urged reliance only on its official website, stressing it will not be liable for losses from third-party dealings.  The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has issued a public advisory cautioning students, parents, and educational stakeholders about fraudulent operators promising quick solutions for duplicate mark sheets, certificates, and corrections in official records.According to the CBSE Regional Office, Delhi (East), certain individuals and platforms are spreading “misleading and unauthentic claims” of facilitating these services. The Board has categorically denied any association with such agents.“Relying on these unofficial channels may lead to misinformation, financial loss, or other serious consequences,” the CBSE stated, urging people to remain alert and avoid engaging with such entities.Only official portal recognised for document servicesThe Board stressed that legitimate procedures for obtaining duplicate documents, making corrections, or availing other examination-related services are available exclusively through its official website — www.cbse.gov.in.In its advisory, the CBSE made it clear that it will not be held responsible for any loss, dispute, or inconvenience caused by transactions with unauthorised intermediaries.Public interest advisory to curb scamsThe CBSE underlined that the advisory was issued in the public interest to safeguard students and parents from falling victim to fraudulent claims. The warning follows increasing reports of scams in which vulnerable families, desperate for urgent documentation, were lured by false promises of faster service.By reiterating the need for verification and compliance with official procedures, the Board aims to curb the exploitation of students and their families by unverified sources.Ready to navigate global policies?
