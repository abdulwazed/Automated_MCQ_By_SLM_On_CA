NASA shares thrilling update on the mysterious interstellar object racing through our solar system
NASA's Hubble has spotted 3I/ATLAS, the fastest interstellar object ever, zooming through our solar system at 130,000 mph. Though smaller than initially thought, it remains the largest interstellar visitor known. Confirmed as a comet with a glowing tail, 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be twice as old as our solar system, offering a glimpse into the early universe.

Though smaller than initially thought, it remains the largest interstellar visitor known. Confirmed as a comet with a glowing tail, 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be twice as old as our solar system, offering a glimpse into the early universe.  NASA has revealed exciting new information about a mysterious interstellar object called 3I/ATLAS, speeding through our solar system at extraordinary velocities. First detected on July 1, this visitor from beyond our star system has fascinated scientists globally with its astonishing speed of 130,000 miles per hour and intriguing characteristics. Recent observations from the Hubble Space Telescope have captured the clearest images to date, offering key insights into its size, makeup, and path. These discoveries represent a significant advancement in our understanding of these rare travelers crossing the galaxy into our cosmic neighborhood.NASA confirms 3I/ATLAS as the fastest interstellar object ever detectedNASA’s Hubble Space Telescope observations have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is travelling through our solar system at an extraordinary speed of 130,000 miles per hour (209,000 km/h), making it the fastest interstellar object ever recorded. This speed far exceeds that of previous interstellar visitors such as ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. Scientists explain that the object’s velocity is the result of billions of years of gravitational interactions, known as the “gravitational slingshot effect,” where passing stars, planets, and nebulae impart additional momentum to the comet. This extreme speed means the object is only briefly visible as it races through, providing a fleeting window of opportunity for study. NASA’s continuous monitoring aims to capture as much data as possible during its swift passage.Image: Daily MailSize estimates refined: NASA reveals 3I/ATLAS is smaller but still immenseInitial observations by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory suggested that 3I/ATLAS’s icy core might be around seven miles (11.2 km) wide. However, NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has now refined these estimates, revealing that the core is smaller — at most 3.5 miles (5.6 km) across, and possibly as little as 1,000 feet (320 meters) in diameter. Despite being smaller than first believed, this still makes 3I/ATLAS the largest interstellar object ever discovered, dwarfing the next largest known visitor by up to 14 times. The high-resolution images also highlight the comet’s glowing gas halo, which had made it appear larger in earlier, less detailed observations. Understanding the true size helps scientists model its composition and behavior as it interacts with solar radiation.NASA confirms 3I/ATLAS’s cometary nature and its spectacular glowing tailThanks to NASA’s powerful telescopes, scientists have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is not a solid rock but a comet — a chunk of ice, frozen gases, and dust surrounded by a halo of evaporating material. The Hubble images reveal a dust plume streaming from the side of the comet heated by the Sun, along with a faint tail trailing behind it. This tail is formed as the comet’s surface warms up, causing ice to vaporize and release gas and dust into space, creating the characteristic glowing appearance. This phenomenon is similar to that seen in comets within our solar system, but 3I/ATLAS’s interstellar origin and extreme speed make it a rare and valuable subject for study. NASA expects the tail and dust plume to become more pronounced as the object approaches its closest point to the Sun. Scientists hope continued observation will shed light on the comet’s chemical composition, helping reveal clues about its interstellar origins.Ancient traveler: NASA estimates 3I/ATLAS is twice as old as our solar systemOne of the most astonishing revelations from NASA’s studies is the estimated age of 3I/ATLAS. Scientific analysis suggests this object has been orbiting the Milky Way for at least eight billion years — roughly twice the age of our own 4.6 billion-year-old solar system. This implies 3I/ATLAS formed long before our Sun and planets came into existence, making it a true cosmic relic. Its journey through the galaxy has likely included multiple gravitational encounters with stars and interstellar clouds, which may have shaped its trajectory and speed. Studying such an ancient object offers scientists a unique glimpse into the conditions and materials present in the early universe and helps refine models of galactic evolution. Its fleeting passage is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to study a messenger from the galaxy’s distant past.Safe passage confirmed by NASA: No threat to EarthDespite its immense speed and close approach to the Sun, NASA has assured the public that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth. The comet will reach its closest point to the Sun in late October, passing just inside the orbit of Mars at about 130 million miles (210 million kilometers). Crucially, it will be on the opposite side of the Sun relative to Earth during this time, ensuring no risk of collision or gravitational disturbance. NASA continues to monitor the comet’s trajectory precisely, as the interaction with the Sun’s heat may slightly alter its path. After passing the Sun, 3I/ATLAS will head back out into interstellar space, continuing its long journey through the galaxy. This may be humanity’s only chance to witness this ancient traveler before it disappears forever into the cosmic void. Its fleeting visit serves as a reminder of the vast, mysterious, and ever-changing nature of our universe.A new era of discovery: NASA leads the charge in interstellar object research3I/ATLAS marks only the third confirmed interstellar object ever detected, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. NASA’s advancements in telescope technology, sky surveys, and space observatories like Hubble have ushered in a new era of interstellar discovery. Researchers expect that as survey instruments become more sensitive and comprehensive, the frequency of detecting such visitors will increase. NASA plans to utilize not only Hubble but also the James Webb Space Telescope, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory to study 3I/ATLAS in multiple wavelengths. This will allow scientists to capture unprecedented data on the object's composition and interaction with the solar environment. These coordinated observations are crucial for building a more complete picture of interstellar objects and their origins. This coordinated effort will deepen our understanding of the composition, origin, and behavior of interstellar objects and their role in the cosmic ecosystem.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.
