Vladimir Putin emphasized the strategic partnership between the two nations and expressed eagerness to broaden bilateral cooperation. This message arrives amidst US tariff threats and geopolitical tensions, highlighting the enduring bond between Russia and India.  NEW DELHI: India's trusted friend, Russia, on Friday greeted President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Independence Day. The Russian embassy in India, in an official statement, said that Vladimir Putin sent greetings to Murmu and PM Modi, while acknowledging New Delhi's "widely recognised success in socio-economic, scientific, technical, and other fields." Releasing the official statement on its official Telegram channel, the Russian embassy shared Putin's message in which he said India enjoys well-deserved respect on the global stage and actively contributes to addressing key issues."India has achieved widely recognised success in socio-economic, scientific, technical, and other fields. Your country enjoys well-deserved respect on the global stage and actively contributes to addressing key issues on the international agenda," the message reads.Russia's greetings to India came at a crucial time when US President Donald Trump's tariff threats are looming over both countries. Trump announced 25 per cent penalty charges on India for its oil with Russia; meanwhile, he is trying to corner Moscow over its war against Ukraine. Putin continued that Russia highly value the strategic partnership between the two countries and expressed willingness to expand "constructive bilateral cooperation across multiple areas.""We highly value our special, privileged strategic partnership with India. I am confident that, through our joint efforts, we will continue to expand constructive bilateral cooperation across multiple areas. This aligns fully with the interests of our friendly peoples and supports the strengthening of security and stability both regionally and globally," the statement added.

He addressed farmers' interests amid tariff disputes and advocated for 'Swadeshi' products, urging national unity and development. PM Modi at Red Fort NEW DELHI: For the 12th consecutive time on Friday, from the ramparts of the Red Fort, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the nation with his longest 103-minute Independence Day speech.As he delivered the speech, the Prime Minister ensured he touched on every key aspect that has an overwhelming bearing on India's growth trajectory and its unrelentless pursuit of an ambitious future.The Prime Minister delivered a message to India and the world on prevailing challenges, emerging uncertainties, possible solutions, and the dream that Bharat envisions to realise by 2047, when India turns 100."My beloved citizens of India, this festival of independence is a festival of 140 crore resolutions. It is a moment of collective achievements, filled with pride and joy. The nation is continuously strengthening the spirit of unity. Today, 140 crore citizens are immersed in the colours of the Tiranga," PM Modi said at the commencement of his speech.Here are the top 10 messages from PM Modi's speechOn Operation SindoorRecalling the horrors of the massacre that took place at Baisaran meadow in Pahalgam on April 22, PM Modi said that Operation Sindoor carried out in retaliation was "an expression of anger"."Today, I'm witnessing a special significance on 15th August. I am proud that today, I got the opportunity to salute the brave soldiers of Operation Sindoor from the Red Fort. Our brave soldiers gave the enemies a fitting reply, beyond their imagination. Every Indian was angered by the horrors perpetrated by terrorists in Pahalgam. Operation Sindoor is the expression of that very anger," he said.PM said Pakistan still experiences trouble sleeping after Operation Sindoor, as the scale of destruction was so massive. "We gave our Armed Forces a free hand, allowing them to strategise, set the target, and decide the timing. Our forces set a precedent unseen for many decades. They attacked hundreds of kilometres into enemy territory and turned terrorist headquarters to dust. Pakistan’s sleep is still disturbed; the scale of destruction was immense," he said.On PakistanPM Modi reiterated in no uncertain terms that India, which has long been a victim of terrorism, would not differentiate between terrorists and those who shelter them, an indirect but pointed message to Islamabad.The Prime Minister also rebuffed the Pakistani army chief, who is de facto the ruler of the nuclear-armed nation, over a nuclear remark. PM said India would "no longer tolerate nuclear blackmail"."Our country has been bearing the pain of terrorism for many decades. We have now set a new normal. Terrorists and those who shelter them will not be seen separately. They are an equal danger to humanity with no difference. India will no longer tolerate nuclear blackmail. If the enemy dares to commit any more misadventure, the Indian Armed Forces will give them a befitting reply," PM Modi said. On the Indus Water TreatyPrime Minister Narendra Modi said India has decided that blood and water will not flow together and that India's share of water belongs to its farmers."The rivers of India were irrigating the enemy country while our own farmers were deprived of water. Now, the right over India’s share of water belongs only to India and its farmers. A compromise on farmers’ interests and national interests is not acceptable to us. Not anymore," PM Modi said.He further said: "India will absolutely not tolerate the continuation of the Indus Agreement in its current form. In the interest of farmers and the nation, this agreement is unacceptable to us."On Trump's tariffsIn a subtle but conspicuous message, PM Modi said he's standing like a wall in front of any policy that is against the interests of farmers, fishermen, cattle rearers of India," said PM Modi amid tariff row with the US. The United States President Donald Trump has imposed a 50% tariff on India as New Delhi continues to purchase crude oil from Russia."Modi is standing like a wall in front of any policy against the interest of our farmers, fishermen, cattle rearers of India," said PM Modi. "Today India is number one in the world in production of milk, pulses, jute. India is also the second-biggest fish producer. India is also the second-biggest producer of rice, wheat, fruits, vegetables. Export of agro-products worth 4 lakh crore has happened. Many schemes are there to support them. Farmers are becoming courageous with insurance," he added.On DemographyPM Modi said a conspiracy has been hatched to alter the country's demography and that infiltrators are snatching the livelihoods and seizing lands of tribals. "I wish to alert the nation today regarding a concern, a challenge. Under a conspiracy, the country's demography is being altered, sowing the seeds of a new crisis. Infiltrators are snatching the livelihoods of my country's youth, targeting my country's sisters and daughters; this will not be tolerated. These infiltrators are deceiving innocent tribals and seizing their lands; the nation will not endure this," PM Modi said.On NaxalismPM Modi said that areas earlier known as "red corridors" of Naxalism have now become green corridors of development."We know that a large part of our country was badly affected by Naxalism. The greatest loss was suffered by the tribal communities. The lives of young sons were ruined. There was a time when Naxalism had taken deep roots in over 125+ districts. Today, we have brought that number down to 20."He said: "There was a time when the mere mention of Bastar would bring to mind Naxalism, Maoism, and the sound of bombs and guns. Today, Bastar has freed itself from Naxalism and Maoism, and the youth of Bastar are participating in the Olympics". On SwadeshiPM Modi urged shopkeepers and traders to display boards for 'Swadeshi' products, urging citizens to "collectively make the Vocal for Local mantra a part of every citizen’s life"."We have carried out huge reforms in Income Tax laws, some people may have missed it amid din. Past decade was of reform, perform and transform; now we have to focus on greater goals. Want our traders, shopkeepers to display boards for 'Swadeshi' products," said PM Modi.I want to urge all influencers in the country to help me promote this mantra. I say to all political parties and all leaders, let’s come together...this is not the agenda of any political party, India belongs to all of us. Let us collectively make the Vocal for Local mantra a part of every citizen’s life.On India's space ambitionIndia is working towards becoming self-reliant in the space sector, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday. "The nation is proud of our space sector, Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla is back from the space station... in the days to come he will return to India," PM Modi said in his Independence Day address to the nation from the Red Fort.He said India is working on becoming self-reliant in the space sector as well, and is preparing for launch of Gaganyaan. Gaganyaan is India's flagship human spaceflight programme."We will make our own space station," he said.On Rashtriya Swayamsevak SanghPrime Minsiter Narendra Modi hailed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) for completing 100 years of service to the nation, describing it as the "biggest NGO in the world" and praising its century-long contribution to nation-building."Today, I would like to proudly mention that 100 years ago, an organisation was born - Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). 100 years of service to the nation is a proud, golden chapter. With the resolve of 'vyakti nirman se rashtra nirman', with the aim of welfare of Maa Bharati, swayamsevaks dedicated their lives to the welfare of our motherland...In a way, RSS is the biggest NGO of the world. It has a history of 100 years of dedication," PM Modi said.On 1975 EmergencyPM Modi said no generation in the country should forget how democracy was murdered, throttled, and backstabbed during the Emergency. "The Constitution was violated, we were cheated, we were stabbed in the back… India was turned into a prison, and the Emergency was imposed.""It has been 50 years of Emergency. No generation in the country should forget this sin of murdering the Constitution. They should not forget the sinners who murdered the Constitution. We should never forget how democracy was murdered, throttled, and backstabbed during the Emergency," he said.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

"The problem can be solved only by regulating the population of street dogs. But, it cannot be resolved by putting stray dogs in shelters,” he said.According to Shyam Thapa, a Kathmandu-based telecom professional, Nepalese see dogs as sacred and worship the mute canines during the ritual of the Himalayan nation's five-day Kukur Tihar."This unique ritual during Diwali celebrates the beautiful bond between humans and dogs. We urge all Indians to unite against the Supreme Court order and save the stray dogs. Population control & community feeding will help put an end to the so-called problem," he said.In fact, the significance of Kukur Tihar "is deeply rooted in Nepalese mythology", he said. On its second day, pet and stray dogs are honoured with garlands of flowers, given a tika and offered food."Nepalese worship dogs, both strays & pets, as they symbolise loyalty and ultimate protection. But it's heartbreaking to see that a vocal group in India is celebrating the top court's death sentence to strays in Delhi-NCR," said Mohanlal Bhandari, a Kathmandu-based businessman.It may be mentioned here that dogs are also revered in Indian mythology for their loyalty and protective nature. In Mahabharat, for example, Yudhishtir refuses to go to heaven without his faithful dog by his side."Cutting across political and religious lines, all Indians must unite and save the strays. Putting them in pounds will lead to their deaths. And those pounds will eventually become breeding grounds for zoonotic diseases," said Neha Acharya, a Nepali student.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousDivine baby names inspired by Lord KrishnaastrologyAshnoor Kaur’s top 10 ultra-glam lookstvRubina Dilaik's powerful reality show lookstvIn pic: Radiant pictures of Pooja HegdeEntertainment5 human body parts we may no longer need in the futureLifestyleBollywood-approved ethnic sets that are perfect for Independence Day 2025Lifestyle10 Stunning ethnic looks of Megha Shettytv10 celeb-inspired Indian baby girl namesLifestyleOne's own enemy: 8 animals that get triggered by their own reflectionLifestyleIndependence Day 2025: 10 inspiring lines on Freedom that warm the heartLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Independence Day: PM Modi's iconic turban looks at Red Fort since 2014 - In picsBeyond the Crown: Lara Dutta’s surprising life stories9 health benefits of potatoes (backed by science)Janmashtami 2025: 5 diabetes-friendly sweet recipes for Janmashtami bhog50 Years of Thalaivar: Rajinikanth’s iconic movies that fans cherish forever7 workout supplements every fitness enthusiast should know5 simple chia seed recipes that help in weight loss5 foods that can lower the chances of getting a strokeWhy Aarti has 5 flames: The deep meaning behind itIndia at 79: PM Modi leads Independence Day celebrations - In pics123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingLeBron JamesTom BradyDwyane WadeBrock Lesnar Net WorthPlayStation Plus GamesShedeur SanderStefon DiggsJoy TaylorNYU StudentsPatrick MahmoesTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteIndependence Day: 'Made in India' fighter jets to Rs 1 lakh crore youth employment push — 10 major announcements by PM ModiKishtwar cloudburst: PM Modi assures all help to J&K CM Omar Abdullah; death toll rises to 60'Infiltrators snatching bread & butter': PM Modi announces demographic mission on Independence Day - What is it?Sudarshan Chakra Mission: India to develop powerful weapon system; all you need to know about ‘Rashtriya Suraksha Kavach’79th Independence Day: PM Modi delivers longest speech at 103 minutes; breaks previous 98-minute recordIndia at 79: Google Doodle celebrates India's Independence Day - from cricket to cinemaIndependence Day: US extends warm wishes; calls 'historical ties' with India 'consequential and far-reaching'Independence Day 2025: Tiranga, Operation Sindoor banner soar above Red Fort - video‘First job, Rs 15,000 from government’: PM Modi announces Pradhan Mantri Viksit Bharat Rozgar Yojana; unveils scheme in Independence Day speechIndependence Day: PM Modi warns ‘India will not tolerate nuclear threats’; strong message to Pakistan from Red FortIndependence Day 2025 Live Updates: PM Modi calls for indigenous jet engines; pitches for ‘Made in India’ fighter jetsPM Modi announces ₹99,446 crore PM-VBRY scheme, how it will boost the job sectorLeBron James’ wife Savannah James revealed that their love story might have ended if he hadn’t made a crucial career moveRussell Wilson's wife Ciara becomes first descendants of enslaved Africans to receive Benin citizenship under historic new lawJamie Dimon on US-China technology arms race: It’s a little embarrassing that we as a nation allowed 100 per cent of our Penicillin to come from China, and all ...LinkedIn announces list of 50 best US colleges for long-term career success: Princeton leads, with Duke, UPenn, MIT and Cornell in top five'All Indians from India': NYU graduation video triggers major row; 'too much brown'Vanessa Bryant finally breaks silence on wild pregnancy rumors with a wild response featuring a Rihanna memeDrug trafficking, forcing migrant minors to work at hotels, visa fraud: Five Indian-Americans charged in NebraskaH-1B cap cases denied because of digital signatures?

PM Modi NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday marked his 12th consecutive Independence Day address from the Red Fort ramparts, breaking former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s record of 11 straight speeches.On the 79th Independence Day, he unveiled a series of initiatives aimed at making India self-reliant, technologically advanced, and economically stronger -- with the clear goal of becoming a developed nation by 2047.Mission Sudarshan ChakraAnnouncing an ambitious plan to strengthen India’s defence capabilities, PM Modi launched "Mission Sudarshan Chakra", inspired by the weapon of Lord Shri Krishna.The mission aims to create an indigenous air defence system similar to Israel’s Iron Dome to protect critical sites, including civilian areas, from terrorist attacks. The Prime Minister set a 2035 target for expanding and modernising this “national security shield” entirely through domestic research, development, and manufacturing.First Made-in-India semiconductor chipsPM Modi confirmed that India’s first domestically produced semiconductor chips will hit the market by the end of 2025. Highlighting decades of lost opportunity, he said the country’s early semiconductor ambitions were stalled “50-60 years ago,” while other nations surged ahead.The launch, he said, will be a turning point for India’s electronics, automotive, and defence sectors.High-power demography missionWarning of demographic changes in border areas, the Prime Minister alleged that infiltrators were threatening livelihoods, targeting women, and misleading tribal communities to seize land.He announced the launch of a “High-Power Demography Mission” to address these concerns, calling demographic shifts in sensitive regions “a direct threat to national security.”PM Viksit Bharat Rozgar YojanaThe Prime Minister officially rolled out the Rs 1 lakh crore "PM Viksit Bharat Rozgar Yojana", aimed at creating 3.5 crore jobs.Under the scheme, youth entering their first private sector job will receive Rs 15,000 from the government, while employers hiring them will get financial incentives.GST reforms as 'Diwali gift'Calling it a “double Diwali” for citizens, PM Modi announced that the government will soon implement next-generation GST reforms to drastically cut taxes on essential goods.He said the changes are “the need of the hour” to ease the financial burden on ordinary people.'Samudra Manthan'The prime minister revealed plans for a National Deep Water Exploration Mission, dubbed "Samudra Manthan", to explore oil and gas reserves in the ocean.The initiative will operate in mission mode and is expected to advance underwater engineering, mineral resource exploration, and ocean research.A large share of India’s budget is still spent on importing petrol, diesel, and gas. PM announced the launch of the National Deepwater Exploration Mission to harness ocean resources, along with major expansions in solar, hydrogen, hydro, and nuclear energy.Defence and space self-relianceThe Prime Minister urged young scientists and engineers to develop a fully indigenous jet engine for India’s fighter aircraft.In the space sector, he announced plans for India to have its own space station, alongside preparations for the Gaganyaan human spaceflight mission. He noted that reforms have enabled over 300 start-ups to enter the space sector, employing thousands of young innovators.Nuclear energy expansionAddressing future energy needs, PM Modi said India is working to increase its nuclear energy capacity tenfold by 2047, with 10 new reactors already in progress. He also highlighted a 30-fold increase in solar capacity over the past 11 years and ongoing investments in hydropower, hydrogen energy, and dam construction.Reform task forceTo accelerate growth, the Prime Minister announced a Reform Task Force that will modernise laws, policies, and governance systems to prepare India for a $10 trillion economy. The task force will work with fixed deadlines to deliver reforms aligned with global best practices.Centre reforms target lower costsThe government’s reforms are designed to cut compliance costs for startups, MSMEs, and entrepreneurs, while removing the fear of outdated legal provisions. The goal is to create a business-friendly environment that fosters innovation and supports economic self-reliance.Reduce compliance costs for startups, MSMEs, and entrepreneursProvide freedom from fear of arbitrary legal actionsEnsure laws are streamlined for ease of doing business'About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses the nation from the Red Fort on the occasion of the 79th Independence Day, in New Delhi. (Pic credit: PTI) NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said that a premeditated conspiracy is being orchestrated to change the demography of India through illegal infiltration. In a strongly worded speech, the Prime Minister said that these "ghuspaithiyas" (infiltrators) are posing major challenges, but no nation can tolerate intruders. To tackle this "new crisis", he announced a high-powered demographic mission. Addressing the nation on the 79th Independence Day, PM Modi said the country's forefathers made the supreme sacrifice to win freedom for Indians, and it is the duty of its citizens not to accept such activities.'Ghuspaithiyas snatching bread & butter, targeting daughters & sisters"I wish to warn the country about a concern that is emerging as a crisis. As part of a premeditated conspiracy, the country's demography is being changed. Seeds of a new crisis are being sown," PM Modi said. "These ghuspaithiyas (infiltrators) are snatching the bread and butter of our youth. These ghuspaithiyas are targeting our country's daughters and sisters. This will not be tolerated. These ghuspaithiyas are fooling innocent tribals and capturing their forest land. This country will not tolerate this," he asserted. What is demographic mission? PM Modi highlighted that the government is starting a high-powered demographic mission to tackle this crisis."From the ramparts of the Red Fort, I want to say that we have decided to start a high-powered demographic mission. This mission will tackle this serious crisis and will take care of the crisis looming large over our country in a set time frame. We are moving forward towards it," he announced.How can we hand over Bharat to them?PM Modi underscored the threats posed by infiltrators, saying that when demographic changes occur, they create a national security crisis. "It also creates a crisis for our unity, integrity and progress. It sows the seeds of social tension. No nation in the world can hand over itself to ghuspaithiyas, then how can we hand over Bharat to them?" PM Modi stressed."Our forefathers got freedom by making the supreme sacrifice. They gave us an independent India and it is our duty that we do not accept such activities. This will be our true tribute to them," he added.

Modi, wearing a saffron turban, urged citizens to work towards building a developed India. PM Modi at Red Fort NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered his longest Independence Day speech of 103 minutes from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Friday. The Prime Minister addressed the nation on a wide range of issues concerning India's national interest and announced multiple schemes.PM Modi's 2024 Independence Day speech, which was his first speech of his third straight term, lasted for 98 minutes, which was then the longest Independence Day speech. In 2023, he addressed the nation for almost 90 minutes. In 2019, he spoke for 92 minutes -- which was also his first speech of the second term. His shortest speech was in 2017 when he spoke for a little under an hour. He had delivered his first speech as a prime minister in 2014, where he had spoken for nearly 65 minutes. He spoke for 83 minutes in 2018.PM Modi on Friday also overtook Indira Gandhi’s record for the most consecutive Independence Day speeches from the Red Fort, delivering his 12th in a row. Only Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first prime minister, has given more consecutive speeches — 17 between 1947 and 1963. Indira Gandhi, who served two terms between 1966-77 and 1980-84, addressed the nation 16 times in total, with 11 of those being consecutive. PM Modi, who first spoke from the Red Fort in 2014, had last year broken Manmohan Singh’s record of 11 consecutive addresses.PM Modi, wearing a saffron turban, to lead the 79th Independence Day celebrations, addressing the nation from the historic Red Fort.

Both countries share a vision for a more peaceful, prosperous, and secure Indo-Pacific region, collaborating across various sectors including technology and space.  NEW DELHI: The United States on Friday extended congratulations to India on its 79th Independence Day and said that the "historic ties" between India and the US are "consequential and far-reaching."India is marking its 79th Independence Day on Friday with pride and patriotic zeal, celebrating the country’s liberation from more than two centuries of British colonial rule, which ended in 1947.In a statement, US State Secretary Marco Rubio said that America and India shared vision for a more peaceful, prosperous, and secure Indo-Pacific region. "On behalf of the United States, I extend our congratulations and warm wishes to the people of India as they celebrate their Independence Day on August 15. The historic relationship between the world’s largest democracy and the world’s oldest democracy is consequential and far-reaching," the statement read. "Our two countries are united by our shared vision for a more peaceful, prosperous, and secure Indo-Pacific region. Our partnership spans industries, promotes innovation, pushes the boundaries of critical and emerging technologies, and extends into space," he added. Ties between India and the United States have grown tense in recent weeks after US President Donald Trump claimed credit for brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan during May’s Operation Sindoor — a claim New Delhi firmly rejects, insisting no third party was involved. The friction deepened when Trump slapped 50% tariffs on Indian imports in retaliation for India’s purchase of Russian oil.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

This initiative aims to generate 3.5 crore jobs in two years, with a focus on first-time job seekers. The scheme provides incentives for both employees and employers to boost hiring and economic growth, with a substantial budget allocated for its implementation. . Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday announced a new jobs scheme, the Pradhan Mantri Viksit Bharat Rozgar Yojana (PM-VBRY), during his Independence Day speech at the Red Fort. “Today, I bring good news for the youth of our country. From today, under the PM Viksit Bharat Rozgar Yojana, sons and daughters getting their first job in the private sector will be given Rs 15,000,” he said. The scheme, approved earlier by the Union Cabinet, started on August 1, 2025. It replaces the earlier Employment Linked Incentive Scheme and is part of the government’s plan to create more jobs across the country. With a budget of Rs 99,446 crore, it aims to help create over 3.5 crore jobs in two years. Out of these, about 1.92 crore will be for people entering the job market for the first time. The benefits will apply to jobs created between 1 August 2025 and 31 July 2027. The scheme has two main parts. In the first, people getting their first job and earning up to Rs 1 lakh a month will get an incentive of up to Rs 15,000 in two payments, one after six months and the other after a year, if they also attend a financial awareness programme. Part of this money will be kept aside in a savings account to encourage saving. In the second part, employers who hire more workers will get up to Rs 3,000 a month for each new employee for two years, with manufacturing companies getting the benefit for up to four years. To qualify, employers must be registered with the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation and must hire at least two extra people if they have fewer than 50 employees, or five extra people if they have 50 or more. The government says the scheme will encourage more hiring and support economic growth.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

NEW DELHI: On India's 79th Independence Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, addressing the nation from the Red Fort, had a message for Pakistan - India will treat terrorists and those who aid them as one, and any future misadventure will meet decisive retribution at the hands of its armed forces. Praising the military, PM Modi said the operation had inflicted heavy losses on Pakistan, with new evidence of the damage surfacing daily. He reaffirmed that India would not bow to Islamabad’s “nuclear blackmail.” “What our forces achieved in Operation Sindoor has not been witnessed in decades,” PM Modi said. “We have set a new normal in tackling cross-border terrorism. I salute our brave soldiers who delivered a punishment for the Pahalgam attack far beyond the enemy’s imagination.”PM Modi said that India and its farmers have sole rights over the country’s share of the Indus river waters, branding the Indus Water Treaty with Pakistan as “unjust and one-sided.” PM Modi said the decades-old agreement had caused “enormous harm” to Indian agriculture, allowing rivers originating in India to irrigate “the fields of our enemies” while leaving Indian soil and farmers parched. “Blood and water cannot flow together,” he said, adding that the recent terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which killed 26 people. “The waters that belong to India will be used by India, for India’s farmers alone. We will not tolerate any arrangement that deprives them. This agreement is unacceptable to us,” PM Modi said. Signed in 1960 under World Bank mediation, the treaty has governed the sharing of the Indus and its tributaries between India and Pakistan. Modi said India’s farmers had endured “unimaginable losses” for decades under it — a situation his government would no longer accept.Also read | 79th Independence Day: 'India has now decided, blood and water will not flow together' - Top quotes from PM Modi's speechAbout the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Modi saluted the armed forces and highlighted India's stance against nuclear threats, referencing actions taken after the Pahalgam attack.  NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday addressed the nation from the ramparts of historic Red Fort for the 12th consecutive time on the occasion of 79th Independence Day.The celebration began with PM Modi paying floral tribute to Mahatma Gandhi at Rajghat. After receiving the Guard of Honour upon arrival at the Red Fort, PM Modi hoisted the flag.The theme of this year is 'Naya Bharat,' reflecting the government's vision of achieving 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047.PollWhich is more important for building a ‘Viksit Bharat’?Self-reliance in technologyStrengthening the economy"Wishing everyone a very happy Independence Day. May this day inspire us to keep working even harder to realise the dreams of our freedom fighters and build a Viksit Bharat. Jai Hind!," PM Modi wrote in a post on X. "This great festival of freedom is a festival of 140 crore resolutions," PM said from the ramparts of Red Fort, adding that it is a festival of hope and aspirations.Here are key quotes from his speech: "Whether it's the deserts or the peaks of the Himalayas, the shores of the ocean or the bustling cities, there is one voice across the nation: we all love India more than our lives," says PM Modi from the ramparts of Red Fort."For 75 years, the Constitution of India has been showing us the path like a lighthouse.""I salute our brave soldiers who punished masters of terror beyond their imagination.""India has decided that it will not tolerate nuclear threats anymore, we won't fall for any blackmail. Destruction inflicted by our armed forces in Pakistan was so widespread, new revelations are being made every day. After April 22 (Pahalgam attack), we gave armed forces a free hand to respond to terrorists." "India has now decided, blood and water will not flow together. The people have come to realize that the Indus Waters Treaty is unjust. Water from the Indus River system has been irrigating the lands of the enemy, while our own farmers have suffered. What kind of agreement is this that has caused such immense loss to our farmers for the past seven decades?""Slavery made us poor. It made us dependent, and over time, our dependence on others only grew. But our farmers led us toward self-reliance and ensured our food security. Even today, a nation's true pride lies in self-reliance, and that is the foundation of Viksit Bharat."Dependence on others raises questions about a nation’s independence. It is unfortunate when dependence becomes a habit, a dangerous one. That’s why we must remain aware and committed to becoming self-reliant. Self-reliance is not just about exports, imports, the rupee, or the dollar. It is about our capabilities, our strength to stand on our own.""Our enemies had no idea about the capability of 'Made in India', which weapons are simple and which are powerful enough to destroy them in a moment. Just think, if we were not self-reliant, would we have been able to carry out Operation Sindoor with such speed?""We are working in mission mode in the semiconductor sector, made-in-India chips will hit markets by end of this year. We have decided to make India self-reliant in energy; taking several initiatives in solar, hydrogen, nuclear sectors."Also read | 79th Independence Day: PM Modi continues 'safa' tradition; opts for saffron turban"India is now focusing actively on nuclear energy. We have taken significant steps in this direction, with 10 new nuclear reactors currently operational. By the time India celebrates 100 years of independence, we aim to increase our nuclear energy capacity tenfold." "Today, India is building a modern ecosystem across every sector. I appeal to the youth and to every department of the government: we must strive to produce Made-in-India jet engines for our fighter aircraft. We are known as the pharmacy of the world, but isn't it the need of the hour to invest more in research and development? Shouldn’t we be the ones providing the best and most affordable medicines for the welfare of humanity?""Our military will decide the time and give a fitting response to all acts of terror. Pakistan has lost its sleep after Operation Sindoor. India and its farmers have sole right over its share of waters.""Our Group Captain Subhanshu Shukla has returned from the Space Station, a moment of great pride for the nation. India is actively working on the Gaganyaan mission and is also planning its own space station. We must come together to change the destiny of our country. I appeal to the youth: step forward and contribute to this mission of national transformation.""The world values quality, and if we want to strengthen India's image in the global market, we must focus on producing high-quality products. We should work with the mantra: ‘Daam kam, dum zyada’, lower cost, higher value. Our independence came through immense sacrifice. Remember those years, when an entire nation lived and struggled for freedom. Their dedication gave us independence. Today, our mantra should be ‘Samriddh Bharat’, a prosperous India. If we continue to be vocal for local, we will achieve prosperity. The previous generation gave us freedom; this generation must commit to making India truly prosperous.""Need of hour to take a resolve for building a 'samarth' (strong) Bharat, just like our freedom fighters had envisioned 'free India'.""I am going to give a great gift on Diwali. In last 8 years, we did a big reform in GST, tax was simplified, now it is the demand of the time to make a review, we did, also talked to states, we are bringing 'next generation GST reform', it will be a gift on Diwali, tax on common, individual requirement services would be reduced significantly... MSMEs would benefit, it will also help the economy.""I have good news for the youth of our country. Today, on the 15th of August, we are launching a landmark scheme worth Rs 1 lakh crore, the Pradhan Mantri Viksit Bharat Rojgar Yojana. Under this scheme, the government will provide Rs 15,000 as support to individuals who secure their first job in the private sector. This initiative is expected to generate 3.5 crore job opportunities across the nation.""The world is confident about India's economy. We are a ray of hope amidst the global instability. Inflation is under control.""Past decade was of reform, perform and transform; now we have to focus on greater goals."We celebrate our diversity, it is our heritage. We witnessed this beautifully during the Prayagraj Maha Kumbh, where the spirit of unity in diversity truly comes alive. India is rich in linguistic diversity, and to honor that, we have granted classical language status to Marathi, Assamese, Bangla, Pali, and Prakrit...""I salute dedication of RSS volunteers in serving nation over past 100 years. India is proud of RSS' 100 years of dedication towards country, it is biggest NGO in world.""I wish to warn the country about a concern that is emerging as a crisis. As part of a premeditated conspiracy, the country's demography is being changed. Seeds of a new crisis are being sown. These ghuspaithiyas (infiltrators) are snatching the bread and butter of our youth. These ghuspaithiyas are targeting our country's daughters and sisters. This will not be tolerated. These ghuspaithiyas are fooling innocent tribals and capturing their forest land. This country will not tolerate this." Also read | PM Modi promises big Diwali gift!

A former associate editor with the Times of India, Jug Suraiya writes two regular columns for the print edition, Jugular Vein, which appears every Friday, and Second Opinion, which appears on Wednesdays. His blog takes a contrarian view of topical and timeless issues, political, social, economic and speculative. LESS

A populist slogan during Indira Gandhi’s regime was ‘The nation is on the move.’ Though whether the motion was in forward or reverse gear was open to question.
Today, the nation is very much on the move, quite literally, and its movement is decidedly outward bound.
According to a TOI report, Indians are spending an estimated $17bn on foreign sojourns, as compared with $17mn fifteen years ago, which represents a thousand per cent jump.
While a large chunk of this expenditure is for studying abroad, the biggest percentage increase has been for leisure travel, which is all the more remarkable in that the cost of the US dollar has gone up from ₹23 to almost ₹88.
Despite this cost deterrence, more and more Indians are spending more and more on foreign travel, and many are doing so on borrowed cash.
A credit card survey has shown that more of us (27%) are borrowing more money for foreign vacations than for home improvements (24%), medical expenses (9.6%), education (6.1%), or weddings (5.4%).
How did this travel bug bite India? Thirty years ago, Indians by and large, were stay-at-homes, rooted by family or community ties to the city, town, or village they belonged to.
If they travelled at all it was for work, business, or religious pilgrimage. Travel just for the heck of it was a rarity reserved for the extravagant or the eccentric.
This changed in 1986 when the govt introduced leave travel allowance, LTA, for public sector employees, which got extended to the private sector. The perk was meant to financially aid those in transferable jobs to make an annual return to home base. This gave an impetus to leisure travel.
Moving forward, liberalised foreign exchange has made travel abroad accessible to the growing middle class. The result is that the foreign-returned tag no longer has social cachet. That privilege is now reserved for the foreign non-returned – who leave the country and stay out through migration, legal or otherwise.

PM Modi pays tribute to Rajghat NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday greeted the nation on its 79th Independence Day and urged everyone to work even harder to build a developed Bharat."Wishing everyone a very happy Independence Day. May this day inspire us to keep working even harder to realise the dreams of our freedom fighters and build a Viksit Bharat. Jai Hind," Modi said in a post on X.Key points:PM Modi will be addressing the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort for the 12th time. Ahead of the address, the Prime Minister visited Rajghat and paid his tribute.In his 98-minute address on August 15 in 2024, he had made an unequivocal pitch for a "secular" civil code instead of the current framework which is "communal" and promoted "discrimination", and also for simultaneous polls.He had announced that 75,000 more medical seats will be created in the country in the next five years.Social ills like crimes against women have also figured prominently in some of his speeches, and so are his push for cleanliness and empowerment of women and traditionally disadvantaged communities.Political watchers will eagerly look out for any signalling from him on the foreign policy front at a time when India's generally solid ties with the US are under strain amid Trump's repeated claims of mediating cease fire between India and Pakistan and use of tariff to pressure India on trade.Trump's decision to single out India for high tariff of 50 per cent, his occasional praise of Pakistan and ceasefire claims have given the opposition fodder to attack the Modi government.With Parliament's Monsoon session continuing and marred by disruption from the Opposition, which has alleged poll irregularities and demanded a discussion on the Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls in poll-bound Bihar, it will be seen with interest whether the prime minister responds to the allegations.His government's muscular stand against Pakistan-sponsored terrorism and naxalism has been a regular highlight in Modi's annual speeches, and this year is unlikely to be any different.The prime minister had sought suggestions from citizens for his address, and it will be keenly watched if some of these ideas make it to his speech.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Tricolours are already visible across the country—in shops, streets, and markets—dominating clothing and everyday items. This year’s celebrations carry the theme ‘Naya Bharat,’ reflecting the government’s vision of achieving ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047.Upon arrival at the Red Fort, PM Modi will be received by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, MoS Defence Sanjay Seth, and Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, who will introduce Lieutenant General Bhavnish Kumar, General Officer Commanding (GOC), Delhi area, to the Prime Minister.The success of Operation Sindoor will also be celebrated during this year’s Independence Day functions. The view cutter at Gyanpath will display the Operation Sindoor logo, complemented by floral arrangements themed around the operation. Flying Officer Rashika Sharma will assist PM Modi in hoisting the flag, after which flower petals will be showered from two Mi-17 helicopters—one carrying the national flag and the other the Operation Sindoor flag. The aircraft will be piloted by Wing Commander Vinay Poonia and Wing Commander Aditya Jaiswal.After the flag-hoisting ceremony, the Prime Minister will address the nation. NCC cadets and ‘My Bharat’ volunteers will then sing the National Anthem. A total of 2,500 cadets from the Army, Navy, and Air Force, along with volunteers, will be seated on Gyanpath opposite the Rampart, forming the ‘Naya Bharat’ logo.Around 5,000 special guests from various walks of life will witness the celebrations, including the Indian contingent of Special Olympics 2025, winners of international sports events, Gold Medalists of Khelo India Para Games, and the best-performing farmers under the National Beekeeping and Honey Mission. Other invitees include top-performing farmers, traders, Sarpanches, young authors under PM YUVA, entrepreneurs under schemes like PM Van Dhan Yojana, SC/ST Hub, and NSTFDC, as well as beneficiaries of PM-DAKSH, SHREYAS, SHRESTA, VISVAS, PM Internship, PM Awaas Yojana Gramin, and My Bharat Volunteers.To promote patriotic fervour and celebrate Operation Sindoor, band performances will take place across the country on Independence Day evening for the first time. Bands from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Indian Coast Guard, NCC, CRPF, ITBP, CISF, SSB, BSF, IDS, RPF, and Assam Rifles will perform at over 140 prominent locations nationwide.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7 as a decisive military response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed 26 lives. The Indian Armed Forces targeted terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, eliminating over 100 terrorists. The government also sent seven multi-party delegations abroad to present India’s stand against cross-border terrorism.The Har Ghar Tiranga Abhiyan, launched at the Prime Minister’s call, has inspired citizens with a patriotic spirit. Under the Ministry of Culture, the 4th edition of this campaign was announced on August 11 as part of ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’, encouraging citizens to bring the Tiranga into their homes and hearts.Union Minister for Culture and Tourism Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said, "This year, we are going to celebrate the fourth edition of the Tiranga campaign, for which more than 5 lakh youths have registered as volunteers. These youths will inspire people for the Tiranga campaign."The Ministry of Culture is the nodal body for the campaign and is working closely with State Governments, Union Territories, educational institutions, community organisations, and the public to ensure widespread participation. Citizens are encouraged to hoist the Tiranga at homes, offices, and public spaces and share their celebrations online using the hashtag #HarGharTiranga.The campaign builds on the success of previous editions, encouraging personal and community engagement with the national flag. This year, the celebrations unfolded in phases, culminating on August 15, with a unified display of the Tiranga nationwide, symbolising a collective affirmation of national pride.The campaign’s strength lies in a whole-of-society approach, bringing together ministries, States, Union Territories, and citizens in a unified effort, ensuring the celebrations reach every part of the country and resonate with people from all walks of life.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The camp set up for pilgrims bore the brunt of the damage, leaving a mud-filled gorge where the langar stood. Floodwaters washed away several other structures, including a security post. Dozens of vehicles were damaged."Two CISF personnel were among the victims. Many of the pilgrims who died were having food in the langar when disaster struck," an official said.STUNNING Facts About Jammu & Kashmir's Chenab Rail Bridge You Need To Know | PM ModiChishoti is about 90km from Kishtwar and the last stop before pilgrims trek 8.5km to the ancient Machail Mata shrine.

"There are mud-caked bodies and critically injured people all around. The death toll could rise," he said."I just spoke to the Union home minister @AmitShah to brief him about the developing situation in Kishtwar region of Jammu," CM Omar Abdullah wrote on X, also announcing the cancellation of his scheduled "At Home" tea party on Independence Day."My thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by the cloudburst and flooding in Kishtwar, Jammu and Kashmir.

While not expected to make landfall on the US East Coast, its potential to intensify into a major hurricane raises concerns for Bermuda. Authorities are closely monitoring the storm's path, and emergency preparations are underway in vulnerable regions.  Tropical Storm Erin is intensifying in the Atlantic and is projected to become the first hurricane of the 2025 season by Friday, August 15. Meteorologists warn that Erin could escalate into a Category 3 major hurricane by the weekend, posing potential risks to the US East Coast and Bermuda. While the storm is not currently expected to make landfall on the mainland, authorities are closely monitoring its path, and emergency preparations are underway in vulnerable regions to minimize potential damage and ensure public safety.Erin Storm’s current path and areas at riskAs of August 14, 2025, Tropical Storm Erin is located about 790 miles east of the Northern Leeward Islands, moving westward at 17 mph with sustained winds of 60 mph. The storm is expected to pass north-northeast of Puerto Rico, Antigua and Barbuda, and the Virgin Islands. Tropical storm watches are in effect for Anguilla, Barbuda, St. Martin, St. Maarten, and surrounding islands. While Erin is projected to stay over open waters for now, its potential intensification into a major hurricane raises concerns for the US East Coast and Bermuda later next week.Emergency preparedness and state of emergency for stormIn anticipation of Erin's possible impact, local governments in the Virgin Islands are ramping up emergency response efforts. Authorities are urging residents to secure their property and stock essential supplies. No official state of emergency has been declared in the US mainland yet, but officials continue to monitor the storm closely. Should Erin’s trajectory shift toward the East Coast, emergency declarations and preparedness measures may be implemented in affected states.What residents should knowStay informed: Monitor updates from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and local authorities.Emergency kits: Prepare a disaster kit with water, non-perishable food, medications, flashlights, and batteries.Evacuation plans: Familiarize yourself with local evacuation routes and shelters.Secure property: Protect windows and doors, and clear gutters to prevent flooding.Follow official instructions: Adhere to evacuation orders and safety advisories issued by local officials.Although Erin is not currently projected to make US landfall, its potential to intensify and change course necessitates vigilance. Residents in vulnerable areas should prepare for possible impacts and stay updated on the storm’s developments.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

'Go back to where you came from': Staten Island crowd boos Zohran Mamdani- See video
Zohran Mamdani, New York City's Democratic mayoral nominee, faced vehement protests during a Staten Island visit. Shouts of "Go back to where you came from" and accusations of being a "commie" met Mamdani, who was holding an anti-Trump event. Protesters voiced support for Curtis Sliwa, citing Mamdani's socialist policies as unrepresentative of Staten Island's values.

Shouts of "Go back to where you came from" and accusations of being a "commie" met Mamdani, who was holding an anti-Trump event. Protesters voiced support for Curtis Sliwa, citing Mamdani's socialist policies as unrepresentative of Staten Island's values.  Not everyone welcomed New York City's Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, to Staten Island on Wednesday afternoon, as he faced protests outside the Istanbul Bay Authentic Mediterranean Restaurant. A protester wearing a "Trump girl" T-shirt and holding an American flag shouted at the 33-year-old self-described socialist as he exited the restaurant's back door, Fox news reported. "Go back to where you came from. We don't want you on Staten Island," the individual declared. During Mamdani's third anti-Trump event of the week, protesters outside the restaurant drowned out the introductory speeches with cowbells, sirens, and megaphones.Despite the heat in the crowded restaurant and the opposition outside, Mamdani maintained a smile throughout the event and told reporters, "It saddens me to hear language of being told to go back to where I came from, and yet, it is not surprising because it is so much of what characterises US President Donald Trump's politics." Mamdani was hosting his third "Five Boroughs Against Trump" event of the week on Wednesday, reaffirming his commitment to protecting New Yorkers from President Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration if elected mayor of New York City this November. "I will not let it dissuade me from continuing to come to Staten Island, from continuing to speak to New Yorkers, no matter where they live, no matter what politics they have," Mamdani said in response to the protesters. "Because I know that just as there are Republicans who feel that way, there are others who are sincere in their questions." Several protesters outside the restaurant told Fox News Digital that they planned to vote for Curtis Sliwa, CEO of the Guardian Angels, this November. "He's the only one that could save our city," Ed, a Staten Islander carrying a large American flag, said. Ed told Fox News Digital that he wanted to give Mamdani "a little surprise party" and let the socialist candidate know that his values do not represent those of Staten Island. "This is Trump country," said Manny, another protester and Wall Street retiree who said Mamdani's policies are "anti-Wall Street." President Trump won Staten Island by 30 points in the 2024 presidential election, according to The New York Times' data. Meanwhile, in neighbouring Brooklyn, former Vice President Kamala Harris carried the borough by 44 points. Tommy Banks, a native Staten Islander, said his message to Mamdani on Wednesday was simple: "Get out of town." "He wants to make everything free. He can't afford that. He's a socialist. He don't live that. We're not socialist," Banks said. Banks agreed with the other protesters outside the restaurant, telling Fox News Digital that "nobody else" could be mayor but Sliwa. "He's a true New Yorker. He's been fighting for New York all his life. Give him a chance to get in there," Banks added. Another protester, Liz, shouted, "Mamdani's a commie!" as the Democratic nominee departed in his SUV. Liz said she doesn't like Mamdani because "he's not a Democrat, he's a communist." She stated that Mamdani is trying to tempt New Yorkers with campaign promises like free childcare, free bus fare, and government-run grocery stores, but Liz warned it would be a "disaster" if he became mayor. When Mamdani declared victory in the Democratic primary, incumbent mayor Eric Adams, who is running as an independent, called Mamdani a "snake-oil salesman" who would "say and do anything to get elected." President Trump has often criticised Mamdani and his policies, calling him a "100% communist lunatic." Staten Islanders who spoke to Fox News Digital outside Mamdani's anti-Trump event on Wednesday largely echoed these sentiments, calling him a "commie" and criticising his socialist policies, which include freezing the rent, raising corporate taxes, and increasing the minimum wage. However, Shahana Masum, who sported a "Zohran for Staten Island" sticker on her purse and attended the event, told Fox News Digital that Mamdani is the person who is representing "me and my community." Masum said she has also been told to go back to her country. To that, she responded, "You didn't go back to your country, and I came here with dignity and with my visa, so don't tell me to leave."About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Toothbrush ban at ICE facility? Justice department opposes use of 'weapon' brush; Judge accuses Trump admin of engaging in 'unconstitutional' game
The Justice Department has opposed providing toothbrushes to detained migrants at a Manhattan ICE facility, claiming they could be used as weapons. A judge temporarily prohibited toothbrushes, pending further discussion, while migrants' lawyers argued for basic hygiene products.

A judge temporarily prohibited toothbrushes, pending further discussion, while migrants' lawyers argued for basic hygiene products. AI image used for representative purpose The US Justice Department has opposed the provision of toothbrushes to detained migrants at a Manhattan ICE facility, asserting that the teeth-cleaning tools could be used as dangerous “weapons”. Manhattan US Attorney Jay Clayton claimed a judge’s order on Wednesday to improve conditions at a makeshift jail located at 26 Federal Plaza, responding to complaints that asylum seekers had been held in dirty and overcrowded cells, New York Post reported. “Toothbrushes can readily be improvised as weapons,” Clayton’s office stated, adding that ICE agents would prefer to continue supplying migrants with “teeth-cleaning wipes” instead. No examples were provided by the feds of migrants using toothbrushes as weapons. However, jail inmates have previously fashioned toothbrushes into sharp tools by shaving down the handle. The threat level remains uncertain, considering that toothbrushes can be purchased at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Centre jail for 85 cents. Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled on Thursday to prohibit toothbrushes at the facility for the time being, pending further discussion. In response, the migrants’ lawyers submitted court papers asserting that “there is no basis to deny individuals detained at 26 Federal Plaza basic hygiene products” accessible at other ICE locations in the US. The toothbrush issue arises as ICE agents have been photographed arresting migrants almost daily outside their required immigration court hearings in the same federal building. These move attracted criticism on Thursday from a different federal judge, who accused the govt of engaging in an unconstitutional “game of detention roulette” with human beings. “Treating attendance in immigration court as a game of detention roulette is not consistent with the constitutional guarantee of due process,” Judge Dale Ho wrote. He based his ruling on the case of Carlos Javier Lopez Benitez, a Paraguay native working in construction with no criminal record, who was released from ICE custody after his July arrest outside immigration court.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Outperforming 934 participants, she contributed to a record 294 pythons removed during the 10-day event. The challenge highlights the critical role of citizen engagement in controlling this invasive species and protecting Florida's native wildlife.  A Florida woman has won the 2025 Florida Python Challenge after removing 60 invasive Burmese pythons from the Everglades, winning the grand prize of $10,000. Taylor Stanberry outperformed 934 participants from 30 U.S. states and Canada in a 10-day competition aimed at controlling the spread of this dangerous species. The event, held from July 11 to 20, saw a record 294 pythons removed from the wild, highlighting both the scale of the infestation and the critical role of citizen engagement in conservation. Officials described Stanberry’s achievement as a major win for Florida’s native wildlife.Taylor Stanberry’s record-breaking python achievementTaylor Stanberry, a Naples resident and self-described “venomous keeper” and “relocator,” captured 60 pythons during the challenge, more than any other participant. Known as the “new queen of the Everglades,” she demonstrated exceptional skill and patience, contributing significantly to efforts to curb the Burmese python population in Florida. Burmese pythons are highly adaptable and can lay 50–100 eggs at a time, making them a persistent threat to the Everglades’ delicate ecosystem. Her accomplishment underscores how individual action can make a measurable difference in wildlife conservation and sets a high benchmark for future competitors.The Florida Python Challenge: purpose and participationThe Florida Python Challenge is an annual event organized by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) to reduce the number of invasive pythons and raise public awareness about their impact on native ecosystems. This year, 934 participants competed across eight official locations, including Everglades National Park, to capture the most pythons within the 10-day window. Participants must complete online training and adhere to humane python-killing guidelines. Firearms, dogs, or other animals are not permitted, emphasizing safe and responsible removal.Conservation impact and community engagementThe record removal of 294 pythons in 2025 represents a milestone in ongoing conservation efforts. FWC Chairman Rodney Barreto noted, “With over 1,400 pythons removed during all Florida Python Challenge events to date and over 16,000 pythons removed by FWC and South Florida Water Management District contractors since 2017, collective efforts are the key to continuing to address the threats Burmese pythons pose to Florida’s native wildlife and ecosystems.” Pedro Ramos, superintendent of Everglades National Park, added that the challenge highlighted the importance of citizen participation in tackling invasive species.Understanding the threat of Burmese pythonsBurmese pythons are native to Southeast Asia but have become one of Florida’s most notorious invasive species due to the exotic pet trade. Their rapid reproduction and adaptability threaten the natural food chain in the Everglades, impacting native species and the overall ecosystem. Since 2000, over 23,000 pythons have been removed from the wild, but the challenge continues to play a crucial role in controlling their population. The annual event educates the public about the ecological risks and encourages responsible participation in wildlife management.Other competition highlightsAside from the grand prize winner, participants competed in various categories, including the “longest python” captured. Taylor Stanberry’s success has brought additional attention to the Python Challenge, inspiring new participants and emphasizing the importance of collaboration with partners like the South Florida Water Management District and the National Park Service. The inclusion of Everglades National Park as an official competition site this year provided both a new challenge and an opportunity to raise public awareness about the ongoing threat posed by invasive Burmese pythons.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Both countries share a vision for a more peaceful, prosperous, and secure Indo-Pacific region, collaborating across various sectors including technology and space.  NEW DELHI: The United States on Friday extended congratulations to India on its 79th Independence Day and said that the "historic ties" between India and the US are "consequential and far-reaching."India is marking its 79th Independence Day on Friday with pride and patriotic zeal, celebrating the country’s liberation from more than two centuries of British colonial rule, which ended in 1947.In a statement, US State Secretary Marco Rubio said that America and India shared vision for a more peaceful, prosperous, and secure Indo-Pacific region. "On behalf of the United States, I extend our congratulations and warm wishes to the people of India as they celebrate their Independence Day on August 15. The historic relationship between the world’s largest democracy and the world’s oldest democracy is consequential and far-reaching," the statement read. "Our two countries are united by our shared vision for a more peaceful, prosperous, and secure Indo-Pacific region. Our partnership spans industries, promotes innovation, pushes the boundaries of critical and emerging technologies, and extends into space," he added. Ties between India and the United States have grown tense in recent weeks after US President Donald Trump claimed credit for brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan during May’s Operation Sindoor — a claim New Delhi firmly rejects, insisting no third party was involved. The friction deepened when Trump slapped 50% tariffs on Indian imports in retaliation for India’s purchase of Russian oil.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The Hong Kong government said Wednesday it "strongly disapproved and rejected the slanderous remarks made by external forces" regarding Lai's case. Hong Kong tycoon Jimmy Lai (AP) HONG KONG: Hong Kong postponed media mogul Jimmy Lai's trial on Friday, awaiting a heart monitoring device -- the second delay this week to the democracy campaigner's case.The 77-year-old founder of the Apple Daily newspaper is charged with foreign collusion under Hong Kong's national security law, which Beijing imposed following huge and sometimes violent democracy protests in 2019.Closing arguments in the long-running trial were originally expected to begin Thursday, but all court sessions were suspended by heavy rain.As court resumed Friday, defence lawyer Robert Pang said that Lai had heart "palpitations" and experienced the feeling of "collapsing".Lai has been kept behind bars since December 2020, reportedly in solitary confinement, and concerns have previously been raised over the septuagenarian's welfare. Pang told AFP that the defence has requested Lai be excused from the closing arguments, as he is not required to speak."(Lai) believes the episodes will occur when he is fatigued, and coming to court fatigues him," Pang said. Judge Esther Toh said Lai should not worry about disturbing the court and could always speak up if he was uncomfortable.Prison-arranged medical staff had detected "no abnormality" with Lai's heart but had nevertheless arranged for a wearable heart monitor and medication, Toh said.Judge Alex Lee said it would be "prudent" to begin proceedings on Monday after the medical arrangements were sorted.- 'The world is watching' -The sprawling trial, which began in December 2023, is entering its final stages as Western nations and rights groups continue to call for Lai's release.Aside from the foreign collusion offence -- which could land him in prison for life -- Lai is also charged with "seditious publication" related to 161 op-eds.The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said Thursday that "the world is watching how Hong Kong treats its journalists".US President Donald Trump told a Fox News radio programme on Thursday that he had previously brought up the Lai case with Chinese President Xi Jinping."I'm going to do everything I can to save him... you could also understand President Xi would not be exactly thrilled," the outlet quoted Trump as saying.The Hong Kong government said Wednesday it "strongly disapproved and rejected the slanderous remarks made by external forces" regarding Lai's case.Lai is a British citizen and his son Sebastien has called on the government to do more, saying: "I don't want my father to die in jail."- 'Political prisoner' -Lai has given spirited testimony over more than 50 days, fielding questions about his political ideology, management style and overseas contacts.He described himself at least twice as a "political prisoner", which drew sharp rebukes from the three-judge panel.Prosecutors showed the court a diagram titled "(Lai's) external political connections", arguing that he had exerted influence in the United States, Britain and Taiwan.Lai has denied calling for sanctions against China and Hong Kong and said he never advocated separatism.Apple Daily was forced to close in 2021 after police raids and the arrests of its senior editors.A former Apple Daily employee surnamed Chang queued outside court on Friday to support Lai, describing him as a "caring" boss."His health worsened after he was taken into custody, but I think his spirit is strong, and I hope he can persist," Chang told AFP.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousDivine baby names inspired by Lord KrishnaastrologyAshnoor Kaur’s top 10 ultra-glam lookstvRubina Dilaik's powerful reality show lookstvIn pic: Radiant pictures of Pooja HegdeEntertainment5 human body parts we may no longer need in the futureLifestyleBollywood-approved ethnic sets that are perfect for Independence Day 2025Lifestyle10 Stunning ethnic looks of Megha Shettytv10 celeb-inspired Indian baby girl namesLifestyleOne's own enemy: 8 animals that get triggered by their own reflectionLifestyleIndependence Day 2025: 10 inspiring lines on Freedom that warm the heartLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Beyond the Crown: Lara Dutta’s surprising life stories9 health benefits of potatoes (backed by science)Janmashtami 2025: 5 diabetes-friendly sweet recipes for Janmashtami bhog50 Years of Thalaivar: Rajinikanth’s iconic movies that fans cherish forever7 workout supplements every fitness enthusiast should know5 simple chia seed recipes that help in weight loss5 foods that can lower the chances of getting a strokeWhy Aarti has 5 flames: The deep meaning behind itIndia at 79: PM Modi leads Independence Day celebrations - In pics5 unique and must-have desserts made with eggs123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingLeBron JamesTom BradyDwyane WadeBrock Lesnar Net WorthPlayStation Plus GamesShedeur SanderStefon DiggsJoy TaylorNYU StudentsPatrick MahmoesTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire Website'Go back to where you came from': Staten Island crowd boos Zohran Mamdani- See videoToothbrush ban at ICE facility?

The UAE passport now grants visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 185 countries, ranking it 8th strongest worldwide in 2025/ Representative image Starting August 18, 2025, UAE citizens will be allowed to renew their passports up to one year before the expiry date, a change from the earlier six-month window. The new rule, issued by the ICP, is part of a broader initiative to enhance travel flexibility, streamline official procedures, and strengthen the UAE passport’s global standing.New timeline for passport renewalsThe Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Ports Security (ICP) has revised the policy governing passport renewals for UAE citizens. As per the latest decision by Ali Mohammed Al Shamsi, Chairman of the ICP, Emiratis will now be permitted to renew their passports once the remaining validity is one year or less. This is a shift from the previous rule that allowed renewals only when six months or fewer were left before expiration. The change will be effective Monday, August 18, 2025, and is applicable to all UAE nationals with eligible passports. The aim is to allow for better advance planning, especially for international travel, while reducing disruptions in official transactions and providing extended use of digital documentation. ICP noted that the new timeline will also support seamless transitions for UAE citizens who travel frequently or are involved in long-term visa procedures abroad.Digital-first, accessible renewal processThe ICP has confirmed that the renewal process will remain efficient and widely accessible, continuing to focus on digital services to facilitate ease of access. Citizens can complete the entire renewal process online through the ICP smart services platform, accessible via both the official website and mobile application. The online process allows applicants to:  Fill out the application form   Upload necessary documentation   Make payments digitally   For those who prefer or require in-person assistance, customer happiness centers within the UAE will remain available. Additionally, UAE nationals living abroad can submit their applications through UAE embassies and consulates, and they also have the option to initiate the process online and collect the renewed passport from a diplomatic mission.UAE passport strength and global ranking This update comes at a time when the UAE passport continues to see a significant rise in its global ranking and travel privileges. As of 2025, the UAE passport:  Is ranked 8th globally according to the Henley Passport Index   Grants holders visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 185 countries   This is a marked improvement over previous years:  2022 & 2023: Ranked 15th   2024: Advanced to 11th   2025: Entered the Top 10, securing 8th place   Since the Henley Passport Index’s inception in 2006, the UAE passport has added 152 countries to its visa-free or visa-on-arrival list, reflecting the UAE's growing diplomatic ties and international mobility for its citizens. Chairman Al Shamsi highlighted that the UAE passport continues to rank as the world’s most powerful, trusted, and widely recognised travel document. The new decision, he added, is a strong boost to its global standing and further establishes the UAE’s passport issuance and renewal system as a leading model for the region and beyond.In terms of operations, the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs in Dubai has processed 7,425 passport renewals during the first half of 2025 alone. Since the opening of its center in 2008, over 139,000 passports have been issued to Emiratis through that facility.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The unrest, triggered by a corruption-related tragedy and fueled by accusations of government repression, saw rival groups confronting each other in Belgrade and Novi Sad.  At least 42 police officers, including 26 in Belgrade, were injured after a Clash erupted between rival groups of protesters in Serbia, as months of anti-governmental demonstrations boiled over into street violence for a second night, Tass news agency reported. A wave of anti-corruption protests has gripped Serbia since November, following the collapse of the Novi Sad railway station roof that killed 16 people, a tragedy widely blamed on entrenched corruption. Protesters gathered again in several cities across Serbia late on Wednesday, mainly in response to an attack by ruling party supporters on demonstrators in the town of Vrbas, about 160 km north of the capital, Belgrade. For the second night running, large groups of pro-government supporters, most wearing masks, confronted protesters. The two groups hurled bottles, stones and fireworks at each other. Police arrested nearly 50 people across the country. The worst violence was reported in parts of Belgrade and Novi Sad, where the protest movement first began. One man, later identified as a military police officer, fired a pistol into the air as protesters approached the ruling party’s offices in Novi Sad, causing panic, as per Guardian. Footage also appeared to show supporters of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party launching fireworks at protesters gathered outside the party’s headquarters there. Police intervened with teargas, and stun grenades could also be heard. Frustrated with government inaction, protesters demanded an investigation into the Novi Sad tragedy and piled pressure on the Serbian president, Aleksandar Vucic, to call early elections. Over the past nine months, thousands of mostly peaceful, student-led demonstrations have been held, some attracting hundreds of thousands. This week’s violence, however, marked a significant escalation and indicated the increasing strain on Vucic’s populist government, in power for 13 years. Since June 28, when about 140,000 demonstrators gathered in Belgrade, the government has responded with an “intensifying crackdown” on activists, according to a statement by UN human rights experts released earlier this month. Protesters and those linked to the movement had faced a “troubling pattern of repression” including excessive police force, intimidation and arbitrary arrest, the experts said. Vucic has remained defiant, repeatedly rejecting calls for early elections and denouncing the demonstrations as part of a foreign plot to overthrow him. After the Novi Sad shooting incident, officials confirmed the man was a member of a special military police unit usually tasked with protecting government ministers, Guardian reported. He had fired his weapon while “on a routine assignment when attacked by about 100 people”, officials said. The officer told journalists on Thursday: “I used my firearm and fired a shot into the air in a safe direction. At that moment, the attackers scattered.” Footage widely shared online showed a man wearing a black T-shirt and no clear military insignia pointing a pistol into the air near protesters. Military officials said that seven members of the same military police unit had been injured while on duty to “protect a specific person”, but gave no further details. Student protesters accused the police of protecting pro-government supporters while doing little to stop the attacks on their own gatherings. “The authorities tried to provoke a civil war last night,” the students wrote on their official Instagram page. They announced further protests for Thursday night. Vucic, who visited pro-government encampments overnight, denied his supporters had started the violence. “No one attacked them anywhere,” he said of the anti-government protesters, speaking at a late-night press conference. “They went everywhere to attack those who think differently.” While the protests have so far led to the resignation of the prime minister and the collapse of his cabinet, Vucic remains at the helm of a reshuffled government.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

This move rescinded directives by the city's police chief, Pamela Smith, that limited immigration inquiries and arrests based on federal warrants.  US Attorney General Pam Bondi has appointed Terry Cole, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), as Washington’s “emergency police commissioner,” granting him the powers of the police chief amid the federal takeover.On Thursday, Bondi , in a directive notice, said that Cole will assume “powers and duties vested in the District of Columbia Chief of Police.” She added that the Metropolitan Police Department “must receive approval from Commissioner Cole” before issuing any orders, AP reported.The Attorney General has rescinded a directive issued by Pamela Smith, the city's current police chief, that required MPD officers to share information with immigration agencies concerning individuals not in custody, such as those involved in traffic stops or checkpoints. Bondi stated that she was revoking that order along with other MPD policies that limited inquiries into immigration status and prevented arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants. "All new directives must now receive approval from Cole," the Attorney General said. The late-night announcement followed an eventful day in the ongoing federal operation. Smith's earlier directive effectively aligned Trump's initiatives on city law enforcement with his nationwide efforts to curb immigration, and Trump had commended it in the hours preceding Bondi's declaration. “That’s a very positive thing, I have heard that just happened,” Trump said of Smith’s order. “That’s a great step. That’s a great step if they’re doing that.” The police chief increased cooperation between her officers and federal immigration officials as President Donald Trump’s law enforcement takeover of the nation’s capital took root Thursday. National Guard troops watched over some of the world’s most renowned landmarks and Humvees took up position in front of the busy main train station.  The White House said 45 arrests were made Wednesday night, with 29 people arrested for living in the country illegally; other arrests included for distribution or possession of drugs, carrying a concealed weapon and assaulting a federal officer. Troops were stationed outside the Union Station transportation hub as the 800 Guard members activated by Trump begin missions that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts, the Pentagon said. “They will remain until law and order has been restored in the District as determined by the president, standing as the gatekeepers of our great nation’s capital,” Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said. “The National Guard is uniquely qualified for this mission as a community-based force with strong local ties and disciplined training.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Air Canada will provide full refunds and alternative travel arrangements where feasible.

Air Canada will provide full refunds and alternative travel arrangements where feasible. Air Canada executives leave after they are interrupted by Air Canada flight attendants during a press conference as a possible strike looms, in Toronto, on Thursday, Aug. 14, 2025. (AP Photo) Air Canada began canceling flights on Thursday, ahead of a possible work stoppage by flight attendants, who issued a 72-hour strike notice, potentially impacting hundreds of thousands of travelers.A complete shutdown of the country's largest airline threatens to affect approximately 1.3 lakh people daily, A. Mark Nasr, Chief Operations Officer for Air Canada, stated the airline has begun a gradual suspension of Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge operations. “All flights will be paused by Saturday early morning,” he said. Nasr added that this approach will help facilitate an orderly restart “which under the best circumstances will take a full week to complete.” He mentioned that the initial set of cancellations, involving several dozen flights, will impact long-haul overseas flights scheduled to depart Thursday night. “By tomorrow evening we expect to have cancelled flights affecting over 1 lakh customers,” Nasr said. “By the time we get to 1 am on Saturday morning we will be completely grounded.” Nasr said the grounding will affect 25,000 Canadians daily abroad who may become stranded. They anticipate 500 flights to be cancelled by the end of Friday. He further stated that customers whose flights are cancelled will be eligible for a full refund, and the airline has arranged with other Canadian and foreign carriers to provide alternative travel options “to the extent possible.”The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), representing attendants nationwide, issued a strike notice, leading Air Canada to announce a 72-hour lockout effective August 16. According to the union, 99.7 per cent of its members supported the strike, which will suspend operations from Saturday until a labour agreement is reached. “For the past nine months, we have put forward solid, data-driven proposals on wages and unpaid work, all rooted in fairness and industry standards,” said Wesley Lesosky, President of the Air Canada Component of CUPE. “Air Canada’s response to our proposals makes one thing clear: they are not interested in resolving these critical issues.” The airline stated that eight months of negotiations and an offer to go to arbitration failed to produce a deal.Some flight attendants at the airline's news conference on Thursday held up signs that read “Unpaid work won't fly” and “Poverty wages = UnCanadian.”Natasha Stea, who represents flight attendants in Montreal for the union, said she thinks the airline is counting on the government to intervene. Stea said they want a fair and equitable contract.“There is still time. I'm sure if we sat down and talked we could actually get to an agreement,” she said. On August 11, it proposed a 38 per cent pay increase over four years, along with additional benefits and protections, but the union rejected the offer.What to do if your Air Canada flight is cancelledJohn Gradek, who heads McGill University’s aviation management program, said that Canada’s Air Passenger Protection Regulations require airlines to promptly notify passengers of cancellations—via text, voicemail, or email—and outline their options, CBC reported. Typically, Air Canada must cover the cost of rebooking passengers on another airline so they arrive within 48 hours of their original scheduled time. If that’s not possible, or the alternative offered doesn’t meet the passenger’s needs, the airline must issue a refund for the unused ticket value. Expenses for hotels, meals, and other costs incurred while waiting must also be reimbursed—passengers should keep receipts and be prepared to submit them. Canadian North passengers should check how their booking was made: if the Air Canada leg was on a separate ticket, Air Canada is responsible for rebooking; if the journey was booked entirely through Canadian North, that carrier must arrange the replacement flight.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Trump believes Putin desires full control of Ukraine but insists this won't happen under his presidency. He also proposed a second meeting involving European leaders and Volodymyr Zelenskyy to foster peace negotiations.  US President Donald Trump on Thursday said that his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, won’t “mess around" with him ahead of a summit between the two world leaders in Alaska.The US president will be holding face-to-face talks with Putin at a US military base on Friday to negotiate a potential ceasefire in Ukraine.  During a press conference at the White House, Trump acknowledged that Putin is interested in gaining full territorial control of Ukraine but insists that won't happen with him as US president."I think President Putin would like to see a deal. I think if I weren't President, he would take over all of Ukraine. It's a a war that should never have happened. In my opinion, if I weren't President, he would much rather take off, take over all of Ukraine. But I am President, he is not going to mess around with me," Trump said. He also proposed that European leaders could be invited to participate in a second meeting, which would include Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump told Fox News Radio that the main aim of tomorrow’s meeting is to set up talks between Putin and the Ukrainian president, adding that he has three locations in mind for such a meeting. The US president, who is preparing to meet his Russian counterpart for the first time since 2018, expressed confidence that both leaders “will make peace”. Friday’s talks between the presidents will include a one-on-one meeting, a bilateral lunch with both delegations and a press conference, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. Earlier on Thursday, Putin praised Trump’s “sincere efforts” towards ending the war in Ukraine, telling Kremlin officials the US is making “quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the fighting”. The comments followed UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hosting Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Downing Street for talks, greeting the Ukrainian president with a warm hug outside his residence.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Conway criticized Trump's intimidation tactics. Taylor described facing repercussions for criticizing Trump. Donald Trump (AP image) and George Conway (Image: X/@C_3C_3)  George Conway, a conservative and prominent critic of President Donald Trump, has compared the Republican leader to Tony Soprano, the fictional mob boss from the TV series The Sopranos. The comment came in response to Trump’s federal takeover of Washington DC.Conway and former Homeland Security official Miles Taylor appeared on MSNBC Wednesday to discuss Trump placing the DC police under federal control and deploying the National Guard. Trump said the move was in response to “out of control” crime, although data shows violent crime in DC has been declining since its peak in 2023, as reported by the Independent. Conway, who was once married to Trump's adviser Kellyanne Conway, said, “We don’t have Ronald Reagan anymore. We have Tony Soprano. He’s holding people up, threatening them, bullying them, doing things beyond his legal authority. And that scares people.”He added that Trump intimidates those he sees as opponents. “We see the intimidation of people who have had the courage, like Miles [Taylor], to speak out and criticize the president,” Conway said. “There is no limit to how low he will go, and what he will do to intimidate and to threaten and to assert power over things.”Taylor, who served as Chief of Staff at the Department of Homeland Security under Trump’s first term, wrote an anonymous 2018 op-ed titled “I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration.” In it, he said many Trump appointees aimed to protect democratic institutions while preventing Trump’s “more misguided impulses.”In April, Trump had signed an executive order targeting Taylor, revoking his security clearance and instructing the Justice Department to investigate him. His attorneys also sent letters to the justice department and Homeland Security inspectors general, requesting an investigation.Taylor described the experience as deeply disruptive.“This has not been made easy, because once you are on the president's blacklist, all sorts of things in your life start to implode, businesses, relationships, friendships, financial, you have an army of lawyers,” he told MSNBC.Conway also expressed concern about federal involvement in local law enforcement across the country. Trump indicated Wednesday that the DC move could serve as a model for cities such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.“I also think it's important that people understand why it is that this kind of federal overreach is bad, and it's bad because it consolidates power in a federal government. And as Americans, we have never, never wanted that to happen,” Conway said. “We've always had a federal system where local authorities handle local things like crime and safety on the streets, public safety.”He added that such federal involvement could lead to abuse since there would be limited checks.Trump has also suggested extending the federal takeover of DC police beyond the 30-day limit, which would require Congressional approval. He expects Republican support for the extension to be nearly unanimous.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

He criticized Warren's past claims and her support for a New York mayoral candidate. Warren had accused the Trump administration of weakening Social Security. She proposed measures to strengthen the system and expand benefits. Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren (AP images) President Donald Trump on Thursday said that Senator Elizabeth Warren “has got to take a drug test” in response to her claims that he is trying to cut Social Security.Trump made the remarks during a White House event marking the 90th anniversary of the Social Security Act, where he pledged to strengthen the program “for generations to come.”"It's so vicious what they do. Elizabeth Warren said she was an Indian. We call her Pocahontas. She's a liar. She lied her whole career," Trump said. "Based on the fact that she was an Indian, she was able to get into certain colleges, get certain jobs, get into certain universities to work there. And she's a liar and a mean person." Trump also criticized Warren for supporting Democratic Socialist New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. "She's a nutjob. I watched her the other night. She's all hopped up endorsing a communist in New York City, and she was all excited and jumping up and down. She's got to take a drug test. She really, though, she's got to take a drug test. There's no way somebody can act that way and be normal.”Earlier this year, Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, wrote an op-ed for Fox News claiming that Social Security is under unprecedented attack under the Trump administration. She criticized billionaire Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Elon Musk, alleging attempts to weaken the program by firing workers, closing offices and cutting services, as reported by Fox News.Warren said that Social Security services should not be cut or Americans’ benefits threatened. She added that people are struggling with high prices while their retirement savings shrink. She called for a temporary increase in benefits to provide relief and suggested lifting the cap on contributions from millionaires and billionaires to secure the system long-term and fund permanent benefit expansion.Trump defended his administration’s approach, saying, “We've already kicked nearly 275,000 illegal aliens off of the Social Security system."The US President said that many of these people have already left the country, yet they were still receiving Social Security checks. He added that removing them strengthens the system and contrasted with former President Joe Biden, who he claimed did not remove anyone and allowed everyone to stay on.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

A video of NYU students sharing their joy of joining jobs straight after their graduation turned into a controversial one as social media users pointed out that almost none of the students interviewed in the video were American. While many users complained that all of them were Indians, all of them were not Indian but mostly all of them were Asians. The video did not reveal their names and all assumptions were based on the appearance and the accent of the graduates. "NYU just posted a video of where their graduates are heading to work after college. Anyone notice anything in this video?" the video meant for rage-bait was captioned. Many users did not take the bait and said they all looked like America-born immigrants and there was nothing wrong about it. Some, in fact, pointed out the lack of diversity in their jobs, showing they are not interested in other fields. "Nice dog whistle. The reason the US is an economic powerhouse is because of it’s cognitively elite immigrants. But yeah, keep being mad at them," one wrote. "All of them must be sent back. We must reclaim our universities for Americans," another wrote.PollDo you think diversity among graduates entering the workforce is a strength?Yes, it brings fresh perspectivesNo, it affects local opportunities"Can someone please explain how these foreigners get into this school, the how can they afford it? After they got here to this country and got into this school and all that good stuff , how do they get jobs in the biggest companies on earth? I was born in Brooklyn , I can’t even get a job at Burger King. Asking for a friend thanks," one wrote. "Why is America educating its enemies? I’ve heard that they also get scholarships and aid. What are we doing here?" one comment read. "All the Indians are from India with accents not American born and they’re taking jobs away from American born graduates," a user wrote. "Too much brown. And a lot of purple," one wrote, purple being the color of their graduation robe. With the big tech companies announcing major layoffs this year, all eyes are on the hirings and how much of it actually goes to American graduates.

He replaced table salt with sodium bromide. The man showed paranoia and hallucinations. Doctors found high bromide levels in his body. He was trying to eliminate table salt from his diet. ChatGPT suggested bromide as a chloride replacement. The AI chatbot did not provide health warnings. . A 60-year-old man was hospitalized for three weeks after replacing table salt with sodium bromide following advice from the AI chatbot ChatGPT.The case was detailed in a report published this month in the Annals of Internal Medicine by three physicians from the University of Washington. According to the report, the man had no prior psychiatric history when he arrived at the hospital "expressing concern that his neighbor was poisoning him."He reported that he had been distilling his own water at home and appeared paranoid about the water he was offered. After lab tests and consultation with poison control, doctors found high levels of bromide in the body, as reported by NBC News. "In the first 24 hours of admission, he expressed increasing paranoia and auditory and visual hallucinations, which, after attempting to escape, resulted in an involuntary psychiatric hold for grave disability," the case report said.Once stabilized, the man revealed that he had conducted a "personal experiment" to eliminate table salt from his diet after reading about its potential health risks. He said he had consulted ChatGPT before making the change, which he followed for three months.The physicians did not have access to the man’s exact ChatGPT conversation logs. However, when they asked ChatGPT 3.5 what chloride could be replaced with, the AI suggested bromide. "Though the reply stated that context matters, it did not provide a specific health warning, nor did it inquire about why we wanted to know, as we presume a medical professional would do," the report said. In a prior statement to Fox News, OpenAI the parent company has emphasized that the chatbot is not intended for treating any health condition. "We have safety teams working on reducing risks and have trained our AI systems to encourage people to seek professional guidance," the statement said.The report noted that bromide toxicity was more common in the early 1900s, when bromide salts were found in over-the-counter medications and sedatives and accounted for about 8% of psychiatric admissions. Today, bromide is primarily used in veterinary medicine as an anti-epileptic treatment for cats and dogs, according to the National Library of Medicine.The report said the syndrome is rare, but cases have recently re-emerged because bromide-containing substances have become more widely available online.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The construction on a tract of land east of Jerusalem named E1 has been has been under consideration for more than two decades, and is especially controversial because it is one of the last geographic links between the major West Bank cities of Ramallah and Bethlehem. The two cities are 22 kilometres apart by air. But once an Israeli settlement is completed, it would require Palestinians travelling between cities to drive several kilometres out of their way and pass through multiple checkpoints. Standing at the site of the planned settlement in Maale Adumim on Thursday, Smotrich, a settler himself, said PM Netanyahu and US President Trump had agreed to the revival of the E1 development, though there was no immediate confirmation from either. "This reality finally buries the idea of a Palestinian state, because there is nothing to recognise and no one to recognise," Smotrich said on Thursday. "Whoever in the world is trying to recognise a Palestinian state today will receive our answer on the ground. Not with documents nor with decisions or statements, but with facts. Facts of houses, facts of neighbourhoods," he said.Israel froze construction plans at Maale Adumim in 2012, and again after a revival in 2020, because of objections from the US, European allies and other powers who considered the project a threat to any peace deal with the Palestinians.Palestinians fear the settlement building in the West Bank will rob them of any chance to build a state of their own in the area. Smotrich's spokesperson said the minister had approved the plan to build 3,401 houses for Israeli settlers between an existing settlement in the West Bank and Jerusalem.Nabil Abu Rudeineh, the Palestinian president's spokesperson, called on the US to pressure Israel to stop settlement building.

NetChoice, representing major social media platforms, sought to block the law, arguing it violates the First Amendment. US Supreme Court (AP image)  The US Supreme Court on Thursday declined to temporarily block a Mississippi law that requires age verification and parental consent for minors to use social media platforms.The law, aimed at protecting young people from potential online harm, will remain in effect while legal challenges continue. It is one of several measures passed by US states to curb the influence of social media on children.NetChoice – a group representing companies including Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, X and YouTube had asked the Supreme Court to halt the law after the New Orleans-based 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals allowed its enforcement. A lower court had earlier blocked the law, ruling it likely violated the First Amendment.US District Judge Sul Ozerden said the measure was overly broad and that parents already have other ways to monitor their children’s online activity.The Supreme Court did not explain its decision. However, Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted that while the law may be unconstitutional, NetChoice had not proven that enforcing it during the court battle would cause enough harm to justify halting it, USA Today reported.NetChoice attorney Paul Taske called the ruling a “procedural delay” and expressed confidence the group would ultimately prevail in protecting free speech rights.“Although we’re disappointed with the Court’s decision, Justice Kavanaugh’s concurrence makes clear that NetChoice will ultimately succeed in defending the First Amendment − not just in this case but across all NetChoice’s ID-for-Speech lawsuits," Taske said in a statement.Mississippi officials defended the law, saying it targets platforms that allow predators to contact minors. They cited a case in which a 16-year-old boy took his own life after he met someone on Instagram who threatened to expose their sexual encounter unless he paid $1,000.The state also argued that blocking the law conflicted with the Supreme Court’s earlier decision to uphold a Texas law requiring age verification for pornographic websites.NetChoice maintains the law infringes on free speech by forcing all user, including adults to provide personal information to access online platforms. "Social media is the modern printing press − it allows all Americans to share their thoughts and perspectives,” Taske said. “Just as the government can’t force you to provide identification to read a newspaper, the same holds true when that news is available online.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

'Six or seven planes came down': Trump again claims he solved India-Pakistan issue; 'they were ready to go'
Donald Trump claimed to have brokered peace between India and Pakistan ahead of his Alaska summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. "Six or seven planes came down. They were ready to go. Maybe nuclear. We solved that," Trump said about the India-Pakistan tension. Air Chief Marshal Staff Amar Preet Singh recently said India shot down five Pakistani fighter jets and one other large aircraft during Operation Sindoor. Pakistan rejected the claim.

Trump again claimed he solved the India-Pakistan tension. US President Donald Trump again claimed he brokered peace between India and Pakistan when the countries were probably going "nuclear". The statement came as Trump is all set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday in Alaska to settle the Russia-Ukraine war. As Trump spoke about the negotiations he facilitated since coming to power, he mentioned India and Pakistan, though India repeatedly rejected Trump's ceasefire claims. "I've solved six wars in the last six months, little more than six months now. And I'm very proud of it. We had one war raging, as you know, for 37 years. One in the Congo with Rwanda was raging for 31 years. We solved six of them. Made peace, not just solved them. If you look at Pakistan and India. Planes were being knocked out of the air. Six or seven planes came down. They were ready to go. Maybe nuclear. We solved that," Trump said. Air Chief Marshal Staff Amar Preet Singh recently said India shot down five Pakistani fighter jets and one other large aircraft during Operation Sindoor. Pakistan rejected the claim. On his Alaska meeting, Trump said the more important meeting will be the second meeting he will have with Putin after he sets the stage at the first meeting. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and some of the European leaders may take part in the second meeting, apart from him and Putin."I think President Putin will make peace, President Zelenskyy will make peace. We will see if they can get along. And if they can, it will be great. Trump said he thought solving the Russia-Ukraine war would be the easiest one, but it's actually the most difficult one. This war has no reason and would have never started, had he been the president, Trump said reiterating that the Russia-Ukraine war is Biden's war.

One of the group took his metal water bottle and hit him above the eye, causing heavy bleeding. He was taken to hospital where he received eight stitches. Gardaí confirmed they are investigating the assault and his injuries are “non-life threatening”.An Indian-origin woman has put a post on Reddit saying her 60-year-old father was harassed by boys, aged around seven and eight, who tried to take his wallet at a bus stop in Dublin on Aug 9.These are just the latest in a string of racist attacks targeting Indians in Ireland which have left the Indian community terrified to step outside.India Day in Ireland, which celebrates the country’s cultural ties, has been postponed this Sunday owing to the wave of hate crimes. The event has been organised by the Ireland India Council since 2015. A Ficci India Day event is going ahead in Dublin on Aug 17.Indian community leaders met Ireland deputy PM Simon Harris on Monday after which he condemned the “despicable acts of violence and racism”.Chairman of the Ireland India Council Prashant Shukla told Ireland AM: “We weren’t worried about the event itself as the Gardaí assured us about safety, but we were worried about the perception it could lead to further attacks. Our message to the Irish community is that these attacks are attacks on your economy and industry. Policing needs to go to the next level. I feel there are not proper investigations and arrests. We are all working, paying taxes and contributing to the economy. No one is getting a free house. People are spreading misinformation that Indians buying houses is causing house prices to go up.”President of Ireland Michael D Higgins on Tuesday also condemned the attacks. “A lot of Indians are reconsidering their choices and may move back to India if the situation doesn’t improve. It is mostly being caused by far-right groups encouraging teenagers to attack immigrants. Indians are the most visible immigrants here,” said Indian national Some Aditya Mandal, who has worked in Dublin for eight years.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle10 baby names that mean creativity and visionLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?Maharashtra’s UNESCO World Heritage Sites and other iconic monuments for history loversRajinikanth completes 50 years in cinema: Lesser-known facts about the ‘Coolie’ star6 lizards that prove reptiles can be adorableHow to unrot your brain: 5 effective steps to sharpen focus and boost mental clarityFrom Mullum Malarum to Kabali: Rajinikanth’s most emotional movies that fans still cherish123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

Dr Ajay Aggarwal, an Indian-origin pain medicine doctor from Houston, has agreed to pay over $2 million to resolve allegations of medical fraud against him, the US Justice Department revealed. Between 2021 and 2023, the 63-year-old doctor billed federally funded health care programs like Medicare and the Department of Labor’s Workers’ Compensation Programs for surgical implants that he never performed. Dr Aggarwal received thousands of dollars per procedure, but patients received simple devices which required no surgery. And all device placements used to take place at Aggarwal's clinic, not a hospital or surgical center. “A doctor who uses simple medical devices on his patients, yet bills Medicare for a sophisticated spinal surgery, is billing the American taxpayer, plain and simple,” said US Attorney Nicholas J Ganjei.. “The Southern District of Texas will ensure that losses to federally funded healthcare programs from fraudulent billing, like what happened here, are recouped and that wrongdoers are held accountable.”PollDoes the healthcare billing system need stricter monitoring to prevent fraud?YesNoA 2023 document of the DOJ revealed that earlier he was accused of giving unnecessary treatment to federal employees with federal workers' compensation benefits and his pharmacy Medley, which was officially owned by his wife, filed the prescriptions. An employee of Medley acted as a whistleblower and said that during his term of employment, he saw patients being sent unnecessary with unnecessary medications being prescribed. In some cases, the patients did not even see or meet Dr Aggarwal. And Medley employees were allegedly instructed to auto-fill medications on a monthly basis and to use pre-printed prescription pads to submit the prescriptions to DOL-OWCP without consideration of medical need. The new fraud of Dr Aggarwal came to be reported at a time when foreign doctors are under fire, while several Republican leaders said US needs more doctors and foreign doctors can fill the gap.

Govt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status; convictions of 2 years or more will lead to cancellation

The OCI card can also be revoked if they are charge-sheeted for an offense that carries a potential jail term of seven years or more, according to a recent notification.  Indian-origin foreign nationals holding an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card could now lose it if they face serious criminal charges or convictions, the government has announced.In a fresh gazette notification, the ministry of home affairs said that the OCI registration will be cancelled if the holder is sentenced to imprisonment for two years or more, or is named in a charge sheet for an offence carrying a jail term of seven years or more."In exercise of the powers conferred by the clause (da) of section 7D of the Citizenship Act, 1955 (57 of 1955), the central government hereby states that an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) registration shall be liable to get cancelled when a person has been sentenced to imprisonment for term of not less than two years or has been charge-sheeted for an offence entailing punishment of imprisonment for seven years or more," the notification said, as cited by PTI.PollShould stricter rules be applied to Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) cardholders?NoYesThe OCI card allows Indian-origin foreign nationals to visit India without a visa. The scheme, introduced in August 2005, enables registration as OCI for all persons of Indian origin who were citizens of India on January 26, 1950 or later, or were eligible to become citizens on that date, except for those who are, or have been, citizens of Pakistan, Bangladesh or any other country specified by the government in the official gazette.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Indian-origin Dr Vinay Prasad returns to FDA weeks after exit
Dr Vinay Prasad, previously ousted from his FDA vaccine chief position due to criticism from Laura Loomer over past anti-Trump comments and drug approval decisions, has been reinstated. This unusual move suggests the influence of RFK Jr within the Trump administration despite pressure from right-wing activists. RFK Jr opposed anti-vaxxer Dr Prasad's exit and remained invested to bring him back.

This unusual move suggests the influence of RFK Jr within the Trump administration despite pressure from right-wing activists. RFK Jr opposed anti-vaxxer Dr Prasad's exit and remained invested to bring him back.  Dr Vinay Prasad is back at his FDA job weeks after exit that was prompted by right-wing activist Laura Loomer's campaigning against Prasad. Dr Vinay Prasad, the Indian-origin vaccine chief of the FDA who was forced to resign in July after far-right activist Laura Loomer led a campaign against him, has been reinstated to his job in an unusual instance. Laura Loomer pointed out the critical comments that Dr Prasad made about President Donald Trump before joining the administration, while some of his decisions to deny drug approvals also came under fire. A Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson confirmed to the New York Times that Dr Prasad is returning to the agency. “At the F.D.A.’s request, Dr. Vinay Prasad is resuming leadership of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research,” Andrew Nixon, a health department spokesman, said in a statement.The NYT report observed that Dr Prasad's rehiring suggests that the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr., and the FDA commissioner, Dr Marty Makary, remain influential enough in the Trump administration to employ someone who had previously expressed disdain for Trump and his followers.Loomer reacted to the reinstatement and called in another "egregious personnel decision". "In another egregious personnel decision under the Trump administration, it is now being reported that longtime progressive Marxist Vinay Prasad who referred to President Trump’s supporters as criminals and compared them to drug addicts after saying he stabbed a Trump voodoo doll to “curse Trump” is apparently back at FDA," Loomer wrote.RFK Jr tapped Dr Prasad in May when the previous head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation left the role. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Dr Prasad gained prominence as an outspoken critic of vaccines and mask mandate. In his short stint at the FDA since May, Dr Prasad limited the use of Covid-19 vaccines and promoted warnings about a rare side effect of the vaccines. When he resigned from his role weeks ago, a department spokesperson told the NYT: "Dr. Prasad did not want to be a distraction to the great work of the FDA in the Trump administration and has decided to return to California and spend more time with his family."Kennedy, however, opposed Prasad's departure from the role and remained invested in bringing him back. Dr Prasad was born and brought up in Ohio and Chicago to Indian immigrant parents.

An Indian-origin techie, Manasi Mishra, who graduated with a computer science degree from Purdue University, revealed in a TikTok video as she was getting ready that the only company that called her for an interview was Chipotle. Titled 'Chipotle Interview GRWM', the TikTok video went viral as she appealed 'somebody pls hire me'. In an interview with New York Times, after the video went viral, Mishra revealed that growing up near Silicon Valley, she was used to the narrative that if she learned to code, worked hard and studied computer science, she could get a six-figure starting salary. But recent graduates are finding it hard because of the spread of AI programming tools and also the recent layoffs at companies like Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft.The NYT story confirmed that Mishra did not get the burrito-making gig at Chipotle, and she finally found a sales position job at a tech company.Mishra's story and the NYT article triggered a major debate on the present job situation, layoff and how much of it should be blamed on foreign workers, AI etc. "This is why I really do feel for Gen Z. This young woman was told her whole life by every authority figure that she should study hard, do well in school, and pursue a career in tech. She went to Purdue, one of the best engineering schools in the country. She studied computer science, not gender ideology or basket weaving," one viral comment read on X. "And still she could not even get a job at Chipotle let alone in her field. She did literally everything “right” but, to what end? This situation is not sustainable. H1B and other work visas, as well as offshoring, are getting out of control and abusive. Policymakers should care about the young generation," the person wrote. Many people commented that the jobs that the Indian-origin person missed must have gone to people from India who are on H-1B.

(Photo: DailyEcho/Padharo) Ankit Vaghela, an Indian-origin restaurant owner in Southampton, was told by the police that they could not come to his 'Padharo' when he called 999 to report a break-in. The vandals broke in and fled with several bottles of expensive alcohol and cash but the police helpline asked them to email the CCTV footage of the three burglars who broke in last week.Vaghela decided to get proactive and review the footage first. He discovered his cash register without the cash, abandoned along with some smashed liquor bottles strewn on a nearby road. “It was very heartbreaking to be told that officers will be able to review the damage in three to five working days and that no forensics was available at the time,” said Vaghela.“There was glass everywhere. As a business, we can’t afford to remain closed and had to get things cleaned up and the glass fixed. We are still struggling to operate smoothly without a proper cash register, which will take time, but are determined to welcome our guests with the same level of service we are known for in the city,” he said.The Hampshire Police said they did not underestimate the July 31 case but they understood that their investigation could start without their immediate attendance at the site, as the offenders were not there. “Every deployment decision is based on informed risk assessments to make sure the most serious cases are prioritised, and officers are on scene where there is an immediate threat to life or a crime in action,” the police force said in a statement.“On this occasion, based on the initial information we were given regarding the offenders no longer being at the scene, our investigation could get underway without any immediate attendance. That investigation is progressing with lines of enquiry identified, such as CCTV, and we are in touch with the victim to provide them updates on our investigation,” added the statement, along with an appeal to the public for any information related to the burglary."It means nothing now, the damage is done. Officers were not willing to visit the restaurant," Vaghela told to local news outlets.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

In a separate incident, Laxman Das, an Indian sous chef in Dublin, was attacked and robbed while going to work. These incidents follow a series of recent assaults targeting Indians in Ireland, raising concerns about racism.  TOI correspondent from London: A six-year-old Indian-origin girl and an Indian sous chef are the latest victims in the ongoing spate of racist attacks targeting Indian nationals and Indian-origin Irish people in Ireland.The girl, whose family hail from Kottayam, Kerala, was playing outside her house in Waterford City, southeast Ireland, with friends at 7.30pm on Monday evening when a gang of boys and one girl called her a “dirty Indian” and told her to “go back to India”. She was born in Ireland. Five of the gang also punched her in the face, hit her private parts with a bicycle, punched her neck and twisted her hair.Her mother moved to Ireland eight years ago from Kottayam to work as a nurse with her husband and recently became an Irish citizen.The mother said the gang was made up of boys aged 12 to 14 and a girl aged eight. She said her daughter came home in floods of tears and is now too scared to play outside. She told the Irish Mirror: “I never expected that such an incident would happen. I thought she would be safe here. Even in front of our own house she can’t play safely. I am a nurse, I am doing my best to take care of people. I do my work and I am 100% professional. I changed my citizenship, but still we are called dirty people and even my kids are not safe. We came here to fill a labour gap. We are professionals — we have all the certificates…”The mother studied BSc Nursing at University of Calicut and went to Mount Carmel Higher Secondary School in Kottayam.“Gardaí (Irish national police) responded to a report of an alleged assault in the Kilbarry area of Waterford city on the evening of Monday 4 August. Investigations are ongoing,” a Garda spokesperson told TOI.On Wednesday morning Laxman Das from Kolkata, who works as a sous chef at the Anantara The Marker Dublin hotel, was assaulted near the Hilton Hotel by three people while on his way to work. He was taken to St Vincent's University Hospital. His phone, cash and electric bike were stolen.These come following a spate of attacks against Indians in Ireland in recent weeks — on July 19, July 24, July 27, and on Aug 1 when a cab driver was assaulted.The Gardaí said they are still investigating these attacks and no one has been arrested.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning looks of Binny Sebastiantv10 baby names that mean ‘divine light’ or ‘sacred glow’Lifestyle10 Birds with the "wildest dating rituals"LifestyleRaksha Bandhan: 10 iconic lines of famous Hindi poets that capture essence of the festivalLifestyleKarishma Tanna Stuns with Style and SpiritEntertainmentFrom Moong to Chia Sprouts: How to grow your breakfast in balconyLifestyleBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Here’s how much each contestant earns dailytv10 creatures that survive in the deepest parts of the oceanLifestyleRaksha Bandhan: 10 quotes that describe the beautiful bond between brothers and sistersLifestyleHow to do step-by-step Ayurveda hair therapy at homeLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Threads of Love, Threads of Tradition: How different Indian states celebrate Raksha BandhanFrom chapatis to cake: 7 delicious ways to use overripe bananasInternational Cat Day 2025: From Persian to Bengal Cat-- 5 most beautiful and popular pet cat breeds in the world5 diseases moles on your body might indicate and should not be ignoredNot-so popular drinks that help in weightloss10 places in South Africa that aren’t to be missed in a lifetimeMemorable style outings of Princess CharlotteHow Kangana Ranaut turned fame into fearless politicsFrom ₹6 Lakh to ₹40 Lakh: A peek into Kamal Haasan’s ultra-luxe watch closetFrom Archana reacting to a hate comment to son Aaryamann revealing how he impressed girlfriend Yogita Bihani: Archana Puran Singh shares candid moments123Hot PicksGlobal Standard indexUS stocks todayIndia-US tariffIntel CEOMukesh AmbaniUS jobless dataRussia crude oilTop TrendingTom BradyDonald TrumpSouth Park EpisodeCall of DutyMalik BeasleyBattlefield 6 Beta OpensPrivate School in IndianaLuka Doncic Weight LossLinda McMahonLakers RumorsTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteUAE launches national programme to train Emiratis in space mission design and satellite engineering'PM Modi can't, shouldn't bend knee to Donald Trump': US tariffs on India draws rare bipartisan concern in US - watch'Enormous mistake': What Trump's former NSA John Bolton said on India tariffChild assault under false identity: Indian man commits suicide in US jail months after 35-year prison sentence, claim reportsLove gone wild: Indian man faces deportation for harassing UK zoo colleague for 6 months; didn’t stop even after restraining order'Before judging...': Wife of Pakistani man Salman Iftikhar who threatened Virgin Atlantic air hostess with gangrape defends outburstFriedrich Merz halts German military exports to Israel over Gaza issue; urges aid accessGround invasion in Gaza?

The arrest occurred due to possession of a fake resident card. Authorities took him into custody in Niagara Falls, New York. He faces a potential 10-year prison sentence. The arrest is part of 'Operation Take Back America'. This initiative targets illegal immigration.  An Indian national has been arrested in the United States for allegedly possessing a forged alien resident card, according to the Justice Department. Swapnil Ramesh Tejale, 34, was taken into custody following a traffic stop in Niagara Falls, New York, and now faces a federal charge that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.“On July 10, 2025, the Niagara Falls Border Patrol Station received a request from the Niagara Falls Police Department to help identify three individuals that they had encountered during a traffic stop,” said Assistant US Attorney Michael J. Smith, who is prosecuting the case. “Agents arrived at the scene and questioned the three individuals as to their citizenship. Tejale presented a Lawful Permanent Resident Card but voluntarily admitted that the card was fictitious.”Authorities later confirmed that Tejale was in the country unlawfully and did not possess any valid immigration documents. Following his arrest, agents discovered a Social Security card in his name, which was also found to be counterfeit.The case falls under “Operation Take Back America”, a Justice Department initiative aimed at tackling illegal immigration and dismantling transnational criminal organisations. The operation seeks to “repel the invasion of illegal immigration” and “protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime”, the department said.The investigation was led by the US Border Patrol Niagara Falls Station, under the direction of Patrol Agent in Charge Brady Waikal.Tejale’s arrest is part of a series of immigration enforcement actions involving Indian nationals this year. In a related incident, an Indian man from Santa Rosa, California, was sentenced in March to six months in prison for conspiracy to transport aliens for profit. Meanwhile, Manjot Singh, a 25-year-old Indian national, was recently arrested in the Seattle area for repeat offences including robbery, assault, and criminal impersonation. Singh, who entered the U.S. illegally, is currently in ICE custody pending deportation.ICE officials have said that Singh’s arrest is a warning to repeat offenders: “Those who violate US laws while in the country illegally face arrest and deportation.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Viral footage shows firefighters inspecting the scene as the family performed the ritual. (Photo: X) A housewarming ceremony involving a Hindu havan at a Texas home took an unexpected turn when local firefighters arrived at the scene, mistaking the ritual for a fire emergency.The incident was captured on video. The footage has gone viral and has fuelled an online debate over cultural awareness and fire safety. The clip was originally shared on Instagram. It shows a fire truck from the Bedford fire department pulling up outside the house as smoke from the ceremony fills the garage. Inside, an Indian family can be seen performing a traditional havan, a religious ritual involving fire, as part of their housewarming puja.The video includes on-screen text stating, "Cultural misunderstanding 101: A Hindu puja is not a fire emergency. When you're having a housewarming havan and the fire department pulls up."Shortly after the fire crew arrives, they are seen speaking with members of the family and inspecting the area. However, it remains unclear whether any formal action was taken or if any fire codes were violated during the ritual.The footage has since been widely circulated across social media platforms, with users offering differing views on the incident. Some social media users criticised the family for conducting a ritual involving fire in a residential setting, arguing it could pose safety risks. Others defended the family’s right to observe their religious customs, calling the incident a clear example of cultural misunderstanding.No official comment was immeditaely released by the Bedford fire department.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Indian-origin Mathura Sridharan was appointed as Ohio's 12th solicitor general, inviting the wrath of online trolls who questioned why a 'non-US-origin' person was not picked for the post. Sridharan's LinkedIn went viral as critics questioned her credibility -- forcing Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost to issue a clarification, or a clapback at the trolls. Dave Yost, who announced Mathura's promotion, said Mathura is wrongly being portrayed as a non-American. "A few commenters have asserted incorrectly that Mathura is not American. She is a United States citizen, married to a US citizen, and the child of naturalized US citizens," he said. "If her name or her complexion bother you, the problem is not with her or her appointment," he added."Mathura is brilliant… she won her argument at SCOTUS last year. Both the SGs she worked under (Flowers & Gaiser) recommended her. I told her when I originally hired her I needed her to argue with me. She does… All the time! Excited to promote her. She will serve Ohio well," Yost wrote.Yost's clapback also met trolling as people commented that she is not "American-American". "Is she a Christian? That’s the biggest factor that concerns me. Based on the bindi on her forehead, I worry she is not," one wrote. "Another American job… given away to foreigners," another wrote. "She's Indian. They all have a loyalty first to other Indians. horrible pick. Totally un-American. the GOP is pathetic," a third user wrote."No one with the last name 'Sridharan' fought in the US Civil War. She's not an American," another wrote.Before joining the Ohio Solicitor’s Office, Mathura clerked for Judge Steven J. Menashi of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and Judge Deborah A. Batts of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. She holds a Juris Doctor from New York University School of Law, a Master’s Degree in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as a Bachelor’s Degree in Economics and in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

News organizations like New Zealand Herald, Radio New Zealand, and 1News cited their inability to moderate the hateful content as the reason for shutting down comments.   After Indian-origin Nikhil Ravishankar was appointed as the new chief executive of Air New Zealand, the country's media said they had to disable comments on social media as there was a barrage of racist remarks targeting Ravishankar's ethnicity. Ravishankar was the chief digital officer of Air New Zealand before getting the major promotion which is the first for an Indian-origin person in the country.New Zealand Herald, Radio New Zealand, 1News said they had to disable comments as they can't allow hatred. The New Zealand Herald issued a statement in which it clarified that there were several racist comments owing to which they had to take the extreme step. "We appreciate the high level of interest in this story but cannot safely moderate it at this time," the news outlet said in a post in the comment thread."We want to foster a safe online community by reducing instances of hate, racism, abuse and misinformation. We welcome your feedback on articles but there has to be some parameters, and these are explained in our community house rules...We cannot tolerate hate. We cannot tolerate abuse towards individuals in our stories or other commenters," the company's social media policy says. Radio New Zealand had to do the same on the social media post on Ravishankar's appointment. "Under RNZ's comments policy, we will proactively disable comments on posts which may attract abusive or harmful comments or when resources are required elsewhere," a spokesperson for RNZ said. "In this instance, the comments were disabled after our monitoring found racist comments," the spokesperson said. "We want people to feel safe and respected on our community forums and will continue to proactively disable comments where necessary. We will not tolerate harmful communications."1News said it received a large number of comments on the post that announced Ravishankar's appointment and a vast majority were inappropriate. Who is Nikhil Ravishankar?Nikhil Ravishankar was born in India but brought up in New Zealand. He studied in New Zealand -- holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) from the University of Auckland. Before joining Air New Zealand, Ravishankar was Chief Digital Officer at Vector New Zealand (from 2017), and also worked as a Managing Director at Accenture across Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand, and in senior technology roles at Spark (formerly Telecom NZ).About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

After her TikTok video went viral, another ICE official offered help. Chatterjee highlights the broader issue of poor ICE communication, impacting immigrants facing detention and difficult bond policies, leading some to abandon their asylum claims. Trisha Chatterjee (Picture source: LinkedIn) Trisha Chatterjee, an Indian-origin immigration lawyer in Ohio, has alleged she was given the number of a Taco Bell outlet when she called ICE for urgent client support. Chatterjee posted about the incident on TikTok, where it went viral and ultimately led to help from another ICE official. But she says the larger issue lack of clear access to immigration authorities continues to cause serious harm to her clients."I called and they answered and they said, 'Hello, Taco Bell?' And I said, 'Taco Bell?' And the guy who was working said, 'Yeah, Taco Bell. Ma'am, you called me," Chatterjee recalled."I was in such disbelief," she said. "So, I called the ICE officer back, just really frustrated with what had just happened. He says, 'Oh, I'm sorry. I was trying to lighten the mood and make you laugh.'"ICE has denied the accusation. Homeland security called it a “lie and a smear.” Chatterjee stood by her version of events.Who is Trisha Chatterjee? Trisha Chatterjee is an Indian-origin immigration lawyer based in Greater Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio. She graduated from Miami University in 2020 and the University of Dayton School of Law in 2023.She works with the law office of Emily Feliz Garcia, a small immigration firm in Springdale. Before this, she worked at Abdallah law offices.For the last two years, she has handled immigration cases, especially those involving clients detained at the Butler County Jail in Ohio, which has a contract with ICE.Chatterjee was trying to submit "stay of removal" applications—urgent paperwork that can pause deportation for clients with pending immigration cases. ICE requires these to be submitted in person at the Detroit field office, but she hoped to file them locally in Blue Ash.After being unable to reach anyone by phone or email, she finally spoke to an ICE officer who gave her a phone number that turned out to be for Taco Bell. When she called back, the officer reportedly said he was trying to make her laugh.She posted a video about the incident on TikTok, which gained over 38,000 views. Many users sympathised, and one even helped her connect with a helpful ICE official in Blue Ash, who is now assisting her.Chatterjee said the larger problem is the lack of access and communication with ICE. She also highlighted how a stricter bond policy is making it harder for immigrants to stay out of detention during legal proceedings. Bonds can cost up to $50,000 and must be paid upfront.According to Chatterjee, some clients are abandoning their asylum cases or choosing to self-deport out of fear. She mentioned recent local arrests of people attending ICE check-ins, which has only deepened anxiety in immigrant communities.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The alleged abuse occurred in Contra Costa County, according to the district attorney’s office.Jennifer Powell, 45, has also been charged with 24 counts in a related felony complaint. Both Bhagwagar and Powell are being held at the Martinez detention facility. Bhagwagar’s bail has been set at $15 million.The charges in both cases carry possible prison terms of 15 years to life. Bhagwagar is expected to be arraigned Wednesday in Martinez, California.“Our office stands firmly committed to protecting children and holding those who cause harm accountable,” said Contra Costa county district attorney Diana Becton in a statement. “Every child deserves to feel safe, protected and heard when an injustice like this occurs.”According to the Contra Costa county sheriff’s office, detectives had been investigating Bhagwagar since April. His arrest was made with the assistance of Homeland Security Investigations after a warrant was issued.A short video published by aviation blog View From the Wing shows officers with badges exiting the plane’s cockpit.Delta Air Lines released a statement saying it was “appalled by reports of the charges related to the arrest” and confirmed that Bhagwagar had been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation. “Delta has zero tolerance for unlawful conduct,” the airline said.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani faces criticism for visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam due to his past support for defunding the police. Critics accuse Mamdani of shifting his stance for political gain, especially after his 2020 tweets resurfaced. Mamdani defends his actions, clarifying his current position on public safety and police funding. Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is facing backlash after visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam, as critics pointed to his past 2020 tweet supporting "defund the police" stance.The controversy erupted after Mamdani, who recently returned from a trip to Uganda, visited the grieving family of officer Islam, one of four victims killed in a mass shooting in Midtown Manhattan. Zohran Mamdani’s SECRET Wedding Triggers Fury Amid Local Tragedy | WATCHThe shooter, Shane Tamura, opened fire on Monday, killing Islam and three others before shooting himself.Sharing a post on X, Mamdani wrote: “Two days ago, an act of senseless violence took the lives of Officer Didarul Islam, Wesley LePatner, Aland Etienne, and Julia Hyman. Today, I visited Officer Islam's family and learned of his legacy. I ask you to join me in honoring the memory of these four New Yorkers.”However, the post quickly drew criticism, with users referencing Mamdani’s previous tweets during the height of the “Defund the Police” movement in 2020.Many accused him of changing his stance for political gain. One user wrote, “You can't go from defund the police to never mind I love the police. You're asking New Yorkers to forgo their guns meanwhile you just had a wedding in Uganda with armed guards.”While another posted, “Zohran Mamdani exposed as a total fraud. Mocking cops, calling them racist, then acting like he cares? No loyalty to America. He belongs in Uganda, not leading NYC. Deport him and protect our city!”Earlier at a press conference following his visit to the officer’s home in The Bronx, Mamdani addressed the criticism and attempted to clarify his position saying: “I am not defunding the police; I am not running to defund the police.”“Over the course of this race, I’ve been very clear about my view of public safety and the critical role that the police have in creating that public safety,” he added.Standing alongside members of the Bangladeshi American Police Association—of which Officer Islam was a member—and labor union 32BJ, which represented another victim, Aland Etienne, Mamdani tried to strike a unifying tone.During the peak of the "Defund the Police" movement in 2020, Zohran Mamdani repeatedly called for major cuts to the NYPD budget. In one post, he wrote, “We don’t need an investigation to know that the NYPD is racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety. What we need is to #DefundTheNYPD.”In another, he said, “There is no negotiating with an institution this wicked & corrupt. Defund it. Dismantle it. End the cycle of violence,” referencing budget talks around proposed NYPD cuts.Now, Mamdani has distanced himself from those remarks. When asked about them, he responded, “My statements in 2020 were made amidst a frustration that many New Yorkers held at the murder of George Floyd.”Mamdani claimed that his current stance is more nuanced, stating that his previous posts were “clearly out of step” with his recent campaign platform. He now supports maintaining the NYPD headcount while reducing its overtime budget.Despite this clarification, skepticism remains. Many police officers and political observers have accused Mamdani of shifting positions purely for political gain in a city where public safety remains a top concern for voters, New York Post reported.Adding to the political firestorm, former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams, who are both trailing Mamdani in early polling for the 2025 mayoral race, weighed in shortly after the shooting. Mamdani fired back, accusing Cuomo of politicising the tragedy saying, “It is beyond me that politicians are looking to use these days to score such cynical political points, on the very day that I held the father of Officer Islam in my arms and he could not utter a single word.”“For the former governor to spend an entire day speaking almost exclusively about me and barely about the New Yorkers who have been killed is indicative of the very politics New Yorkers want to leave in the past,” he added.All three, Mamdani, Cuomo, and Adams are expected to attend officer Islam’s funeral on Thursday.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The girl had visited Ramalingam’s store and returned later to buy ice cream. Prosecutors said he led her into a back area and forced her to perform oral sex. After the incident, the girl sought help from a passerby, who called the police.Ramalingam represented himself during the trial, which began on January 16. He was convicted on all charges on 7 July.“The fact that she had not run off after the first act of molest, or that she did not resist the assaults, or inform her grandfather, were all to my mind sufficiently explained, particularly given that she was still young and immature,” said Justice Aidan Xu, who found the girl’s account credible and consistent.Ramalingam’s earlier statements to police reportedly included admissions of hugging, kissing, and oral sex. However, he later denied any wrongdoing, claiming he was suffering from erectile dysfunction and that no DNA evidence was found on the victim.The judge ruled that these claims did not undermine the girl’s testimony. “While there was no dispute that Ramalingam suffered from erectile dysfunction, the prosecution’s expert witness gave a cogent explanation that oral rape remained possible,” Justice Xu was quoted as saying to Straits Times.Following sentencing on July 30, Ramalingam said he would appeal and was granted bail of S$80,000. He attempted to negotiate with the judge over the conditions, asking for the removal of his electronic tag and exemption from reporting to the Police Cantonment Complex. Both requests were denied.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The incidents, condemned by authorities and community leaders, are being treated as linked. This follows a separate racist assault in Adelaide, where an Indian man was brutally attacked after being told to "f--- off, Indian."  A Hindu temple in Melbourne’s eastern suburb of Boronia was defaced with racist graffiti this week prompting widespread condemnation and police investigation.As reported by The Brisbane Times and The Sydney Morning Herald, offensive red graffiti with the words “Go home” and other racial slurs were found daubed across the Shree Swaminarayan Temple on Wadhurst Drive, as well as two nearby Asian-operated restaurants Kingsland Chinese Restaurant and Charles King Dumpling.Police said a healing centre on Mountain Highway was also defaced the same night, bringing the total number of sites attacked to four. “There is absolutely no place at all in our society for hate-based and racist behaviour,” Victoria Police said in a statement. Authorities confirmed that all four incidents are being treated as linked and that an investigation is under way.PollShould harsher penalties be implemented for hate crimes?Yes, definitelyNo, current laws are sufficient'An attack on our right to worship'Makrand Bhagwat, President of the Hindu Council of Australia’s Victoria chapter, told Australia Today the vandalism of the temple was “heartbreaking” for the community. “Our temple is meant to be a sanctuary of peace, devotion and unity,” he said. “To have it targeted in this way feels like an attack on our identity, our right to worship and freedom of religion.”Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan sent a personal message of support to temple management. “What happened this week was hateful, racist and deeply disturbing,” she wrote. “It wasn’t just vandalism – it was a deliberate act of hate, designed to intimidate, isolate, and spread fear.”Local interfaith networks, including the City of Greater Knox’s Multifaith Network, have expressed support. “We want to show that love and solidarity triumph over hate,” said community leader Vikrant Thakur.Indian man targeted in racist attackThis came after a 23-year-old Indian man, Charanpreet Singh, was brutally attacked and left unconscious on a street in Adelaide following a reported racist assault linked to a parking dispute. According to 9News, the men allegedly told Singh to "f--- off, Indian" before launching a violent, unprovoked assault.“They just said ‘f--- off, Indian’, and after that they just started punching,” Singh said. “I tried to fight back, but they beat me until I was unconscious.”He sustained serious injuries, including brain trauma and facial fractures. A 20-year-old from Enfield was arrested and charged, but others involved remain at large.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Singh and his wife were allegedly ambushed by a group of men who shouted racial slurs before inflicting serious injuries. The incident has sparked outrage and renewed calls for enhanced safety measures for international students in the area.  An Indian international student has been hospitalised with serious injuries after a violent assault in Australia's Adelaide that is being investigated as a possible racially motivated attack. The incident has sparked outrage across the Indian community and renewed calls for better safety measures for international students.Charanpreet Singh, 23, was with his wife near Kintore Avenue on Saturday evening (July 19) when they were allegedly ambushed by a group of five men. According to Australia Today, the couple had just parked their car to view the city’s light displays around 9:22pm when the attackers emerged from another vehicle.Viral video shows assaultEyewitnesses and video footage shared on social media reportedly show the men striking Singh with what appeared to be metal knuckles or sharp objects, while shouting racial abuse including: “F--- off, Indian”. The attackers then fled the scene, leaving Singh unconscious and seriously injured on the road.PollWhat should be prioritized to improve safety for international students?Awareness campaigns and community supportStronger law enforcement and quicker actionSingh, who spoke to 9News from his hospital bed, said the altercation began over a car parking dispute but escalated into a racially charged assault. “They just said, ‘F--- off, Indian,’ and after that they just started punching,” he recalled. “You can change anything in your body, but you can’t change the colours.”He sustained facial fractures and brain trauma, and was taken by emergency services to the Royal Adelaide Hospital for overnight treatment. The assault has left members of the local Indian community shaken, with many expressing solidarity with Singh online.“When things like this happen, it makes you feel like you should go back,” Singh said.Police investigation under waySouth Australia Police confirmed they were called to Kintore Avenue shortly before 9.30pm and found Singh with facial injuries. “He was taken to hospital for treatment. Investigations are continuing,” a police spokesperson told The Indian Sun. One man, a 20-year-old from Enfield, has been arrested and charged with assault causing harm. The other suspects remain at large.Authorities are reviewing CCTV footage from the area and have urged witnesses to come forward. “We ask anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers,” the police said.Premier Peter Malinauskas has condemned the incident, calling it “completely unwelcome in our state”. He added, “Any time we see any evidence of any racial attack, it is just not consistent with where the majority of our community are at.”Another attack in DublinThis follows another attack targeting an Indian individual. An Indian man in his 40s was hospitalised after being brutally attacked by a group of teenage boys in a violent, racist assault in Dublin on Saturday evening. The gang falsely accused him of inappropriate behaviour with children before beating him and pulling down his trousers. “Gardaí in Tallaght were alerted to an incident at Parkhill Road... Investigations are ongoing,” police said. Councillor Baby Pereppadan said, “He couldn’t speak much because of the shock.” Sinn Féin’s Seán Crowe added, “You are sowing hate, fear, and division.” A protest is planned for July 26 to condemn rising racist violence in Ireland.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Gita Gopinath (File photo) NEW DELHI: Gita Gopinath, the second-in-command at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), will step down at the end of August to return to her position at Harvard University, the IMF announced on Monday.The timing of Gita Gopinath’s exit has taken many within the IMF by surprise and is believed to have been prompted by her own decision, reported news agency Reuters. Having originally left Harvard to serve at the Fund, she is now set to resume her role as professor of economics at the university. Her departure opens a window for the US Treasury to propose a successor—an opportunity that comes as President Donald Trump pushes to reshape global trade dynamics and curb the country’s persistent trade deficits through sweeping tariffs on imports worldwide. Gopinath, who joined the IMF in 2019 as its first-ever female chief economist, was elevated to First Deputy Managing Director in January 2022. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva will appoint her successor “in due course,” the statement added.Gopinath had served as the first female chief economist of the Washington-based global lender for three years. Gopinath's research has been published in many top economics journals. Prior to her appointment as IMF Chief Economist, she was the John Zwaanstra Professor of International Studies and Economics in the economics department of Harvard University. Before joining the faculty of Harvard University in 2005, she was an assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.Gopinath, who considers herself a product of the Indian education system, she completed her schooling in Mysuru. She had her first brush with macro-economic challenges while doing her bachelor’s degree at Lady Shri Ram College, Delhi, with India experiencing its first major external financing and currency crisis in 1990-91. “This inspired me to pursue graduate work in economics and was the foundation for my interest in international finance,” she had told in an interview in 2010.Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.AI Masterclass for Students.

One of the group took his metal water bottle and hit him above the eye, causing heavy bleeding. He was taken to hospital where he received eight stitches. Gardaí confirmed they are investigating the assault and his injuries are “non-life threatening”.An Indian-origin woman has put a post on Reddit saying her 60-year-old father was harassed by boys, aged around seven and eight, who tried to take his wallet at a bus stop in Dublin on Aug 9.These are just the latest in a string of racist attacks targeting Indians in Ireland which have left the Indian community terrified to step outside.India Day in Ireland, which celebrates the country’s cultural ties, has been postponed this Sunday owing to the wave of hate crimes. The event has been organised by the Ireland India Council since 2015. A Ficci India Day event is going ahead in Dublin on Aug 17.Indian community leaders met Ireland deputy PM Simon Harris on Monday after which he condemned the “despicable acts of violence and racism”.Chairman of the Ireland India Council Prashant Shukla told Ireland AM: “We weren’t worried about the event itself as the Gardaí assured us about safety, but we were worried about the perception it could lead to further attacks. Our message to the Irish community is that these attacks are attacks on your economy and industry. Policing needs to go to the next level. I feel there are not proper investigations and arrests. We are all working, paying taxes and contributing to the economy. No one is getting a free house. People are spreading misinformation that Indians buying houses is causing house prices to go up.”President of Ireland Michael D Higgins on Tuesday also condemned the attacks. “A lot of Indians are reconsidering their choices and may move back to India if the situation doesn’t improve. It is mostly being caused by far-right groups encouraging teenagers to attack immigrants. Indians are the most visible immigrants here,” said Indian national Some Aditya Mandal, who has worked in Dublin for eight years.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle10 baby names that mean creativity and visionLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?Maharashtra’s UNESCO World Heritage Sites and other iconic monuments for history loversRajinikanth completes 50 years in cinema: Lesser-known facts about the ‘Coolie’ star6 lizards that prove reptiles can be adorableHow to unrot your brain: 5 effective steps to sharpen focus and boost mental clarityFrom Mullum Malarum to Kabali: Rajinikanth’s most emotional movies that fans still cherish123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

Dr Ajay Aggarwal, an Indian-origin pain medicine doctor from Houston, has agreed to pay over $2 million to resolve allegations of medical fraud against him, the US Justice Department revealed. Between 2021 and 2023, the 63-year-old doctor billed federally funded health care programs like Medicare and the Department of Labor’s Workers’ Compensation Programs for surgical implants that he never performed. Dr Aggarwal received thousands of dollars per procedure, but patients received simple devices which required no surgery. And all device placements used to take place at Aggarwal's clinic, not a hospital or surgical center. “A doctor who uses simple medical devices on his patients, yet bills Medicare for a sophisticated spinal surgery, is billing the American taxpayer, plain and simple,” said US Attorney Nicholas J Ganjei.. “The Southern District of Texas will ensure that losses to federally funded healthcare programs from fraudulent billing, like what happened here, are recouped and that wrongdoers are held accountable.”PollDoes the healthcare billing system need stricter monitoring to prevent fraud?YesNoA 2023 document of the DOJ revealed that earlier he was accused of giving unnecessary treatment to federal employees with federal workers' compensation benefits and his pharmacy Medley, which was officially owned by his wife, filed the prescriptions. An employee of Medley acted as a whistleblower and said that during his term of employment, he saw patients being sent unnecessary with unnecessary medications being prescribed. In some cases, the patients did not even see or meet Dr Aggarwal. And Medley employees were allegedly instructed to auto-fill medications on a monthly basis and to use pre-printed prescription pads to submit the prescriptions to DOL-OWCP without consideration of medical need. The new fraud of Dr Aggarwal came to be reported at a time when foreign doctors are under fire, while several Republican leaders said US needs more doctors and foreign doctors can fill the gap.

Indian-origin foreign nationals holding an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card could now lose it if they face serious criminal charges or convictions, the government has announced.In a fresh gazette notification, the ministry of home affairs said that the OCI registration will be cancelled if the holder is sentenced to imprisonment for two years or more, or is named in a charge sheet for an offence carrying a jail term of seven years or more."In exercise of the powers conferred by the clause (da) of section 7D of the Citizenship Act, 1955 (57 of 1955), the central government hereby states that an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) registration shall be liable to get cancelled when a person has been sentenced to imprisonment for term of not less than two years or has been charge-sheeted for an offence entailing punishment of imprisonment for seven years or more," the notification said, as cited by PTI.PollShould stricter rules be applied to Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) cardholders?NoYesThe OCI card allows Indian-origin foreign nationals to visit India without a visa. The scheme, introduced in August 2005, enables registration as OCI for all persons of Indian origin who were citizens of India on January 26, 1950 or later, or were eligible to become citizens on that date, except for those who are, or have been, citizens of Pakistan, Bangladesh or any other country specified by the government in the official gazette.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Indian-origin Dr Vinay Prasad returns to FDA weeks after exit
Dr Vinay Prasad, previously ousted from his FDA vaccine chief position due to criticism from Laura Loomer over past anti-Trump comments and drug approval decisions, has been reinstated. This unusual move suggests the influence of RFK Jr within the Trump administration despite pressure from right-wing activists. RFK Jr opposed anti-vaxxer Dr Prasad's exit and remained invested to bring him back.

This unusual move suggests the influence of RFK Jr within the Trump administration despite pressure from right-wing activists. RFK Jr opposed anti-vaxxer Dr Prasad's exit and remained invested to bring him back.  Dr Vinay Prasad is back at his FDA job weeks after exit that was prompted by right-wing activist Laura Loomer's campaigning against Prasad. Dr Vinay Prasad, the Indian-origin vaccine chief of the FDA who was forced to resign in July after far-right activist Laura Loomer led a campaign against him, has been reinstated to his job in an unusual instance. Laura Loomer pointed out the critical comments that Dr Prasad made about President Donald Trump before joining the administration, while some of his decisions to deny drug approvals also came under fire. A Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson confirmed to the New York Times that Dr Prasad is returning to the agency. “At the F.D.A.’s request, Dr. Vinay Prasad is resuming leadership of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research,” Andrew Nixon, a health department spokesman, said in a statement.The NYT report observed that Dr Prasad's rehiring suggests that the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr., and the FDA commissioner, Dr Marty Makary, remain influential enough in the Trump administration to employ someone who had previously expressed disdain for Trump and his followers.Loomer reacted to the reinstatement and called in another "egregious personnel decision". "In another egregious personnel decision under the Trump administration, it is now being reported that longtime progressive Marxist Vinay Prasad who referred to President Trump’s supporters as criminals and compared them to drug addicts after saying he stabbed a Trump voodoo doll to “curse Trump” is apparently back at FDA," Loomer wrote.RFK Jr tapped Dr Prasad in May when the previous head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation left the role. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Dr Prasad gained prominence as an outspoken critic of vaccines and mask mandate. In his short stint at the FDA since May, Dr Prasad limited the use of Covid-19 vaccines and promoted warnings about a rare side effect of the vaccines. When he resigned from his role weeks ago, a department spokesperson told the NYT: "Dr. Prasad did not want to be a distraction to the great work of the FDA in the Trump administration and has decided to return to California and spend more time with his family."Kennedy, however, opposed Prasad's departure from the role and remained invested in bringing him back. Dr Prasad was born and brought up in Ohio and Chicago to Indian immigrant parents.

An Indian-origin techie, Manasi Mishra, who graduated with a computer science degree from Purdue University, revealed in a TikTok video as she was getting ready that the only company that called her for an interview was Chipotle. Titled 'Chipotle Interview GRWM', the TikTok video went viral as she appealed 'somebody pls hire me'. In an interview with New York Times, after the video went viral, Mishra revealed that growing up near Silicon Valley, she was used to the narrative that if she learned to code, worked hard and studied computer science, she could get a six-figure starting salary. But recent graduates are finding it hard because of the spread of AI programming tools and also the recent layoffs at companies like Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft.The NYT story confirmed that Mishra did not get the burrito-making gig at Chipotle, and she finally found a sales position job at a tech company.Mishra's story and the NYT article triggered a major debate on the present job situation, layoff and how much of it should be blamed on foreign workers, AI etc. "This is why I really do feel for Gen Z. This young woman was told her whole life by every authority figure that she should study hard, do well in school, and pursue a career in tech. She went to Purdue, one of the best engineering schools in the country. She studied computer science, not gender ideology or basket weaving," one viral comment read on X. "And still she could not even get a job at Chipotle let alone in her field. She did literally everything “right” but, to what end? This situation is not sustainable. H1B and other work visas, as well as offshoring, are getting out of control and abusive. Policymakers should care about the young generation," the person wrote. Many people commented that the jobs that the Indian-origin person missed must have gone to people from India who are on H-1B.

(Photo: DailyEcho/Padharo) Ankit Vaghela, an Indian-origin restaurant owner in Southampton, was told by the police that they could not come to his 'Padharo' when he called 999 to report a break-in. The vandals broke in and fled with several bottles of expensive alcohol and cash but the police helpline asked them to email the CCTV footage of the three burglars who broke in last week.Vaghela decided to get proactive and review the footage first. He discovered his cash register without the cash, abandoned along with some smashed liquor bottles strewn on a nearby road. “It was very heartbreaking to be told that officers will be able to review the damage in three to five working days and that no forensics was available at the time,” said Vaghela.“There was glass everywhere. As a business, we can’t afford to remain closed and had to get things cleaned up and the glass fixed. We are still struggling to operate smoothly without a proper cash register, which will take time, but are determined to welcome our guests with the same level of service we are known for in the city,” he said.The Hampshire Police said they did not underestimate the July 31 case but they understood that their investigation could start without their immediate attendance at the site, as the offenders were not there. “Every deployment decision is based on informed risk assessments to make sure the most serious cases are prioritised, and officers are on scene where there is an immediate threat to life or a crime in action,” the police force said in a statement.“On this occasion, based on the initial information we were given regarding the offenders no longer being at the scene, our investigation could get underway without any immediate attendance. That investigation is progressing with lines of enquiry identified, such as CCTV, and we are in touch with the victim to provide them updates on our investigation,” added the statement, along with an appeal to the public for any information related to the burglary."It means nothing now, the damage is done. Officers were not willing to visit the restaurant," Vaghela told to local news outlets.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

In a separate incident, Laxman Das, an Indian sous chef in Dublin, was attacked and robbed while going to work. These incidents follow a series of recent assaults targeting Indians in Ireland, raising concerns about racism.  TOI correspondent from London: A six-year-old Indian-origin girl and an Indian sous chef are the latest victims in the ongoing spate of racist attacks targeting Indian nationals and Indian-origin Irish people in Ireland.The girl, whose family hail from Kottayam, Kerala, was playing outside her house in Waterford City, southeast Ireland, with friends at 7.30pm on Monday evening when a gang of boys and one girl called her a “dirty Indian” and told her to “go back to India”. She was born in Ireland. Five of the gang also punched her in the face, hit her private parts with a bicycle, punched her neck and twisted her hair.Her mother moved to Ireland eight years ago from Kottayam to work as a nurse with her husband and recently became an Irish citizen.The mother said the gang was made up of boys aged 12 to 14 and a girl aged eight. She said her daughter came home in floods of tears and is now too scared to play outside. She told the Irish Mirror: “I never expected that such an incident would happen. I thought she would be safe here. Even in front of our own house she can’t play safely. I am a nurse, I am doing my best to take care of people. I do my work and I am 100% professional. I changed my citizenship, but still we are called dirty people and even my kids are not safe. We came here to fill a labour gap. We are professionals — we have all the certificates…”The mother studied BSc Nursing at University of Calicut and went to Mount Carmel Higher Secondary School in Kottayam.“Gardaí (Irish national police) responded to a report of an alleged assault in the Kilbarry area of Waterford city on the evening of Monday 4 August. Investigations are ongoing,” a Garda spokesperson told TOI.On Wednesday morning Laxman Das from Kolkata, who works as a sous chef at the Anantara The Marker Dublin hotel, was assaulted near the Hilton Hotel by three people while on his way to work. He was taken to St Vincent's University Hospital. His phone, cash and electric bike were stolen.These come following a spate of attacks against Indians in Ireland in recent weeks — on July 19, July 24, July 27, and on Aug 1 when a cab driver was assaulted.The Gardaí said they are still investigating these attacks and no one has been arrested.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning looks of Binny Sebastiantv10 baby names that mean ‘divine light’ or ‘sacred glow’Lifestyle10 Birds with the "wildest dating rituals"LifestyleRaksha Bandhan: 10 iconic lines of famous Hindi poets that capture essence of the festivalLifestyleKarishma Tanna Stuns with Style and SpiritEntertainmentFrom Moong to Chia Sprouts: How to grow your breakfast in balconyLifestyleBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Here’s how much each contestant earns dailytv10 creatures that survive in the deepest parts of the oceanLifestyleRaksha Bandhan: 10 quotes that describe the beautiful bond between brothers and sistersLifestyleHow to do step-by-step Ayurveda hair therapy at homeLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Threads of Love, Threads of Tradition: How different Indian states celebrate Raksha BandhanFrom chapatis to cake: 7 delicious ways to use overripe bananasInternational Cat Day 2025: From Persian to Bengal Cat-- 5 most beautiful and popular pet cat breeds in the world5 diseases moles on your body might indicate and should not be ignoredNot-so popular drinks that help in weightloss10 places in South Africa that aren’t to be missed in a lifetimeMemorable style outings of Princess CharlotteHow Kangana Ranaut turned fame into fearless politicsFrom ₹6 Lakh to ₹40 Lakh: A peek into Kamal Haasan’s ultra-luxe watch closetFrom Archana reacting to a hate comment to son Aaryamann revealing how he impressed girlfriend Yogita Bihani: Archana Puran Singh shares candid moments123Hot PicksGlobal Standard indexUS stocks todayIndia-US tariffIntel CEOMukesh AmbaniUS jobless dataRussia crude oilTop TrendingTom BradyDonald TrumpSouth Park EpisodeCall of DutyMalik BeasleyBattlefield 6 Beta OpensPrivate School in IndianaLuka Doncic Weight LossLinda McMahonLakers RumorsTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteUAE launches national programme to train Emiratis in space mission design and satellite engineering'PM Modi can't, shouldn't bend knee to Donald Trump': US tariffs on India draws rare bipartisan concern in US - watch'Enormous mistake': What Trump's former NSA John Bolton said on India tariffChild assault under false identity: Indian man commits suicide in US jail months after 35-year prison sentence, claim reportsLove gone wild: Indian man faces deportation for harassing UK zoo colleague for 6 months; didn’t stop even after restraining order'Before judging...': Wife of Pakistani man Salman Iftikhar who threatened Virgin Atlantic air hostess with gangrape defends outburstFriedrich Merz halts German military exports to Israel over Gaza issue; urges aid accessGround invasion in Gaza?

The arrest occurred due to possession of a fake resident card. Authorities took him into custody in Niagara Falls, New York. He faces a potential 10-year prison sentence. The arrest is part of 'Operation Take Back America'. This initiative targets illegal immigration.  An Indian national has been arrested in the United States for allegedly possessing a forged alien resident card, according to the Justice Department. Swapnil Ramesh Tejale, 34, was taken into custody following a traffic stop in Niagara Falls, New York, and now faces a federal charge that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.“On July 10, 2025, the Niagara Falls Border Patrol Station received a request from the Niagara Falls Police Department to help identify three individuals that they had encountered during a traffic stop,” said Assistant US Attorney Michael J. Smith, who is prosecuting the case. “Agents arrived at the scene and questioned the three individuals as to their citizenship. Tejale presented a Lawful Permanent Resident Card but voluntarily admitted that the card was fictitious.”Authorities later confirmed that Tejale was in the country unlawfully and did not possess any valid immigration documents. Following his arrest, agents discovered a Social Security card in his name, which was also found to be counterfeit.The case falls under “Operation Take Back America”, a Justice Department initiative aimed at tackling illegal immigration and dismantling transnational criminal organisations. The operation seeks to “repel the invasion of illegal immigration” and “protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime”, the department said.The investigation was led by the US Border Patrol Niagara Falls Station, under the direction of Patrol Agent in Charge Brady Waikal.Tejale’s arrest is part of a series of immigration enforcement actions involving Indian nationals this year. In a related incident, an Indian man from Santa Rosa, California, was sentenced in March to six months in prison for conspiracy to transport aliens for profit. Meanwhile, Manjot Singh, a 25-year-old Indian national, was recently arrested in the Seattle area for repeat offences including robbery, assault, and criminal impersonation. Singh, who entered the U.S. illegally, is currently in ICE custody pending deportation.ICE officials have said that Singh’s arrest is a warning to repeat offenders: “Those who violate US laws while in the country illegally face arrest and deportation.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Viral footage shows firefighters inspecting the scene as the family performed the ritual. (Photo: X) A housewarming ceremony involving a Hindu havan at a Texas home took an unexpected turn when local firefighters arrived at the scene, mistaking the ritual for a fire emergency.The incident was captured on video. The footage has gone viral and has fuelled an online debate over cultural awareness and fire safety. The clip was originally shared on Instagram. It shows a fire truck from the Bedford fire department pulling up outside the house as smoke from the ceremony fills the garage. Inside, an Indian family can be seen performing a traditional havan, a religious ritual involving fire, as part of their housewarming puja.The video includes on-screen text stating, "Cultural misunderstanding 101: A Hindu puja is not a fire emergency. When you're having a housewarming havan and the fire department pulls up."Shortly after the fire crew arrives, they are seen speaking with members of the family and inspecting the area. However, it remains unclear whether any formal action was taken or if any fire codes were violated during the ritual.The footage has since been widely circulated across social media platforms, with users offering differing views on the incident. Some social media users criticised the family for conducting a ritual involving fire in a residential setting, arguing it could pose safety risks. Others defended the family’s right to observe their religious customs, calling the incident a clear example of cultural misunderstanding.No official comment was immeditaely released by the Bedford fire department.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Indian-origin Mathura Sridharan was appointed as Ohio's 12th solicitor general, inviting the wrath of online trolls who questioned why a 'non-US-origin' person was not picked for the post. Sridharan's LinkedIn went viral as critics questioned her credibility -- forcing Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost to issue a clarification, or a clapback at the trolls. Dave Yost, who announced Mathura's promotion, said Mathura is wrongly being portrayed as a non-American. "A few commenters have asserted incorrectly that Mathura is not American. She is a United States citizen, married to a US citizen, and the child of naturalized US citizens," he said. "If her name or her complexion bother you, the problem is not with her or her appointment," he added."Mathura is brilliant… she won her argument at SCOTUS last year. Both the SGs she worked under (Flowers & Gaiser) recommended her. I told her when I originally hired her I needed her to argue with me. She does… All the time! Excited to promote her. She will serve Ohio well," Yost wrote.Yost's clapback also met trolling as people commented that she is not "American-American". "Is she a Christian? That’s the biggest factor that concerns me. Based on the bindi on her forehead, I worry she is not," one wrote. "Another American job… given away to foreigners," another wrote. "She's Indian. They all have a loyalty first to other Indians. horrible pick. Totally un-American. the GOP is pathetic," a third user wrote."No one with the last name 'Sridharan' fought in the US Civil War. She's not an American," another wrote.Before joining the Ohio Solicitor’s Office, Mathura clerked for Judge Steven J. Menashi of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and Judge Deborah A. Batts of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. She holds a Juris Doctor from New York University School of Law, a Master’s Degree in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as a Bachelor’s Degree in Economics and in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

News organizations like New Zealand Herald, Radio New Zealand, and 1News cited their inability to moderate the hateful content as the reason for shutting down comments.   After Indian-origin Nikhil Ravishankar was appointed as the new chief executive of Air New Zealand, the country's media said they had to disable comments on social media as there was a barrage of racist remarks targeting Ravishankar's ethnicity. Ravishankar was the chief digital officer of Air New Zealand before getting the major promotion which is the first for an Indian-origin person in the country.New Zealand Herald, Radio New Zealand, 1News said they had to disable comments as they can't allow hatred. The New Zealand Herald issued a statement in which it clarified that there were several racist comments owing to which they had to take the extreme step. "We appreciate the high level of interest in this story but cannot safely moderate it at this time," the news outlet said in a post in the comment thread."We want to foster a safe online community by reducing instances of hate, racism, abuse and misinformation. We welcome your feedback on articles but there has to be some parameters, and these are explained in our community house rules...We cannot tolerate hate. We cannot tolerate abuse towards individuals in our stories or other commenters," the company's social media policy says. Radio New Zealand had to do the same on the social media post on Ravishankar's appointment. "Under RNZ's comments policy, we will proactively disable comments on posts which may attract abusive or harmful comments or when resources are required elsewhere," a spokesperson for RNZ said. "In this instance, the comments were disabled after our monitoring found racist comments," the spokesperson said. "We want people to feel safe and respected on our community forums and will continue to proactively disable comments where necessary. We will not tolerate harmful communications."1News said it received a large number of comments on the post that announced Ravishankar's appointment and a vast majority were inappropriate. Who is Nikhil Ravishankar?Nikhil Ravishankar was born in India but brought up in New Zealand. He studied in New Zealand -- holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) from the University of Auckland. Before joining Air New Zealand, Ravishankar was Chief Digital Officer at Vector New Zealand (from 2017), and also worked as a Managing Director at Accenture across Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand, and in senior technology roles at Spark (formerly Telecom NZ).About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

After her TikTok video went viral, another ICE official offered help. Chatterjee highlights the broader issue of poor ICE communication, impacting immigrants facing detention and difficult bond policies, leading some to abandon their asylum claims. Trisha Chatterjee (Picture source: LinkedIn) Trisha Chatterjee, an Indian-origin immigration lawyer in Ohio, has alleged she was given the number of a Taco Bell outlet when she called ICE for urgent client support. Chatterjee posted about the incident on TikTok, where it went viral and ultimately led to help from another ICE official. But she says the larger issue lack of clear access to immigration authorities continues to cause serious harm to her clients."I called and they answered and they said, 'Hello, Taco Bell?' And I said, 'Taco Bell?' And the guy who was working said, 'Yeah, Taco Bell. Ma'am, you called me," Chatterjee recalled."I was in such disbelief," she said. "So, I called the ICE officer back, just really frustrated with what had just happened. He says, 'Oh, I'm sorry. I was trying to lighten the mood and make you laugh.'"ICE has denied the accusation. Homeland security called it a “lie and a smear.” Chatterjee stood by her version of events.Who is Trisha Chatterjee? Trisha Chatterjee is an Indian-origin immigration lawyer based in Greater Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio. She graduated from Miami University in 2020 and the University of Dayton School of Law in 2023.She works with the law office of Emily Feliz Garcia, a small immigration firm in Springdale. Before this, she worked at Abdallah law offices.For the last two years, she has handled immigration cases, especially those involving clients detained at the Butler County Jail in Ohio, which has a contract with ICE.Chatterjee was trying to submit "stay of removal" applications—urgent paperwork that can pause deportation for clients with pending immigration cases. ICE requires these to be submitted in person at the Detroit field office, but she hoped to file them locally in Blue Ash.After being unable to reach anyone by phone or email, she finally spoke to an ICE officer who gave her a phone number that turned out to be for Taco Bell. When she called back, the officer reportedly said he was trying to make her laugh.She posted a video about the incident on TikTok, which gained over 38,000 views. Many users sympathised, and one even helped her connect with a helpful ICE official in Blue Ash, who is now assisting her.Chatterjee said the larger problem is the lack of access and communication with ICE. She also highlighted how a stricter bond policy is making it harder for immigrants to stay out of detention during legal proceedings. Bonds can cost up to $50,000 and must be paid upfront.According to Chatterjee, some clients are abandoning their asylum cases or choosing to self-deport out of fear. She mentioned recent local arrests of people attending ICE check-ins, which has only deepened anxiety in immigrant communities.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The alleged abuse occurred in Contra Costa County, according to the district attorney’s office.Jennifer Powell, 45, has also been charged with 24 counts in a related felony complaint. Both Bhagwagar and Powell are being held at the Martinez detention facility. Bhagwagar’s bail has been set at $15 million.The charges in both cases carry possible prison terms of 15 years to life. Bhagwagar is expected to be arraigned Wednesday in Martinez, California.“Our office stands firmly committed to protecting children and holding those who cause harm accountable,” said Contra Costa county district attorney Diana Becton in a statement. “Every child deserves to feel safe, protected and heard when an injustice like this occurs.”According to the Contra Costa county sheriff’s office, detectives had been investigating Bhagwagar since April. His arrest was made with the assistance of Homeland Security Investigations after a warrant was issued.A short video published by aviation blog View From the Wing shows officers with badges exiting the plane’s cockpit.Delta Air Lines released a statement saying it was “appalled by reports of the charges related to the arrest” and confirmed that Bhagwagar had been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation. “Delta has zero tolerance for unlawful conduct,” the airline said.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani faces criticism for visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam due to his past support for defunding the police. Critics accuse Mamdani of shifting his stance for political gain, especially after his 2020 tweets resurfaced. Mamdani defends his actions, clarifying his current position on public safety and police funding. Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is facing backlash after visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam, as critics pointed to his past 2020 tweet supporting "defund the police" stance.The controversy erupted after Mamdani, who recently returned from a trip to Uganda, visited the grieving family of officer Islam, one of four victims killed in a mass shooting in Midtown Manhattan. Zohran Mamdani’s SECRET Wedding Triggers Fury Amid Local Tragedy | WATCHThe shooter, Shane Tamura, opened fire on Monday, killing Islam and three others before shooting himself.Sharing a post on X, Mamdani wrote: “Two days ago, an act of senseless violence took the lives of Officer Didarul Islam, Wesley LePatner, Aland Etienne, and Julia Hyman. Today, I visited Officer Islam's family and learned of his legacy. I ask you to join me in honoring the memory of these four New Yorkers.”However, the post quickly drew criticism, with users referencing Mamdani’s previous tweets during the height of the “Defund the Police” movement in 2020.Many accused him of changing his stance for political gain. One user wrote, “You can't go from defund the police to never mind I love the police. You're asking New Yorkers to forgo their guns meanwhile you just had a wedding in Uganda with armed guards.”While another posted, “Zohran Mamdani exposed as a total fraud. Mocking cops, calling them racist, then acting like he cares? No loyalty to America. He belongs in Uganda, not leading NYC. Deport him and protect our city!”Earlier at a press conference following his visit to the officer’s home in The Bronx, Mamdani addressed the criticism and attempted to clarify his position saying: “I am not defunding the police; I am not running to defund the police.”“Over the course of this race, I’ve been very clear about my view of public safety and the critical role that the police have in creating that public safety,” he added.Standing alongside members of the Bangladeshi American Police Association—of which Officer Islam was a member—and labor union 32BJ, which represented another victim, Aland Etienne, Mamdani tried to strike a unifying tone.During the peak of the "Defund the Police" movement in 2020, Zohran Mamdani repeatedly called for major cuts to the NYPD budget. In one post, he wrote, “We don’t need an investigation to know that the NYPD is racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety. What we need is to #DefundTheNYPD.”In another, he said, “There is no negotiating with an institution this wicked & corrupt. Defund it. Dismantle it. End the cycle of violence,” referencing budget talks around proposed NYPD cuts.Now, Mamdani has distanced himself from those remarks. When asked about them, he responded, “My statements in 2020 were made amidst a frustration that many New Yorkers held at the murder of George Floyd.”Mamdani claimed that his current stance is more nuanced, stating that his previous posts were “clearly out of step” with his recent campaign platform. He now supports maintaining the NYPD headcount while reducing its overtime budget.Despite this clarification, skepticism remains. Many police officers and political observers have accused Mamdani of shifting positions purely for political gain in a city where public safety remains a top concern for voters, New York Post reported.Adding to the political firestorm, former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams, who are both trailing Mamdani in early polling for the 2025 mayoral race, weighed in shortly after the shooting. Mamdani fired back, accusing Cuomo of politicising the tragedy saying, “It is beyond me that politicians are looking to use these days to score such cynical political points, on the very day that I held the father of Officer Islam in my arms and he could not utter a single word.”“For the former governor to spend an entire day speaking almost exclusively about me and barely about the New Yorkers who have been killed is indicative of the very politics New Yorkers want to leave in the past,” he added.All three, Mamdani, Cuomo, and Adams are expected to attend officer Islam’s funeral on Thursday.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The girl had visited Ramalingam’s store and returned later to buy ice cream. Prosecutors said he led her into a back area and forced her to perform oral sex. After the incident, the girl sought help from a passerby, who called the police.Ramalingam represented himself during the trial, which began on January 16. He was convicted on all charges on 7 July.“The fact that she had not run off after the first act of molest, or that she did not resist the assaults, or inform her grandfather, were all to my mind sufficiently explained, particularly given that she was still young and immature,” said Justice Aidan Xu, who found the girl’s account credible and consistent.Ramalingam’s earlier statements to police reportedly included admissions of hugging, kissing, and oral sex. However, he later denied any wrongdoing, claiming he was suffering from erectile dysfunction and that no DNA evidence was found on the victim.The judge ruled that these claims did not undermine the girl’s testimony. “While there was no dispute that Ramalingam suffered from erectile dysfunction, the prosecution’s expert witness gave a cogent explanation that oral rape remained possible,” Justice Xu was quoted as saying to Straits Times.Following sentencing on July 30, Ramalingam said he would appeal and was granted bail of S$80,000. He attempted to negotiate with the judge over the conditions, asking for the removal of his electronic tag and exemption from reporting to the Police Cantonment Complex. Both requests were denied.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The incidents, condemned by authorities and community leaders, are being treated as linked. This follows a separate racist assault in Adelaide, where an Indian man was brutally attacked after being told to "f--- off, Indian."  A Hindu temple in Melbourne’s eastern suburb of Boronia was defaced with racist graffiti this week prompting widespread condemnation and police investigation.As reported by The Brisbane Times and The Sydney Morning Herald, offensive red graffiti with the words “Go home” and other racial slurs were found daubed across the Shree Swaminarayan Temple on Wadhurst Drive, as well as two nearby Asian-operated restaurants Kingsland Chinese Restaurant and Charles King Dumpling.Police said a healing centre on Mountain Highway was also defaced the same night, bringing the total number of sites attacked to four. “There is absolutely no place at all in our society for hate-based and racist behaviour,” Victoria Police said in a statement. Authorities confirmed that all four incidents are being treated as linked and that an investigation is under way.PollShould harsher penalties be implemented for hate crimes?Yes, definitelyNo, current laws are sufficient'An attack on our right to worship'Makrand Bhagwat, President of the Hindu Council of Australia’s Victoria chapter, told Australia Today the vandalism of the temple was “heartbreaking” for the community. “Our temple is meant to be a sanctuary of peace, devotion and unity,” he said. “To have it targeted in this way feels like an attack on our identity, our right to worship and freedom of religion.”Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan sent a personal message of support to temple management. “What happened this week was hateful, racist and deeply disturbing,” she wrote. “It wasn’t just vandalism – it was a deliberate act of hate, designed to intimidate, isolate, and spread fear.”Local interfaith networks, including the City of Greater Knox’s Multifaith Network, have expressed support. “We want to show that love and solidarity triumph over hate,” said community leader Vikrant Thakur.Indian man targeted in racist attackThis came after a 23-year-old Indian man, Charanpreet Singh, was brutally attacked and left unconscious on a street in Adelaide following a reported racist assault linked to a parking dispute. According to 9News, the men allegedly told Singh to "f--- off, Indian" before launching a violent, unprovoked assault.“They just said ‘f--- off, Indian’, and after that they just started punching,” Singh said. “I tried to fight back, but they beat me until I was unconscious.”He sustained serious injuries, including brain trauma and facial fractures. A 20-year-old from Enfield was arrested and charged, but others involved remain at large.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Singh and his wife were allegedly ambushed by a group of men who shouted racial slurs before inflicting serious injuries. The incident has sparked outrage and renewed calls for enhanced safety measures for international students in the area.  An Indian international student has been hospitalised with serious injuries after a violent assault in Australia's Adelaide that is being investigated as a possible racially motivated attack. The incident has sparked outrage across the Indian community and renewed calls for better safety measures for international students.Charanpreet Singh, 23, was with his wife near Kintore Avenue on Saturday evening (July 19) when they were allegedly ambushed by a group of five men. According to Australia Today, the couple had just parked their car to view the city’s light displays around 9:22pm when the attackers emerged from another vehicle.Viral video shows assaultEyewitnesses and video footage shared on social media reportedly show the men striking Singh with what appeared to be metal knuckles or sharp objects, while shouting racial abuse including: “F--- off, Indian”. The attackers then fled the scene, leaving Singh unconscious and seriously injured on the road.PollWhat should be prioritized to improve safety for international students?Awareness campaigns and community supportStronger law enforcement and quicker actionSingh, who spoke to 9News from his hospital bed, said the altercation began over a car parking dispute but escalated into a racially charged assault. “They just said, ‘F--- off, Indian,’ and after that they just started punching,” he recalled. “You can change anything in your body, but you can’t change the colours.”He sustained facial fractures and brain trauma, and was taken by emergency services to the Royal Adelaide Hospital for overnight treatment. The assault has left members of the local Indian community shaken, with many expressing solidarity with Singh online.“When things like this happen, it makes you feel like you should go back,” Singh said.Police investigation under waySouth Australia Police confirmed they were called to Kintore Avenue shortly before 9.30pm and found Singh with facial injuries. “He was taken to hospital for treatment. Investigations are continuing,” a police spokesperson told The Indian Sun. One man, a 20-year-old from Enfield, has been arrested and charged with assault causing harm. The other suspects remain at large.Authorities are reviewing CCTV footage from the area and have urged witnesses to come forward. “We ask anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers,” the police said.Premier Peter Malinauskas has condemned the incident, calling it “completely unwelcome in our state”. He added, “Any time we see any evidence of any racial attack, it is just not consistent with where the majority of our community are at.”Another attack in DublinThis follows another attack targeting an Indian individual. An Indian man in his 40s was hospitalised after being brutally attacked by a group of teenage boys in a violent, racist assault in Dublin on Saturday evening. The gang falsely accused him of inappropriate behaviour with children before beating him and pulling down his trousers. “Gardaí in Tallaght were alerted to an incident at Parkhill Road... Investigations are ongoing,” police said. Councillor Baby Pereppadan said, “He couldn’t speak much because of the shock.” Sinn Féin’s Seán Crowe added, “You are sowing hate, fear, and division.” A protest is planned for July 26 to condemn rising racist violence in Ireland.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Gita Gopinath (File photo) NEW DELHI: Gita Gopinath, the second-in-command at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), will step down at the end of August to return to her position at Harvard University, the IMF announced on Monday.The timing of Gita Gopinath’s exit has taken many within the IMF by surprise and is believed to have been prompted by her own decision, reported news agency Reuters. Having originally left Harvard to serve at the Fund, she is now set to resume her role as professor of economics at the university. Her departure opens a window for the US Treasury to propose a successor—an opportunity that comes as President Donald Trump pushes to reshape global trade dynamics and curb the country’s persistent trade deficits through sweeping tariffs on imports worldwide. Gopinath, who joined the IMF in 2019 as its first-ever female chief economist, was elevated to First Deputy Managing Director in January 2022. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva will appoint her successor “in due course,” the statement added.Gopinath had served as the first female chief economist of the Washington-based global lender for three years. Gopinath's research has been published in many top economics journals. Prior to her appointment as IMF Chief Economist, she was the John Zwaanstra Professor of International Studies and Economics in the economics department of Harvard University. Before joining the faculty of Harvard University in 2005, she was an assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.Gopinath, who considers herself a product of the Indian education system, she completed her schooling in Mysuru. She had her first brush with macro-economic challenges while doing her bachelor’s degree at Lady Shri Ram College, Delhi, with India experiencing its first major external financing and currency crisis in 1990-91. “This inspired me to pursue graduate work in economics and was the foundation for my interest in international finance,” she had told in an interview in 2010.Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.AI Masterclass for Students.

Harris courts Republicans with events on abortion rights, border security, and small business creation, while Trump takes stances that upset some conservatives. Both aim to expand their coalitions before the election. Kamala Harris trolled for 'fake accent'Kamala Harris trolled for 'fake accent' Kamala Harris trolled for 'fake accent'Kamala Harris trolled for 'fake accent' Kamala Harris trolled for 'fake accent'1234 In a surprising turn of events, US presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are blurring party lines as they vie for votes in the final stretch of a highly competitive election.Harris has been actively courting Republican voters, hosting events focused on issues such as abortion rights, border security, and small business creation, which have featured Republican officials.The Democratic National Convention even granted speaking slots to seven Republicans last month, and outside groups are spending millions to help Harris connect with disaffected opposing party members.Simultaneously, Harris has adopted a more assertive foreign policy stance, pledging to include a Republican in her Cabinet if elected and openly discussing her gun ownership."If somebody breaks in my house they're getting shot. Sorry," Harris told Oprah Winfrey, surprising the television star with her candour. Harris' strong support for US leadership on the global stage has already earned her the backing of more than 100 Republican national security and foreign policy officials who previously served under various presidents, including Dick Cheney.Trump, on the other hand, has taken positions that have irked some conservatives. He recently called for a federal cap on credit card interest rates at 10%. He expressed support for a federal law mandating insurance companies to cover in vitro fertilization (IVF), despite opposition from social conservatives who believe embryos used in the process should be protected.Barbara Comstock, a former Republican congresswoman from Virginia who co-chaired Nikki Haley's GOP presidential campaign, now supports Harris, citing her call for an expanded child care tax credit, support for a tough bipartisan immigration bill, and a foreign policy stance in contrast to Trump's admiration for leaders like Vladimir Putin.Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii and now a top Trump ally, describes Trump's policy approach as "common sense," highlighting his support for criminal justice reform and a foreign policy philosophy that seeks to avoid US involvement in global conflicts like the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Despite the candidates' embrace of policies that appeal to the other side, their priorities still largely align with their party's traditions.Trump opposes abortion rights and plans to vote to uphold a Florida law banning abortions after six weeks, while Harris supports abortion rights as protected under Roe v. Wade, backs a ban on assault weapons, and wants to extend prescription drug cost caps to all Americans.As the election draws near, both candidates are working to expand their coalitions. Trump's spokesman, Brian Hughes, argues that the GOP nominee has appeal among African Americans, Hispanics, and labour union members, citing the Teamsters Union's decision not to endorse either candidate as a significant win for Trump.Meanwhile, Harris, who has only been in the presidential race for eight weeks, is beginning to articulate specific policy plans that favour liberal policies in most cases, such as combating climate change, supporting labour unions, and pushing for voting rights legislation to combat racial discrimination.

(AP) WASHINGTON: The United States said Thursday that Russia is on the verge of unleashing a massive military attack against Ukraine, dismissing Moscow's claim to be pulling forces back, as artillery fire hit a Ukrainian kindergarten.In a dramatic, previously unscheduled speech to the United Nations in New York, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said intelligence showed Moscow could order an assault on its neighbor in the "coming days."With US and other Western governments saying they see no evidence of Russia's claim to be withdrawing, Blinken challenged the Kremlin to "announce today with no qualification, equivocation or deflection that Russia will not invade Ukraine.""Demonstrate it by sending your troops, your tanks, your planes, back to their barracks and hangers," he said.Russia denies any invasion plans but warned of "military-technical measures" if its far-reaching demands for a US and NATO pullback from eastern Europe aren't satisfied.The United States said late Thursday that Blinken and his Moscow counterpart Sergei Lavrov had agreed to meet next week -- provided there was no invasion before then.Keeping up the pressure, President Joe Biden accused Moscow of preparing a "false flag operation" as a pretext for an attack."They have not moved any of their troops out. They've moved more troops in," Biden said. "Every indication we have is that they're prepared to go into Ukraine."He added, however, that diplomacy is not dead. "There is a path. There is a way through this," he said.Biden will hold a phone meeting Friday with the leaders of Germany, Britain, France, the European Union and NATO to discuss the Ukraine crisis.Russia has massed enormous air, land and sea forces around Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin and officials say the troops are only conducting practice exercises.However, Putin has made clear that the price for removing any threat would be Ukraine agreeing never to join NATO and for the Western alliance to pull back from a swath of eastern Europe, effectively splitting the continent into Cold War-style spheres of influence.The United States said that it had received Putin's response to its offers of a diplomatic solution to the crisis, but did not give any reaction to the contents.The Russian foreign ministry indicated that there was little to discuss."In the absence of will on the American side to negotiate firm and legally binding guarantees on our security from the United States and its allies, Russia will be forced to respond, including with military-technical measures," the foreign ministry said."We insist on the withdrawal of all US armed forces in Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Baltics."Russia also expelled the number two US diplomat in Moscow, the US State Department said, condemning the "unprovoked" action.Russia took over Ukraine's Crimea region and began backing heavily armed separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Lugansk regions in 2014, sparking a war that has already cost thousands of lives.Sporadic fighting remains common in the east, and the Ukrainian army accused the pro-Russian separatists of 34 ceasefire breaches on Thursday, 28 of them using heavy weapons.The potentially most serious incident -- an example of the kind of spark that many fear could ignite far more intense fighting -- was the shelling of a kindergarten in the village of Stanytsia-Luganska. Children were inside but none were hit.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted that the attack "by pro-Russian forces is a big provocation."Russian news agencies quoted authorities in the separatist Lugansk region saying they blamed Kyiv after the situation on the frontline "escalated significantly."Western capitals say they are also concerned by the Russian parliament's request that Putin grant unilateral recognition of independence for the separatists in eastern Ukraine."If this request were accepted, it would... demonstrate a Russian decision to choose a path of confrontation over dialogue," British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said.Putin earlier this week claimed with no evidence that Ukraine is committing "genocide" in the eastern region.Moscow has made several announcements of troop withdrawals this week and on Thursday said that tank units had begun returning to their bases from near Ukraine.The United States, NATO and Ukraine all said they had seen no evidence of a pullback, with Washington saying Russia had in fact moved 7,000 more troops near the border.According to US officials, there are now about 150,000 Russian troops arrayed in offensive groupings on the southern, eastern and northern borders of Ukraine.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  5 signs of a master manipulator, as per psychology5 traditional Indian hair oils for hair growthBigg Boss Kannada 11: Full and final list of contestantsFrom Golla getting his first seat on the flight to missing the last cable car in Interlaken; A look at Bharti Singh and Haarsh Limbachiyaa's first Europe Trip with their little munchkin5 sneakers you should stay away from; a Nike shoe is also on the list!5 body language tips to appear more confidentTop 5 Indian states with the highest per capita incomeWeekly Horoscope: September 30th to October 6th, 20247 vegetables that reduce belly fat quickly5 psychology tricks to make people magically like you123Hot PicksTirupati Laddu Case Hearing LiveDaylight Savings 2024Erika Carr UtahPakistan Job CutsNepal FloodsAir Canada FinedStock Market TodayTOP TRENDINGRafale Marine Flight JetsHarvard Application ProcessWho is Parita ParekhPaul HeymanDelhi Dwarka ExpresswayWWE Royal RumbleBad Blood 2024Carlos AlcarazMohammed SirajBrain Exercises to Boost MemoryTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website9 Timeless Skills That Will Always Be in Demand7 Effective Ways for Professionals to Enhance Productivity and Cultivate Inner Peace12 Effective Ways to Improve Handwriting for ExamsStock market crash today: BSE Sensex plunges over 1,200 points; Nifty50 ends below 25,850 - top reasons markets have tankedTNA Star Eric Young shared his thoughts on the docuseries about WWE’s former chairmanWho is Parita Parekh, youngest Indian entrepreneur and a Stanford alumnaSeventeen KIIT Athletics Who Participated in Paris Olympics & Paralympics Felicitated By Varsity'Team India ka Ghajini kaun hai?' - Rohit Sharma answers10 Common Habits That Could Be Hindering Your SuccessJ&K police head constable Bashir Ahmed killed after gunning down terrorist in Kathua encounterAs Biden calls for ceasefire, Israel tells US it will launch ground offensive in Lebanon soonHigh stakes in J&K polls phase 3: 415 candidates vie for 40 constituenciesKashmir’s ‘X factor’: Is he only a vote cutter or is he the real deal?'Fanatic theocrats leading you to abyss': Netanyahu warns IraniansMuda case: K'taka CM's wife offers to surrender 14 plotsSA20 Auction: Players, squads, date - everything you need to knowExplained: Silicon-carbon batteries have arrived in phones.

And scientists say the exceptionally hot year is part of a long-term warming trend that shows hints of accelerating. Two U.S. science agencies - NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - and a private measuring group released their calculations for last year's global temperature on Thursday, and all said it wasn't far behind ultra-hot 2016 and 2020. Six different calculations found 2021 was between the fifth and seventh hottest year since the late 1800s. NASA said 2021 tied with 2018 for sixth warmest, while NOAA puts last year in sixth place by itself, ahead of 2018. Scientists say a La Nina - natural cooling of parts of the central Pacific that changes weather patterns globally and brings chilly deep ocean water to the surface - dampened global temperatures just as its flip side, El Nino, boosted them in 2016.  Still, they said 2021 was the hottest La Nina year on record and that the year did not represent a cooling off of human-caused climate change but provided more of the same heat. "So it's not quite as headline-dominating as being the warmest on record, but give it another few years and we'll see another one of those" records, said climate scientist Zeke Hausfather of the Berkeley Earth monitoring group that also ranked 2021 the sixth hottest. "It's the long-term trend, and it's an indomitable march upward." Gavin Schmidt, the climate scientist who heads NASA's temperature team, said "the long-term trend is very, very clear. And it's because of us. And it's not going to go away until we stop increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere." The last eight years have been the eight hottest on record, NASA and NOAA data agree. Global temperatures, averaged over a 10-year period to take out natural variability, are nearly 2 degrees (1.1 degrees Celsius) warmer than 140 years ago, their data shows.  The other 2021 measurements came from the Japanese Meteorological Agency and satellite measurements by Copernicus Climate Change Service i n Europe and the University of Alabama in Huntsville. There was such a distinctive jump in temperatures about eight to 10 years ago that scientists have started looking at whether the rise in temperatures is speeding up. Both Schmidt and Hausfather said early signs point to that but it's hard to know for sure. "I think you can see the acceleration, but whether it's statistically robust is not quite clear," Schmidt said in an interview. "If you just look at the last the last 10 years, how many of them are way above the trend line from the previous 10 years? Almost all of them." The global average temperature last year was 58.5 degrees (14.7 Celsius), according to NOAA. In 1988, NASA's then-chief climate scientist James Hansen grabbed headlines when he testified to Congress about global warming in a year that was the hottest on record at the time. Now, the 57.7 degrees (14.3 Celsius) of 1988 ranks as the 28th hottest year on record.  Last year, 1.8 billion people in 25 Asian, African and Middle Eastern nations had their hottest years on record, including China, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Iran, Myanmar and South Korea, according to Berkeley Earth. The deep ocean, where most heat is stored in the seas, also set a record for warmth in 2021, according to a separate new study. "Ocean warming, aside from causing coral bleaching and threatening sea life and fish populations we rely upon for roughly 25% of our protein intake globally, is destabilizing Antarctic ice shelves and threatens massive ... sea level rise if we don't act," said study co-author Michael Mann, a Pennsylvania State University climate scientist. The last time Earth had a cooler than normal year by NOAA or NASA calculations was 1976. That means 69% of the people on the planet - more than 5 billion people under age 45 - have never experienced such a year, based on United Nations data. North Carolina state climatologist Kathie Dello, 39, who wasn't part of the new reports but said they make sense, said, "I've only lived in a warming world and I wish that the younger generations did not have to say the same. It didn't have to be this way."End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  Bigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial show5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the world​Bigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8​Bigg Boss 18: From Shehzada Dhami making serious allegations against Rajan Shahi to Alice Kaushik opening up about her parents’ demise: Major highlights from the show5 types of people one should completely avoid for peace in life, as per psychology10 most powerful countries in the world in 20245 minimalist habits to stop wasting your time​10 most educated countries of the world​From Aamir Khan's warm surprise with son Junaid to a musical tribute; A look at Amitabh Bachchan's 82nd Birthday celebration on the sets of Kaun Banega Crorepati 167 vegetables that reduce belly fat quicklyHow tall are Trump family membersTGIKS 2: From impersonating legendary cricketer MS Dhoni to revealing secrets from the World Cup: Top moments featuring Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and others123Hot PicksAssembly Election Result 2024 DateIsrael Hezbollah War Live2024 Nobel Prize in MedicineHaryana Assembly Constituencies 2024AIIMS Doctors Candle MarchPakistan Airport ExplosionChennai Air Show ChaosTOP TRENDINGElection Result Date and TimeKayla NicoleBasit AliWorld Richest FamilyThe San Francisco 49ersIsrael MossadRRB JE Exam DatePresident MuizzuJimmy UsosSadhguru QuotesTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteElection Results 2024 Live: Stage set in J&K, Haryana for first major BJP vs Congress showdown since Lok Sabha pollsTravis Kelce's Ex Kayla Nicole Delivers a Powerful 'Mental Health' Message While Facing Backlash from Taylor Swift Fans"Travis Kelce's career is over": Travis Kelce’s time in Kansas City may be numbered as the Chiefs decided to re-sign one of their familiar faces9 Powerful Quotes to Motivate Students Towards Success Through Hard WorkTop 10 Largest Economies In The World 2025: India To Become 4th Largest Economy Soon!

Israel on Thursday approved a fourth dose of vaccine for people with weakened immune systems, and Britain’s National Health Service said its hospitals would erect field wards to help deal with the surge in coronavirus cases.Several US states hit their all-time case records for coronavirus cases this week, disrupting the lives of millions of Americans. New York Mayor-elect Eric Adams vowed to keep the city’s vaccine mandate for private-sector employees in place, and the CDC issued a blunt warning to potential travelers: “Avoid cruise travel regardless of vaccination status.”Health officials are trying to encourage more Americans to get a booster shot — just over one-third of fully vaccinated adults have received one — and warn that the unvaccinated face the greatest risk of severe illness and death from omicron.“Our CDC guidance has been very clear that people should get their boost when they are eligible,” Dr. Rochelle PWalensky, the CDC director, told reporters this week. “That is both for — because of waning immunity and because we need more protection against Omicron.”Walensky said Wednesday that even as daily case counts had climbed by roughly 60% in the past week, hospitalizations and deaths were still relatively low, a suggestion that omicron might be less lethal. She and Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, cited international research hinting at the same conclusion.Studies have shown that while two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine have provided strong protection as the delta variant swarmed the country, omicron can evade the defenses of fully vaccinated people, heightening fears about the risks for young people.More than 70% of people 12 and older in the United States are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. Around one-quarter of children between 5 and 11 have received at least one dose. Children under 5 are still not eligible for a vaccine.The latest surge has caused a concerning rise in hospitalizations among children. But early data suggests that omicron appears to be causing milder illness for children, similar to findings for adults. And hospital officials and physicians have said that nearly all children hospitalized with Covid-19 were unvaccinated or partially vaccinated.Children can better withstand coronavirus infections but in rare instances can still become very sick and even die. At least 1.8 million adolescents between 12 and 15 years old have tested positive for the virus, according to the CDC.A series of studies published Thursday by the agency underscored how important vaccination can be for children and adolescents. In one study spanning July through early December that examined hundreds of adolescents in Arizona, researchers said two doses of the vaccine reduced the risk of infection by 92%.Two other CDC studies showed that there were few serious side effects reported among 5- to 11-year-olds who had received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and that pediatric hospitalizations occurred mostly among children who had not been fully vaccinated.A recent South African study showed that the effectiveness of Pfizer’s vaccine against severe illness and hospitalization was about 70% after two doses, against omicron in particular.Of the three federally authorized coronavirus shots, Pfizer-BioNTech's is the only vaccine approved for use in people under 18.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory committee is planning to meet by the middle of next week to weigh in on whether to recommend the changes in the FDA’s booster policy. If the committee agrees with the FDA’s authorizations, Walensky is expected to promptly endorse the revisions.Dr. Kathryn M. Edwards, a vaccine expert and professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said the FDA’s expected decision was justified.“We’re having a lot of suggestions and a lot of experience with omicron that it’s infecting people that have been boosted. But fortunately, we’re not seeing a lot of severe disease,” she said. “So I think if you look at the immune responses, at least in adults, you’ll see that this booster dose does enhance your neutralization capacity against omicron.”Other vaccine experts said the administration’s continued attention to offering boosters to younger, healthier people was misguided.Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, said research on vaccine effectiveness, including against omicron, had revealed that two doses offer substantial and durable protection against severe disease, including in adolescents — the purpose of vaccination, he said.A booster dose could increase a person's protection for several months, he said, but delivering extra shots to young Americans was “focusing on the people who are already protected.”The Biden administration, he added, should instead direct more attention to reaching the unvaccinated, a point he said was backed up by the overwhelming majority of hospitalized children he had seen in Philadelphia being unvaccinated.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the worldBigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial show​Bigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8​10 most powerful countries in the world in 20247 vegetables that reduce belly fat quickly​10 most educated countries of the world​How tall are Trump family membersTGIKS 2: From impersonating legendary cricketer MS Dhoni to revealing secrets from the World Cup: Top moments featuring Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and othersWhere the zodiac signs would prefer to liveFrom Bharti Singh- Elvish Yadav getting summoned in Rs 500 crore fraud case to Khushi Mali replacing Palak Sindhwani in Taarak Mehta: Top TV newsSunny Deol's 'Gadar', Shah Rukh Khan's 'Devdas', Rishi Kapoor's 'Chandni': Movies allegedly rejected by GovindaOptical illusion psychology test: The first thing you see reveals the hidden flaw affecting your relationships123Hot PicksIsrael Hezbollah War LiveBhopal Factory Drug SeizeGang Attack in HaitiAIIMS Doctors Candle MarchPakistan Airport ExplosionChennai Air Show ChaosHurricane Milton EvacuationTOP TRENDINGKarachi Airport BlastKayla NicoleWorld Richest FamilyThe San Francisco 49ersIsrael MossadPrince WilliamPresident MuizzuChinese Spy BallonsRishabh PantSadhguru QuotesTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website"Travis Kelce's career is over": Travis Kelce’s time in Kansas City may be numbered as the Chiefs decided to re-sign one of their familiar facesTravis Kelce's Ex Kayla Nicole Delivers a Powerful 'Mental Health' Message While Facing Backlash from Taylor Swift Fans'Diddy List': Names of celebrities connected to Sean Combs viral3 dead in Chennai after Indian Air Force air showFour spectators dead after Chennai air showPresident Muizzu in India: 'Will never hurt India's security interests, Maldives first but will prioritise ties with India'1 dead, 10 injured in massive explosion near Karachi airportIAF quietly shooting down 'Chinese spy balloons' at high altitudes'Wouldn't have given birth': Gaza mother struggles to provide for newborns amid conflictRishabh Pant's Masterclass: How India conquered the fortress GabbaMiracle at 17,000 ft: How two US & UK climbers were rescued from HimalayasRahul's heartfelt cooking session with Dalit man, his family;

Lance Lowry (Agency photo) NEW YORK: At a Georgia state House of Representatives hearing on prison conditions in September, a corrections officer called in to testify, interrupting his shift to tell lawmakers how dire conditions had become. On a "good day," he told lawmakers, he had maybe six or seven officers to supervise roughly 1,200 people. He said he had recently been assigned to look after 400 prisoners by himself.There weren't enough nurses to provide medical care. "All the officers ... absolutely despise working there," said the officer, who didn't give his name for fear of retaliation. In Texas, Lance Lowry quit after 20 years as a corrections officer to become a long-haul trucker because he couldn't bear the job any longer. Watching friends and coworkers die from COVID-19, along with dwindling support from his superiors, wore on him. "I would have liked to stay till I was 50," said Lowry, 48. "But the pandemic changed that." Staff shortages have long been a challenge for prison agencies, given the low pay and grueling nature of the work. But the coronavirus pandemic - and its impact on the labor market - has pushed many corrections systems into crisis. Officers are retiring and quitting in droves, while officials struggle to recruit new employees. And some prisons whose populations dropped during the pandemic have seen their numbers rise again, exacerbating the problem. There is no one thing pushing prison employees out in high numbers now. Some are leaving for new opportunities as more places are hiring. University of Michigan economist Betsey Stevenson pointed to the increased risk of COVID-19 for people working in prisons. "When jobs become riskier, it becomes harder to attract workers," she wrote in an email. "By failing to protect prisoners from COVID, the criminal justice system not only created an unfair risk of severe illness and death for the incarcerated, but the increased COVID risk to employees has undoubtedly contributed to staffing shortages." Unions representing prison officers in states including Massachusetts and California and at the federal level also claim vaccine mandates will drive out unvaccinated employees and exacerbate understaffing, though it's unclear how big of an impact those rules will have. "There are dozens of reasons to leave and very few to stay," said Brian Dawe, national director of One Voice United, a nonprofit supporting corrections officers. "Understaffing, poor pay, poor benefits, horrendous working conditions. Officers and their families in many jurisdictions have had enough." Employers from construction companies to restaurants are having difficulty hiring and keeping people. Nearly 3% of American workers, 4.3 million, quit their jobs in August, according to new data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the stakes are higher in prisons, where having fewer guards means significantly more dangerous conditions for incarcerated people. And for the officers left behind, worsening shortages have made an already difficult job unbearable, many say. In Georgia, some prisons report up to 70% vacancy rates. In Nebraska, overtime hours have quadrupled since 2010, as fewer officers are forced to work longer hours. Florida has temporarily closed three prisons out of more than 140 because of understaffing, and vacancy rates have nearly doubled there in the last year. And at federal prisons across the country, guards are picketing in front of their facilities over understaffing, while everyone from prison teachers to dentists is pulled in to cover security shifts. In recent weeks, reporters from The Marshall Project and The Associated Press have spoken with workers, officials, attorneys and people incarcerated in more than a dozen prison systems to understand the consequences of the staffing shortfalls. The federal Bureau of Prisons says about 93% of its front-line guard positions are filled, with little more than 1,000 vacancies, though workers in many prisons say they're feeling the pinch as others are conscripted to fill in for missing officers. Asked last week in a U.S. Senate hearing about federal prison staffing, Attorney General Merrick Garland said, "I agree this is a serious problem at the Bureau of Prisons." Garland told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco was working with the bureau to address staffing issues. Inside prisons, growing shortages mean a rise in lockdowns. Restrictions that might have begun as a way to stop the spread of COVID-19 have continued because there aren't enough guards to supervise activities. Some incarcerated people say they can't take classes, participate in group therapy sessions or even work out in the recreation yard or take a shower. That can force those in general population into de facto solitary confinement, and those already in segregation into near-total lockdown. "If we get rec once a week, that's a good week," said Anthony Haynes, who is on Texas' death row in a unit that is barely half-staffed. "We don't always get showers." A spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice did not respond to Haynes' claims but acknowledged that staffing is a challenge in Texas' prisons. "Before COVID-19, staffing was frequently impacted by economic surges and competing employment opportunities," said spokesman Robert Hurst in an email. "The pandemic has exacerbated these issues. We also recognize that the job of the correctional officer is one of the most difficult in all of state government." He added that Texas has closed six of its more than 100 facilities in the last year due to staffing problems. Kansas has cut job training and reduced supervision for people after they're released. Two-thirds of the men in Nebraska's prisons can't see visitors on the weekends - when most families are free to travel - because of understaffing. Dr. Homer Venters, a former chief medical officer for the jail system in New York City, inspects conditions in prisons around the country for court cases. Understaffing will lead to an increase in preventable prison deaths, he said, as the quality of care reaches new lows. "Things are much worse behind bars now than they have been for a long time," Venters said. "There are so many staff that have left. That means that basic clinical services, like getting to scheduled appointments, just isn't happening the way it was even five years ago."End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  Bigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial showSchengen visa denials: 5 countries with the highest rejection ratesSanjay Dutt-Manyata to Hardik Pandya-Natasa Stankovic: Bollywood couples who renewed their wedding vows5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the world8 animals that help Earth heal and how5 psychology tips to be more mature in life and relationships10 most powerful countries in the world in 2024From getting kicked out from Shark Tank India 4 to marrying a Mexico-based model, buying India’s first : Times when Deepinder Goyal made headlines​Bigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8​123Hot PicksUS Election Timeline 2024World's Fastest JetsDelhi Drugs in NamkeenHarris vs Trump Latest PollsUP Scholarships Non-Creamy LayerMahadev Betting AppStock market todayTOP TRENDINGRic FlairNavi Mumbai AirportPrince HarryNFL Week SeasonActor NithinIPL FranchisesAyudha Puja DateRatan TataKali Crown BangladeshDiddy ListTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website“When you know, you know”: Russell Wilson’s Wife Ciara Revealed That She Knew Wilson Was The One After Their First DateTollywood actor Nithin arrested for snatching gold chain in HyderabadRatan Tata’s successor: Noel Tata appointed chairman of Tata TrustsDiwali 2024 Date: When is Deepawali?

(Agency photo) NEW YORK: US President Thomas Jefferson's statue, a presence for more than a century in the New York City Council chamber, is coming down following a public commission reassessment of the legacy of the founding father who was also a slaveholder. The New York City Public Design Commission voted unanimously on Monday to dismantle the 7-foot (2.13-meter) bronze likeness of Jefferson, which has watched over proceedings in the most populous U.S.city since 1915. The commission agreed to lend the 187-year-old statue long-term to the New-York Historical Society. It is a plaster model of a statue still on display in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. "Jefferson embodied some of the most shameful parts of our country's long and nuanced history," Councilperson Adrienne Adams, co-chair of the council's Black, Latino and Asian Caucus, told the commission. "It is time for the city to turn the page and move forward." Similar monuments have become a target of anti-racism protests in recent years. Statues of Civil War Confederate leaders have also been dismantled.Jefferson's place in U.S. history is complex. Having written that "all men are created equal" as the primary author of the Declaration of Independence, he also enslaved more than 600 people and fathered at least six children with Sally Hemings, a woman he enslaved. Not everyone supported the removal of the statue. Sean Wilentz, a American history professor at Princeton University, wrote in a letter read to the commission: "The statue specifically honors Jefferson for his greatest contribution to America, indeed, to humankind."

(Getty Images)  WASHINGTON: Pakistan and its intelligence service have played a key role in fostering the Taliban and allowing it to eventually take over Afghanistan, a top Republican lawmaker has alleged, stating that it is disgusting to watch Islamabad celebrate the group's victory that will bring "untold brutality" to Afghans.Congressman Steve Chabot, Co-Chair of the India Caucus, said in his address to the virtual gala of Hindu Political Action Committee on Sunday that he applauds the Indian government for welcoming the Afghan religious minorities who have a good reason to fear persecution at the hands of the Taliban and their evil rule.“In contrast, we all know that Pakistan and particularly its intelligence services played a key role fostering the Taliban and allowing them to eventually take over. It's just disgusting to watch Pakistani officials celebrate the victory of this group that will bring untold brutality to the Afghan people,” Chabot said.“Pakistan's own persecution of religious minorities, however, gets a lot less attention here in America than it deserves. We would do well to educate our fellow citizens about these abuses. Persecution is particularly manifests in the heinous practice of the kidnapping, force conversion to Islam and forced marriage of underage Hindu girls to older Muslim men,” he said.Such allegations are not mere hearsay, he noted.Major news organisations and human rights groups have documented the practice with so many heartbreaking stories of girls in their early teens taken from their families, and traffic into forced marriages. These abuses are often just ignored, said the Congressman.In his address, Chabot said that with roughly 6 million Hindus in America, Hindus are unquestionably an integral part of society throughout the United States.“Through strong work ethic and high educational attainment, Hindus exemplify the American dream. These virtues also allow Hindus to take on key roles in communities across the country, and also give back to those communities in so many ways,” he said.That is why the reports of a rise in discrimination against Hindu Americans around the country are so concerning, he rued, adding that there is no place in America for such discrimination.“We must all seek ways to bring it to an end,” Chabot added.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  Bigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial show5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the world​Bigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8​Bigg Boss 18: From Shehzada Dhami making serious allegations against Rajan Shahi to Alice Kaushik opening up about her parents’ demise: Major highlights from the show5 types of people one should completely avoid for peace in life, as per psychology10 most powerful countries in the world in 20245 minimalist habits to stop wasting your time​10 most educated countries of the world​From Aamir Khan's warm surprise with son Junaid to a musical tribute; A look at Amitabh Bachchan's 82nd Birthday celebration on the sets of Kaun Banega Crorepati 167 vegetables that reduce belly fat quicklyHow tall are Trump family membersTGIKS 2: From impersonating legendary cricketer MS Dhoni to revealing secrets from the World Cup: Top moments featuring Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and others123Hot PicksAssembly Election Result 2024 DateIsrael Hezbollah War Live2024 Nobel Prize in MedicineHaryana Assembly Constituencies 2024AIIMS Doctors Candle MarchPakistan Airport ExplosionChennai Air Show ChaosTOP TRENDINGElection Result Date and TimeKayla NicoleBasit AliWorld Richest FamilyThe San Francisco 49ersIsrael MossadRRB JE Exam DatePresident MuizzuJimmy UsosSadhguru QuotesTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteElection Results 2024 Live: Stage set in J&K, Haryana for first major BJP vs Congress showdown since Lok Sabha pollsTravis Kelce's Ex Kayla Nicole Delivers a Powerful 'Mental Health' Message While Facing Backlash from Taylor Swift Fans"Travis Kelce's career is over": Travis Kelce’s time in Kansas City may be numbered as the Chiefs decided to re-sign one of their familiar faces9 Powerful Quotes to Motivate Students Towards Success Through Hard WorkTop 10 Largest Economies In The World 2025: India To Become 4th Largest Economy Soon!

(Reuters Photo) WASHINGTON: Democrats face a test of unity in the US House of Representatives on Monday as they begin work on two ambitious spending plans that would devote trillions of dollars to transportation infrastructure and social programs.While centrist Democrats are eager to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that has already won approval in the Senate, liberals say they must prioritize a $3.5 trillion budget blueprint that would expand spending on child care and education.Both measures are priorities for Democratic President Joe Biden.The first test will come on Monday evening when the House is due to vote on a package that would advance both spending bills, as well as a separate voting rights proposal.That would clear the way for a final vote on the budget plan and the voting rights bill on Tuesday, but would not set a timeline for passage of the infrastructure bill.Nine moderates who are pushing the House to first pass the infrastructure bill have threatened to vote against the package. That could potentially scuttle it in the House, where Democrats hold a 220-212 majority."There is a standoff with some of our colleagues who have decided to hold the infrastructure bill hostage for months, or kill it altogether if they don’t get what they want in the next bill," they wrote in the Washington Post on Monday.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has sided with liberals who worry they might lose leverage on the social spending effort if they first pass the infrastructure bill. She wants the House to complete work on both bills by Oct. 1."Any delay to passing the budget resolution threatens the timetable for delivering the historic progress and the transformative vision that Democrats share," Pelosi wrote fellow Democrats on Saturday.No Republicans are expected to support the budget resolution plan, which sets the broad outline for spending on education, childcare, healthcare and climate measures favoured by Biden and pays for them with tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations.Crucially, the budget resolution plan would allow Democrats to pass those spending measures on a simple majority vote in the Senate, rather than the 60 votes required for most legislation in that chamber.The Senate is split 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats. Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris has the power, however, to cast the tie-breaking vote.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  Bigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial show​Bigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8​5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the worldFrom 'Bigg Boss' star to fitness icon: Shehnaaz Gill's inspiring weight loss journey10 most powerful countries in the world in 2024Universe Guidance For Each Zodiac SignTop 10 Largest Economies In The World 2025: India To Become 4th Largest Economy Soon!

(Reuters Photo)  WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden is brushing off criticism of his administration's chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal because he and his aides believe the political fallout at home will be limited, according to White House allies and administration officials.Biden and his top aides argue they are managing an evacuation mission https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/afghanistan-edge-after-anti-taliban-protest-east-kabul-calm-airlift-goes-2021-08-19 as well as could be expected given the faster-than-anticipated takeover of the country by the Taliban, and are seeking to draw attention back to the choice to get U.S.troops out of the country.The strategy is based on internal and public polling that shows the Afghanistan withdrawal had been by far the most popular decision Biden has made, even though the issue was not central for most voters."The public opinion is pretty damn clear that Americans wanted out of the ongoing war and don't want to get back in. It's true today and it's going to be true in six months," said one Biden ally. "It isn't about not caring or being empathetic about what's going on over there but worrying about what's happening in America."Biden has faced criticism even from some fellow Democrats for his handling of the crisis.But White House officials believe Americans' horror over graphic images https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/small-afghan-girl-is-lifted-crowd-capturing-desperation-flee-kabul-2021-08-19 of the chaos in Kabul and pleas from Afghans who fear they will be killed by the Taliban will morph into support for the president's decision to pull troops from the country by Aug. 31 after a 20-year war.They expect the Afghanistan story to recede from the headlines, replaced by the resurgence in COVID-19 cases, the economic recovery and other issues, people familiar with the matter said.A White House spokesperson declined to comment.Biden aides honed talking points weeks ago to be used even in the worst-case scenarios of a withdrawal, some of which have come to pass, including emphasizing that leaving Afghanistan was the right decision."The idea that somehow, there's a way to have gotten out without chaos ensuing, I don't know how that happens," Biden told ABC News on Wednesday. "There is no good time to leave Afghanistan. Fifteen years ago would've been a problem, 15 years from now. The basic choice is am I going to send your sons and your daughters to war in Afghanistan in perpetuity?"In recent days, Biden has also assailed the Afghan military for refusing to fight, denounced the now-ousted Afghan government and declared he inherited a bad withdrawal agreement from his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump.The strategy has obvious risks, political experts say. "The concern is that it's going to undercut his credibility as commander in chief," said Jim Manley, once a top aide to former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. "If the Taliban revert to what they've done in the past, and I assume that's going to be the case, it's going to be a lot of bad images coming out of that country."INADEQUATE RESPONSEThe Afghanistan messaging is increasingly at odds with an emerging consensus within the administration that the White House, Defense and State departments as well as the U.S. intelligence community's planning for the current situation was inadequate and needs to be fully reviewed once the mission of evacuating key people from Afghanistan is complete and the 5,200 U.S. troops now in Kabul are gone."We're at the Pentagon and even we know it could have been better," said one official. "A lot better." Members of the U.S. Congress also plan to investigate what went wrong.Public opinion, at least for now, is mixed. A majority of both Republican and Democratic voters say https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-approval-drops-lowest-level-this-year-after-taliban-takeover-2021-08-17 the swift capitulation of the Afghan government "is evidence why the U.S. should get out of the conflict."Reuters/Ipsos polling this week found that 31% of American adults agreed that the United States should continue its military operations in Afghanistan, up from the 25% who felt the same way in a 2012 poll.Yet Ipsos polling https://tmsnrt.rs/3k4cwxs conducted on Monday also showed fewer than half of Americans liked the way Biden had steered the U.S. military and diplomatic effort in Afghanistan this year. They currently rate his performance worse than the other three presidents who presided over the United States' longest war, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Trump.Biden's overall approval sank to 46% of American adults in Reuters/Ipsos polling, the lowest recorded in weekly polls since he took office in January.Republicans, including Trump, have started weaponizing the withdrawal as an issue to undermine faith in Biden as commander in chief.Most Democrats are likely to embrace public support of the withdrawal decision, and the issue should die down before the November 2022 congressional elections, said one adviser working on Democratic congressional campaigns.She added, however: "The Biden administration will likely have to defend every negative headline that comes out of Afghanistan during his tenure, so that is a real unknown."End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  From being 3 months pregnant while sitting on the hotseat to her son calling Amitabh Bachchan 'dadu'; Shruthy Daga opens up about her 'arranged marriage', KBC14 Journey and more9 morning habits that can bring down cholesterol levels within a monthLaughter Chefs: From Bharti Singh- Krushna Abhishek getting emotional to Nia Sharma getting teary eyed on missing Sudesh Lehri: Top moments from the recent episodeAstro-Numerology October 2024: Sanjay B Jumaani's Predictions for Each Number (1-9)5 traditional Indian hair oils for hair growth5 herbal drinks that help in reducing blood sugar levelsHappy Gandhi Jayanti 2024: Images, Wishes, Messages, Quotes, Pictures and Greeting CardsFrom Prince Narula - Yuvika Chaudhary to Keith Sequeira - Rochelle Maria Rao; Couples who found love in the Bigg Boss houseOptical illusion psychology test: What you see first reveals what you truly want in a relationship5 body language tips to appear more confidentWinter is coming: 5 places in India for a winter vacation in October5 signs of a master manipulator, as per psychology123Hot PicksIsrael Hezbollah War LiveOldest Miss UniverseErika Carr UtahPakistan Job CutsJ&K Phase 3 Elections LiveAir Canada FinedStock Market TodayTOP TRENDINGTimeless SkillHelicopter Crashes PuneIran Israel ConflictIND vs PAK T20 World CupBrittany MahomesMorne MorkelGaurav TanejaMichael VaughanRahul GandhiBrain Exercises to Boost MemoryTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website"Tears of Joy and Sorrow: Brittany Mahomes’ Heartfelt Reflection Amid Family Health Struggles"'Diddy List': Names of celebrities connected to Sean Combs viralHow tall is JD Vance?

The Daniel K Inouye Solar Telescope, at the summit of Haleakalā volcano on Maui, was supposed to open last fall. But Thomas Rimmele told Hawaii Public Radio on Wednesday that the Covid-19 travel restrictions set back construction on its critical systems.He hopes the current schedule won't be affected by newly surging coronavirus cases and any additional restrictions. Rimmele was expecting to return to Maui as early as this week. "November 15 is what we're shooting for. We just had a big review, the final construction review that was conducted by the National Science Foundation," Rimmele said. "(The scientists) are getting really anxious to get their observations and data done." The telescope has received about 100 proposals from researchers for an initial observing window of two-and-a-half months. Picking, which scientists get to go first, depends heavily on atmospheric conditions and what objects are visible on a given day.  He said one quarter or even a fifth of the proposals may be approved for the first cycle. "We are highly oversubscribed and people will have to submit proposals again for the next cycle," he said. "That's just how it works."The National Solar Observatory said the Inouye telescope will be able to reveal features three times smaller than anything scientists are able to see on the Sun currently. The Hawaii Supreme Court in 2016 affirmed a permit for the solar telescope's construction. The next year, more than 100 protesters tried to block a construction convoy heading to the telescope site, citing the sacredness of Haleakala's summit. Maui police had then arrested six people.

During the World Championship of Legends, India Champions refused to play Pakistan Champions. Harbhajan Singh advocates for the current team to follow suit in the Asia Cup, emphasizing that national interests outweigh sports, especially considering the sacrifices made by soldiers. Image credit: AFP NEW DELHI: Following the Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor, there has been a growing demand for India to boycott Pakistan across all fronts, including cricket. The sentiment gained momentum during the World Championship of Legends (WCL), when the India Champions refused to face the Pakistan Champions in both the group stage and the semifinals. The Indian squad, comprising stalwarts like Shikhar Dhawan, Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan Singh, Irfan Pathan, Suresh Raina, and Yusuf Pathan, stood firm in their decision.Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh, who has taken over 700 international wickets, made his stance clear, stating that “cricket is too small a thing in front of the nation.” India’s refusal to play Pakistan came in response to the gruesome Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed numerous innocent lives.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Harbhajan believes the current Indian team, led by Suryakumar Yadav, should take a similar stand in the upcoming Asia Cup and decline to face their arch-rivals."Jo dono deshon mein tensions hain, takraar hain, jab tak wo theek nahi hoti, hume cricket nahi khelni chahiye. This is my opinion. Ye bahut chhoti aur maamuli baat hai. Cricket bahut chhoti cheez hai desh ke aage [As long as the tensions and disputes between the two countries remain unresolved, we should not play cricket. This is my opinion. Cricket is a very small thing compared to the nation]," Harbhajan told TimesofIndia.com in an interview."For me, humare desh ka wo jawan jo sarhad par khada hua hai, unki families jo kai baar unko nahi dekh paati hain, unki shahadat ho jaati hai, wo ghar wapas nahi laut paate hain — unki itni badi sacrifice hoti hai hum sabke liye. Toh ye to bahut chhoti si baat hai (on boycotting Pakistan matches) ki hum ek cricket match na chhod sakein? Ye bahut chhoti si baat hai [For me, the soldier who stands on the border, whose family often doesn’t get to see him, who sometimes sacrifices his life and never returns home — their sacrifice is so immense for all of us. Compared to that, (on boycotting Pakistan matches) this is a very small thing — that we can’t even skip playing one cricket match. It’s a very small matter]," Harbhajan said."Humari government ka bhi ek naara hai ki 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte.' Ye baat bilkul theek hai. Ye to ho nahi sakta ki sarhad par ladai ho, tanaav ho aur hum cricket khelne chale jaayein. Jab tak ye badi cheezein settle nahi hoti hain, cricket bahut chhoti si cheez hai. Nation always comes first [Our government also has a slogan: ‘Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte.’ This is absolutely correct. It cannot be that there’s fighting on the border, tensions between the two nations, and we go to play cricket. Until these big issues are resolved, cricket is a very small matter. The nation always comes first]," Harbhajan said."Jo bhi hamara wajood hai wo iss desh ki wajah se hai, aur chahe wo khiladi ho, abhineta ho ya koi bhi ho, desh se bada koi nahi hota hai. Desh jo hai wo sabse aage hai, aur desh ke prati jo hamare farz bante hain, wo hume nibhane chahiye. Cricket match na khelna bahut maamuli si cheez hai desh ke saamne [Whatever our identity is, it’s because of this country. Whether you are a player, an actor, or anyone else — no one is bigger than the nation. The country comes first, and the duties we owe to it must be fulfilled. Not playing a cricket match is nothing compared to the importance of the nation]," the former spinner said."Humare sarhad pe bhai khade hue hain, jo hume protect kar rahe hain, humare desh ko protect kar rahe hain — unke hausle dekho, wo kitna bada dil leke waha pe khade hue hain. Aur unke parivaar par kya beetati hai jab wo ghar wapas nahi aate. Aur hum cricket khelne chale jaate hain [At the border, our brothers are standing, protecting us and our country. Look at their courage, the big hearts with which they serve. Think about what their families go through when they don’t return home. And here we are, playing cricket]," he said."Hum unko itni importance kyun dete hain? Are they that important? Are they that important ki har news channel unko chalaye? When you have boycotted them, when you don't want to talk to them, then why show them here? This is the duty of the media — to stop this. They shouldn't be adding fuel to the fire. As I said, cricketers shouldn't be shaking hands with the Pakistan players, but the media shouldn't be showing them and their reactions on television either. They are sitting in their country and can say whatever they want, but we shouldn’t be highlighting them. Aisa bhi koi bayaan nahi hai jiska koi sir aur pair ho, aur agar koi ulta bayaan deta hai to usko phir jawaab denge," he said.India are defending champions. They defeated Sri Lanka by 10 wickets in the last edition of Asia Cup to clinch their eighth title — the most by any country in the competition.The Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee is likely to select the squad for the Asia Cup soon.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Virat Kohli of India (Photo by Francois Nel/Getty Images) Former Indian cricketer S Sreesanth has shared his views on Virat Kohli's aggressive playing style and reflected on his own career experiences during a conversation with sports commentator Padamjeet Sehrawat on his YouTube channel. Sreesanth, who was part of India's 2011 World Cup-winning team alongside Kohli, emphasized that Kohli's aggressive demeanor is essential to his success as a player.Sreesanth expressed his perspective on Kohli's on-field behavior, distinguishing between aggression and passion.Virat Kohli on why did he retire from Test cricket: 'It's time when you...'Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"Nothing (on whether he would change anything). What others call aggression, I call it passion. Is Virat Kohli aggressive? No. I think he is obsessed. Virat's aggression, people say, is a lot. I would say if he reduces that aggression, he won't be the same player."The careers of both cricketers took different paths following the 2011 World Cup victory. Kohli made his Test debut in the West Indies series, while Sreesanth did not participate in that tour.Sreesanth's final Test appearance for India came during the fourth Test against England in 2011, while Kohli's career continued to flourish.During the interview, Sreesanth also addressed the 2008 incident involving himself and Harbhajan Singh, where the latter slapped him after an IPL game in Mohali.The former pacer revealed how this incident affected his family, particularly his daughter's perception of Harbhajan Singh.PollDo you think Virat Kohli's aggression is essential to his success as a player?Yes, it defines his playing styleNo, he should tone it downIt doesn't matter, his skills are enoughNot sure"When I told my daughter, 'This is Bhajji pa, he's played with me', she straight away said, 'No, no, I won't say hi'. I couldn't understand why. In school, there may have been the odd conversation about it."Sreesanth elaborated on his attempts to explain the situation to his daughter and his current perspective on the incident."There are different stories doing the rounds. Then we tried explaining, but she said she still won't talk to him. The next day, when the legends tournament was going on, we explained that he was like our elder brother. I don't think Bhajji pa did that deliberately. It happened in the spur of the moment. It was just a learning experience for both of us."The incident has since become a significant talking point in Indian cricket history, with Harbhajan Singh previously expressing his desire to erase that moment from his life during an episode of "Kutti Stories with Ash."Both Sreesanth and Harbhajan Singh were prominent figures in Indian cricket during their active playing days, contributing to various successes for the national team, including the 2011 World Cup victory.The 42-year-old Sreesanth's international career came to an end shortly after the 2011 World Cup, with his last ODI being the World Cup final and his final Test match coming against England later that year.Throughout the interview, Sreesanth maintained a reflective stance on his career and experiences, indicating that he wouldn't change anything about his journey in cricket, despite the various challenges and controversies he faced.The conversation highlighted the complex dynamics of professional cricket, from on-field aggression to personal relationships between players, and how these aspects continue to influence their lives even after their playing careers.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Despite the setback, Pakistan Shaheens recovered, posting a total of 227 runs and ultimately securing a dominant 80-run victory. A mixup between two Pakistan Shaheens players resulted in a dreadful run out. (Image: X) A heated moment unfolded during a cricket match between Pakistan Shaheens and Bangladesh A when opening batter Nafay and Yasir Khan were involved in a run-out incident in the 12th over, leading to visible frustration and confrontation between the teammates. The incident occurred after the opening partnership had built a strong foundation of 118 runs in the first 11 overs, with both batters having scored half-centuries.The run-out occurred on the first ball of the 12th over when Khan faced right-arm pacer Mrittunjoy Chowdhury. Khan attempted to flick a ball that was angling across him into the leg side, which hit his pads and rolled across the pitch. Nafay immediately started running for a single while Khan hesitated to check if the ball was rolling back towards his stumps.Despite Khan's signal to stop, Nafay continued his run down the pitch. Khan took a step forward before deciding against the single, but by then, the wicketkeeper had nearly collected the ball. Although Nafay tried to make it back to his crease, the ball was thrown accurately to Chowdhury at the non-striker's end, who removed the bails with Nafay well short of his ground.The dismissal triggered an immediate and intense reaction from Nafay, who threw his bat onto the ground in frustration. He then turned towards Khan and displayed his anger through aggressive gestures, throwing his arms out and pointing at his partner.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

He returned figures of 2/40 in 10 overs (Photo by Matt King/Getty Images) Jasprit Bumrah’s rise to the top of India’s pace attack has been undisputed. Known for his distinctive action, accuracy and ability to deliver under pressure, Bumrah has become the go-to bowler for India across formats. But according to veteran pacer Ishant Sharma, his debut in 2016 was far more due to timing and a little bit of recommendation from the 36-year-old.. Speaking to former cricketer Padamjeet Sehrawat on YouTube, Ishant shared an incident from the 2015 Vijay Hazare Trophy final that left a lasting impression on him. Playing for Delhi against Gujarat in Bengaluru, Ishant saw Bumrah produce a match-winning spell.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!“I remember we were playing the List A match, I think it was in 2016.We were playing the final in Bengaluru, Delhi vs Gujarat. Uss time vo bhaagta tha, properly bhaagte hue bowling karta tha. Abhi jaisa (slow) nahi. He picked five wickets in that game,” Ishant recalled. Gujarat went on to win the title by 139 runs. The performance from Bunrah made Ishant to speak to then team mentor Ravi Shastri during India’s tour of Australia soon after. “After that, we went to Australia. I told Ravi bhai, ‘If we need anyone in this team, it’s Jasprit Bumrah.’ I told him about Bumrah’s action and his bowling. Ravi bhai was the mentor of the team. And look at his luck... someone got injured, and Bumrah came into the team. From there till now, his mindset and self-belief makes him stand out,” Ishant said.Jasprit Bumrah celebrates taking the wicket of Steve Smith during game five of the ODI Series match vs Australia in Sydney (Photo by Matt King/Getty Images) That injury was to Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who was ruled out before the final ODI of the 2016 series in Australia. Bumrah, not originally in the squad, was drafted in as a late replacement and made an immediate impact.

However, India has dominated in T20Is and rebounded from an ODI series loss to win the 2025 Champions Trophy, showcasing Gambhir's commitment to accountability and national pride. India cricket team head coach Gautam Gambhir (Ben Whitley/PA via AP) On Independence Day, Gautam Gambhir kept it simple but powerful. Posting a picture with the tricolour, he wrote, “My country, my identity, my life! Jai Hind!🇮🇳” — a message that resonated with fans across India. It was more than a patriotic caption; it was a reflection of a man whose cricketing journey has always been intertwined with the nation’s pride. Now serving as India’s head coach, Gambhir carries the same passion he once showed as an opener. His tenure, which began in July 2024, has already been full of highs, lows and intense scrutiny. In Test cricket, results have been mixed. India has played 15 Tests under him, winning five, losing eight and drawing two.IND vs ENG: When Gautam Gambhir lost his cool at Oval pitch curatorGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Gautam Gambhir tweet on XThe most recent Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy in England was a thrilling battle — India lost the first and third Tests, bounced back to win the second and final matches, with a high-scoring draw in Manchester sealing a 2-2 series result. It was a contest filled with tense finishes, resilient comebacks and moments that reminded fans of India’s fighting spirit.PollHow do you feel about Gautam Gambhir's impact as India's head coach so far?Very PositiveSomewhat PositiveNeutralNegative In white-ball cricket, Gambhir’s impact has been more immediate. India has dominated in T20Is, winning 13 out of 15 games, remaining unbeaten in series. ODIs saw an early stumble with a home series loss to Sri Lanka, but the team rebounded strongly, winning eight consecutive matches and lifting the 2025 Champions Trophy. Gambhir’s leadership style has sometimes drawn criticism for too much chopping and changing, but he remains steadfast in taking responsibility, famously saying, “We lose together, we win together.” For a man who scored 97 in the 2011 World Cup final and 75 in the 2007 T20 World Cup final, that sense of accountability and love for the country is nothing new. His Independence Day post was a reminder that, for him, cricket and patriotism have always gone hand in hand.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

The BCCI and team management will make crucial decisions about their roles. Suresh Raina supports retaining both players for their experience. Rohit and Kohli are due to play in Australia next. Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma (AFP Photo) Former India cricket stalwarts Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, who retired from Test cricket in May, face uncertainty about their international future in limited-overs formats as they approach their late 30s. While India's Test transition progresses smoothly with new captain Shubman Gill and others performing well, questions remain about the veteran duo's place in the team leading up to the 2027 World Cup, where they would be 40 and 39 years old, respectively.The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and team management under Gautam Gambhir will need to make crucial decisions about their roles, particularly with reports suggesting Rohit may soon be asked to step down as ODI captain to facilitate Gill's leadership transition.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Former India cricketer Suresh Raina has voiced strong support for retaining both players, highlighting their crucial experience in white-ball cricket."India don't have dependable players at No. 1 and No. 3 (in ODIs) at the moment, especially when chasing. Rohit and Virat's experience is very important. It's crucial for the seniors to stay involved with the juniors. Shubman (Gill) has done really well, but he needs players like Virat and Rohit," said Raina, who was part of India's 2011 World Cup-winning team, in an interview with Telecom Asia Sport.Both Rohit and Kohli demonstrated their continued value to Indian cricket during the recent Champions Trophy in the UAE, just five months after a disappointing Border-Gavaskar Trophy tour to Australia.Rohit earned the Player of the Match award in the final victory against New Zealand, while Kohli contributed significantly with an 84-run knock in the semi-final against Australia and a century against Pakistan."They have won the Champions Trophy, they have won the World Cups. Virat won the last IPL also. For the astute leadership they have shown during their respective careers, they need to be part of the dressing room," Raina emphasised.Statistics from the current decade (since 2020) underscore their consistent performances in ODI cricket. Kohli has scored 2,572 runs in 57 innings at an average of 50.43, including eight centuries and 19 fifties. Rohit has accumulated 2,224 runs in 51 innings at an average of 47.31, with four centuries and 15 fifties.The immediate future will see both players absent from India's T20 Asia Cup campaign and home Test matches in September. Their next anticipated international appearance will be during India's tour of Australia in October, featuring three ODIs beginning October 19 in Perth, followed by matches in Adelaide and Sydney.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

He also shared his thoughts on his son Aryaveer's cricket career, emphasizing the importance of handling pressure. File Pic: Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar NEW DELHI: Former India opener Virender Sehwag has revealed that he came close to retiring from ODI cricket in 2007-08, only to be convinced otherwise by batting legend Sachin Tendulkar.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Speaking on Padamjeet Sehrawat's podcast, Sehwag recalled the turbulent phase during India's tri-nation series against Australia and Sri Lanka Down Under, when he was dropped from the side by captain MS Dhoni after the first three matches.Sachin Tendulkar at 52: Power, Pride, and a Nation’s Pulse“In the 2007-08 series against Australia, I played the first three matches and then MS Dhoni dropped me from the side. I wasn't picked for a while after that. Then I felt that if I can't be a part of the playing XI, then there is no point in playing ODI cricket,” Sehwag said.PollDo you think Sehwag made the right decision to continue playing ODIs?Absolutely!Not really.Frustrated and ready to walk away, Sehwag approached Tendulkar to share his decision. What followed was a conversation that changed the course of his career.“I went to Tendulkar and said, ‘I am thinking of retiring from ODIs'. He said, ‘No. I went through a similar phase in 1999-2000, where I felt I should leave cricket. But that phase came and went. You are going through a trough, but it will pass. Don't make any decision when you are emotional. Give yourself some time and 1-2 series, and then take a call.'”Sehwag took the advice to heart, returned to the side, scored heavily in the following series, and went on to play a crucial role in India's 2011 World Cup-winning campaign.Sehwag went on to play 251 ODIs for India, amassing 8,273 runs at an average of 35.05 and a strike rate of 104.33, including 15 centuries and 38 fifties. Sehwag’s message for son AyraveerThe former opener also spoke about his son Aryaveer's budding cricket journey. Selected for Delhi's U-16 Vijay Merchant Trophy squad in December 2023, Aryaveer, Sehwag said, would inevitably face comparisons but should not take on undue pressure.“That pressure will always be on you, but you should not take that pressure. Pressure is something that you give, not take… Hope he goes on to play either for India or the Ranji Trophy,” Sehwag remarked.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

That's the best way to look at it,” Woakes said. “Obviously out of the sling and feel like I can move it a lot better now, which is good two weeks down the line.Ben Stokes press conference: On Mohammed Siraj, Chris Woakes batting with injury, 2-2 result“I suppose once you get a little bit more movement into it, feels a little bit more normal. But still a lot of work to do. Going to try and (stay) focused on the rehab and get it as strong as possible. Ideally not for surgery for now but we'll see how that goes and hopefully we can get it nice and strong again.”Earlier this month, Woakes had told BBC Sport he was weighing up whether to undergo surgery or opt solely for rehabilitation. For now, he is hoping to avoid going under the knife.The injury was a dramatic moment in the series decider against India.

Kumar highlighted Bumrah's significant impact even in a limited number of matches, citing his crucial contribution of 14 wickets in three Tests against England. He also noted Bumrah's increased confidence and maturity gained through years of consistent performance. Jasprit Bumrah NEW DELHI: India pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar has thrown his weight behind Jasprit Bumrah amid the ongoing debate over the star fast bowler’s workload management. Ahead of the 2025 Anderson–Tendulkar Trophy against England, the selectors decided that Bumrah would play only three of the five Tests — a move that sparked widespread discussion.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Speaking on the podcast Talk with Manvendra, Bhuvneshwar offered a strong defence of the decision. "Look, considering how many years Jasprit Bumrah has been playing and competing in all formats, it is tough for anyone to sustain that. And with the kind of bowling action Bumrah has, injuries can happen to him or to anyone," he said.How Jasprit Bumrah is preparing for Lord's Test - batting, bowling and lot of jokes!"I had no problem with him playing three out of five matches. If the selectors know what he can offer and are okay with it, it’s because they know he can still make a big impact in those three games. If a player might not play all five matches but will contribute significantly in three, that should be okay," he added.PollDo you agree with the selectors' decision to allow Bumrah to play only three out of five Tests?Yes, it's a smart move for his longevityNo, he should play all matchesBhuvneshwar highlighted the physical and mental demands Bumrah faces. "People don’t always understand how tough it is to keep playing for so many years across formats. Bumrah is always bowling in tough situations, which brings both mental and physical pressure. If you want a player to have a long career, you have to manage them somehow."Bumrah repaid the faith in style, bagging 14 wickets in his three appearances against England, including two five-wicket hauls.Reflecting on Bumrah’s journey, Bhuvneshwar said: "When he first came in, everyone could see there was something special. Skill-wise, nothing has changed — he was as good back then as he is now. But with years of performance comes confidence. Once you are established, you don’t panic if things go wrong. That maturity comes with age."With 207 international matches and 457 wickets to his name, Bumrah remains a cornerstone of India’s attack.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Four years later, in Melbourne, the men’s hockey team defeated Pakistan to claim gold, the nation’s first Olympic hockey title since independence and their sixth in a row overall.In 1996, tennis star Leander Paes captured bronze in Atlanta, becoming the first Asian to win an Olympic tennis medal and the only Indian to do so. Sydney 2000 brought another historic moment as weightlifter Karnam Malleswari became the first Indian woman to win an Olympic medal with her bronze. Beijing 2008 was a watershed: shooter Abhinav Bindra clinched India’s first-ever individual Olympic gold, while wrestler Sushil Kumar took bronze before upgrading to silver in London 2012, making him the first Indian with two individual Olympic medals.Tokyo 2020 (held in 2021) delivered another golden chapter when javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra won India’s first-ever Olympic gold in athletics. At Paris 2024, shooter Manu Bhaker became the first Indian to win two medals at the same Olympics, further enriching the nation’s sporting legacy.Beyond the Olympics, Indian sport has had its own landmark triumphs. In 1951, the national football team won Asian Games gold in New Delhi. The following year, India secured its maiden Test cricket victory against England in Chennai. Men’s hockey reached another peak in 1975, winning their first and only World Cup in Kuala Lumpur.In 1980, badminton great Prakash Padukone claimed the prestigious All England Open title, inspiring generations.

Under MS Dhoni, India won the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2007, the ODI World Cup in 2011, and the Champions Trophy in 2013 — making him the only captain to hold all three ICC white-ball titles. In 2024, India won the T20 World Cup under Rohit Sharma, ending a trophy drought since 2013, and went on to win the 2025 Champions Trophy as well.Recent years have brought fresh glories. In 2019, PV Sindhu became the first Indian to win the Badminton World Championship. In 2022, the men’s badminton team won the Thomas Cup. In 2023, Neeraj Chopra struck gold at the World Athletics Championships in Budapest. And at the 2024 Paris Paralympics, India recorded its best-ever medal haul of 29, rewriting the nation’s Paralympic history.From the wrestling mat to the cricket pitch, from hockey turf to athletics track, these moments have shaped India’s sporting soul — each victory a reminder that the nation’s dreams, once forged in dust, now shine on the world’s brightest stages.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Rohit Sharma (AFP Photo) NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma is leaving no stone unturned in his bid for an ODI comeback. The veteran opener was first spotted training under former teammate and renowned coach Abhishek Nayar, working hard to regain match fitness after a break from competitive cricket since the IPL 2025 wrapped up in early June. Determined to play ODIs until the 2027 World Cup, Rohit is pushing himself in the nets and beyond.A fresh video, now viral on social media, shows the 38-year-old hitting the ground at a Mumbai stadium.WATCH:Amid ongoing speculation about his international future, Rohit climbed to No. 2 in the latest ICC ODI batting rankings released on Wednesday. He leapfrogged Pakistan’s Babar Azam — who dropped to third after a poor ODI series in the Caribbean — and now sits on 756 points, just behind India’s Test skipper Shubman Gill (784). Former captain Virat Kohli remains fourth with 736 points.Rohit Sharma Unplugged: Funniest Press Conference MomentsBoth Rohit and Kohli, who retired from Test cricket earlier this year before India’s England tour, have reiterated their commitment to the 50-over format. The two could return in October’s three-match ODI series against Australia, with training already underway.Rohit, one of the ODI format’s greatest alongside Kohli, reached his career-best 882 rating points during the 2019 World Cup, when he struck a record five centuries in the tournament. He and Kohli last featured in ODIs during India’s Champions Trophy triumph in the UAE earlier this year.India currently have five batters inside the men’s ODI top 15 — Shreyas Iyer in eighth and KL Rahul in 15th join Gill, Rohit, and Kohli in the elite list.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

SUBSCRIBE NOW!Speaking on the podcast Talk with Manvendra, Bhuvneshwar revealed that the bond between him and Kohli has matured with time.IPL 2025 Final, RCB vs Punjab Kings: The wait will finally end in AhmedabadPollDo you believe that personal relationships affect team performance?Yes, they enhance performanceNo, they do not matterIt depends on the individuals“Things are different now. When we meet these days, we talk more about family or off-the-ground matters because everyone has a family now. We talk about how we are doing in life other than cricket. Earlier, when we weren’t married and were younger, it was more about the usual fun and jokes boys have. So that’s where the change has come,” Bhuvneshwar said.On the field, however, he insisted professionalism remains the driving force. “We never really need that bond to perform well. If RCB has picked me, Virat, or any other player, they want us to perform regardless of friendship. Everyone knows what they have to do on the ground. But off the ground, of course, things have changed. We’ve matured, we’ve grown older, so now the conversations are different,” he added.Bhuvneshwar enjoyed a strong season, taking 17 wickets in 14 matches, while Kohli amassed 657 runs in 15 innings. The pacer also lauded Rajat Patidar’s leadership during RCB’s title-winning run.“The best part was that since it was such an experienced team, Rajat didn’t have to do much. Where leadership was needed, he took decisions without hesitation. That’s a quality — knowing when to step in and when to let things be,” Bhuvneshwar said.He credited RCB’s balanced contributions for breaking their 18-year title drought. “This time, the biggest difference was that all players in the XI won matches at different times, in different situations. You can’t win a big tournament relying on just one or two players. Bowlers stepped up in some games, batters in others. In every stage, a new player emerged to win it for us,” he concluded.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

During the World Championship of Legends, India Champions refused to play Pakistan Champions. Harbhajan Singh advocates for the current team to follow suit in the Asia Cup, emphasizing that national interests outweigh sports, especially considering the sacrifices made by soldiers. Image credit: AFP NEW DELHI: Following the Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor, there has been a growing demand for India to boycott Pakistan across all fronts, including cricket. The sentiment gained momentum during the World Championship of Legends (WCL), when the India Champions refused to face the Pakistan Champions in both the group stage and the semifinals. The Indian squad, comprising stalwarts like Shikhar Dhawan, Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan Singh, Irfan Pathan, Suresh Raina, and Yusuf Pathan, stood firm in their decision.Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh, who has taken over 700 international wickets, made his stance clear, stating that “cricket is too small a thing in front of the nation.” India’s refusal to play Pakistan came in response to the gruesome Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed numerous innocent lives.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Harbhajan believes the current Indian team, led by Suryakumar Yadav, should take a similar stand in the upcoming Asia Cup and decline to face their arch-rivals."Jo dono deshon mein tensions hain, takraar hain, jab tak wo theek nahi hoti, hume cricket nahi khelni chahiye. This is my opinion. Ye bahut chhoti aur maamuli baat hai. Cricket bahut chhoti cheez hai desh ke aage [As long as the tensions and disputes between the two countries remain unresolved, we should not play cricket. This is my opinion. Cricket is a very small thing compared to the nation]," Harbhajan told TimesofIndia.com in an interview."For me, humare desh ka wo jawan jo sarhad par khada hua hai, unki families jo kai baar unko nahi dekh paati hain, unki shahadat ho jaati hai, wo ghar wapas nahi laut paate hain — unki itni badi sacrifice hoti hai hum sabke liye. Toh ye to bahut chhoti si baat hai (on boycotting Pakistan matches) ki hum ek cricket match na chhod sakein? Ye bahut chhoti si baat hai [For me, the soldier who stands on the border, whose family often doesn’t get to see him, who sometimes sacrifices his life and never returns home — their sacrifice is so immense for all of us. Compared to that, (on boycotting Pakistan matches) this is a very small thing — that we can’t even skip playing one cricket match. It’s a very small matter]," Harbhajan said."Humari government ka bhi ek naara hai ki 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte.' Ye baat bilkul theek hai. Ye to ho nahi sakta ki sarhad par ladai ho, tanaav ho aur hum cricket khelne chale jaayein. Jab tak ye badi cheezein settle nahi hoti hain, cricket bahut chhoti si cheez hai. Nation always comes first [Our government also has a slogan: ‘Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte.’ This is absolutely correct. It cannot be that there’s fighting on the border, tensions between the two nations, and we go to play cricket. Until these big issues are resolved, cricket is a very small matter. The nation always comes first]," Harbhajan said."Jo bhi hamara wajood hai wo iss desh ki wajah se hai, aur chahe wo khiladi ho, abhineta ho ya koi bhi ho, desh se bada koi nahi hota hai. Desh jo hai wo sabse aage hai, aur desh ke prati jo hamare farz bante hain, wo hume nibhane chahiye. Cricket match na khelna bahut maamuli si cheez hai desh ke saamne [Whatever our identity is, it’s because of this country. Whether you are a player, an actor, or anyone else — no one is bigger than the nation. The country comes first, and the duties we owe to it must be fulfilled. Not playing a cricket match is nothing compared to the importance of the nation]," the former spinner said."Humare sarhad pe bhai khade hue hain, jo hume protect kar rahe hain, humare desh ko protect kar rahe hain — unke hausle dekho, wo kitna bada dil leke waha pe khade hue hain. Aur unke parivaar par kya beetati hai jab wo ghar wapas nahi aate. Aur hum cricket khelne chale jaate hain [At the border, our brothers are standing, protecting us and our country. Look at their courage, the big hearts with which they serve. Think about what their families go through when they don’t return home. And here we are, playing cricket]," he said."Hum unko itni importance kyun dete hain? Are they that important? Are they that important ki har news channel unko chalaye? When you have boycotted them, when you don't want to talk to them, then why show them here? This is the duty of the media — to stop this. They shouldn't be adding fuel to the fire. As I said, cricketers shouldn't be shaking hands with the Pakistan players, but the media shouldn't be showing them and their reactions on television either. They are sitting in their country and can say whatever they want, but we shouldn’t be highlighting them. Aisa bhi koi bayaan nahi hai jiska koi sir aur pair ho, aur agar koi ulta bayaan deta hai to usko phir jawaab denge," he said.India are defending champions. They defeated Sri Lanka by 10 wickets in the last edition of Asia Cup to clinch their eighth title — the most by any country in the competition.The Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee is likely to select the squad for the Asia Cup soon.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

He recalled the pacer's impressive performance in the 2015 Vijay Hazare Trophy final. Ishant then suggested Bumrah to Ravi Shastri during the Australia tour.

Jasprit Bumrah celebrates taking the wicket of Steve Smith of Australia during game five of the ODI series match vs Australia. He returned figures of 2/40 in 10 overs (Photo by Matt King/Getty Images) Jasprit Bumrah’s rise to the top of India’s pace attack has been undisputed. Known for his distinctive action, accuracy and ability to deliver under pressure, Bumrah has become the go-to bowler for India across formats. But according to veteran pacer Ishant Sharma, his debut in 2016 was far more due to timing and a little bit of recommendation from the 36-year-old.. Speaking to former cricketer Padamjeet Sehrawat on YouTube, Ishant shared an incident from the 2015 Vijay Hazare Trophy final that left a lasting impression on him. Playing for Delhi against Gujarat in Bengaluru, Ishant saw Bumrah produce a match-winning spell.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!“I remember we were playing the List A match, I think it was in 2016.We were playing the final in Bengaluru, Delhi vs Gujarat. Uss time vo bhaagta tha, properly bhaagte hue bowling karta tha. Abhi jaisa (slow) nahi. He picked five wickets in that game,” Ishant recalled. Gujarat went on to win the title by 139 runs. The performance from Bunrah made Ishant to speak to then team mentor Ravi Shastri during India’s tour of Australia soon after. “After that, we went to Australia. I told Ravi bhai, ‘If we need anyone in this team, it’s Jasprit Bumrah.’ I told him about Bumrah’s action and his bowling. Ravi bhai was the mentor of the team. And look at his luck... someone got injured, and Bumrah came into the team. From there till now, his mindset and self-belief makes him stand out,” Ishant said.Jasprit Bumrah celebrates taking the wicket of Steve Smith during game five of the ODI Series match vs Australia in Sydney (Photo by Matt King/Getty Images) That injury was to Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who was ruled out before the final ODI of the 2016 series in Australia. Bumrah, not originally in the squad, was drafted in as a late replacement and made an immediate impact. PollWas Ishant Sharma's recommendation crucial for Bumrah's inclusion in the team?Absolutely, it made a differenceNo, he would have made it with his skill anywayOn debut, he took 2/40 in 10 overs, helping India to a six-wicket win, which was also their only victory in the five-match series.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Erling Haaland, Mohamed Salah and Viktor Gyokeres (L-R) (Images via Getty Images) The Premier League is back in action on Friday, with champions Liverpool beginning their title defence at Anfield against Bournemouth. Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea, who finished in the top four last season once again look like the most viable contenders for the title of league champions.LiverpoolFlorian Wirtz of Liverpool during the pre-season friendly match between Liverpool vs Athletic Bilbao at Anfield (Photo by Carl Recine/Getty Images)Liverpool, coming on the back of a dominant campaign under Arne Slot, have had a busy summer to say the least. Big-money arrivals Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike are expected to spearhead the attack, while Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez bolster the full-back positions.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez have departed, with Mohamed Salah now surrounded by a very different forward line. The Egyptian's record-breaking season that featured 29 goals and 18 assists will be hard to replicate. But surrounded by younger, more clinical players, his role may evolve. Defensively, they're still on the lookout. Moves for Marc Guéhi and Giovanni Leoni are all but finalised.ArsenalViktor Gyokeres Arsenal has a diving header saved during the pre-season friendly match between Arsenal and Athletic Club at Emirates Stadium (Photo by Alex Pantling/Getty Images)Arsenal, after painstakingly coming close to the title, have addressed depth and injuries by bringing in Martin Zubimendi, Viktor Gyokeres and Noni Madueke. With several important players missing large parts of last season, Mikel Arteta will hope for a fitter, more consistent campaign.With Gyokeres home, Arteta's men will look to banish the demons of last season, where they made several chances, but failed to convert them into goals.Manchester CityTijjani Reijnders of Manchester City FC celebrates after scoring his team's second goal during Pre-Season Friendly match vs Palermo FC (Photo by Maurizio Lagana/Getty Images)Manchester City, despite the disastrous start to their campaign last season, finished 13 points behind Liverpool in third place. They need to answer questions over their defence despite new signings Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Aït-Nouri and Rayan Cherki.With Rodri facing another setback during the FIFA Club World Cup, City will face the exact same problem that hounded them last season - the link that connects their defence to midfield. With Mateo Kovacic and Phil Foden also sidelined for the immediate future, Pep Guardiola has a gargantuan task at hand - to ensure that they don't stumble in similar fashion this time around.ChelseaChelsea have had a busy summer, like any other. Can Enzo Maresca find balance amidst so many arrivals and departures? (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)Chelsea, like every other summer in recent memory, has been extremely active in the transfer market. Their fourth place finish last season was made better when they schooled Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final.Their rapid squad overhaul, adding eight major signings including João Pedro and Jamie Gittens are positive signs. Cole Palmer’s sensational year and Moisés Caicedo’s evolving influence in midfield give reason for optimism, yet the constant changes in squad composition may make things difficult.The Londoners lifted the Conference League title last year, but it's high time that they stamp their authority domestically as well. Can they answer the question of success without stability? Only time will tell.Manchester United and the restMatheus Cunha and Diogo Dalot of Manchester United react during the penalty shootout during the pre-season friendly match vs Fiorentina at Old Trafford (Photo by Matt McNulty/Getty Images)While the title may not be their realistic goal, as the new season begins, a bunch of Premier League clubs find themselves in the middle. They're not quite title contenders, but a change in fortune or a headstart may see them compete with the best for European slots. Some are looking for identity, others for a leap forward, and a few for stability.Manchester United have rebuilt their forward line with Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha after a goal-starved campaign. But their midfield depth remains thin, with Bruno Fernandes, Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro the only senior options. This remains the same set of options that they had in a disappointing campaign. Ruben Amorim's time in charge saw them endure their 'worst' season ever as they finished 15th. With Amorim set to begin his first full season, fans can only hope that they start behaving like a big club - something they've found difficult to do in a few years.Newcastle United begin with uncertainty, given that their star striker Alexander Isak’s future remains in the balance. He scored over a third of their league goals last season, and replacing him mid-window would be a difficult task. Eddie Howe’s side ended last season in strong form and lifted the EFL Cup. New signing Anthony Elanga adds blistering pace, boasting 36.1 km/h last season, but their attacking set-up may not be clear until the window closes. Isak has been linked to Liverpool and a big-money move to the Saudi Pro League as well.PollWho do you think will win the Premier League title this season?LiverpoolArsenalManchester CityChelseaAston Villa have kept changes minimal, adding striker Evann Guessand from Nice. With Morgan Rogers and Youri Tielemans at their best in the middle of the park, Guessand’s presence could sharpen the attack if he slots in at his new club. However, the squad is largely the same as last year’s sixth-place finishers, leaving questions about whether they’ve done enough to push on. Unai Emery will have to make do as his team will also be playing European football for the third season in a row after their sixth place finish last season. While they have a solid team capable of progressing to the knockouts, can they manage to do it without Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio is the question.Tottenham Hotspur have parted ways with Ange Postecoglou and are banking on Thomas Frank to steer them upwards after a season that saw them barely avoid relegation. Frank has powered up the defence with new centre-backs and João Palhinha on loan. Yet with Son Heung-Min gone and James Maddison sidelined, the attack rests on Mohammed Kudus and young prospect Mathys Tel. Can Spurs avoid embarrassment this time around and force a top-half finish? The answer will heavily rest on how well the new boss gets his players to play his game.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

The policy includes ethical practices and fair play. Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya ensured passage of the National Sports Governance Bill. Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses the nation from the rampart of the Red Fort during Independence Day celebrations in New Delhi (AP Photo/Manish Swarup) Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday stressed the importance of sports in shaping India’s future, linking it to the country’s goal of becoming a developed nation. Speaking from the Red Fort during his Independence Day address, Modi said the recently approved National Sports Policy (NSP) 2025 would strengthen the sporting ecosystem from the grassroots to the Olympics. “Sports is an essential aspect of development and I am happy, that from the time when parents used to scoff at children spending time in sports, we have reached a point where it has changed. Now, parents are happy if children take interest in sports,” Modi said as quoted by PTI. He described it as a “good omen” for the nation.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! The NSP 2025, cleared by the Union Cabinet last month, replaces the two-decade-old National Sports Policy 2001. It aims to create a strong and inclusive sporting structure, with measures to ensure ethical practices, fair play, and healthy competition. The framework includes national agencies, inter-ministerial committees, and funding initiatives such as “Adopt an Athlete”, “Adopt a District”, and “One Corporate-One Sport”. “To promote sports, we have come up with the National Sports Policy after several decades. It would ensure development of sports, from school to the Olympics. We will develop an ecosystem whether it is coaching, fitness or infrastructure… that penetrates the farthest corner of the country,” the Prime Minister said. Within weeks of the policy’s approval, Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya also ensured the passage of the National Sports Governance Bill in Parliament, introducing a stricter regulatory framework for National Sports Federations and a formal dispute resolution mechanism. The Prime Minister also said that fitness is integral to sporting culture and urged citizens to address the growing obesity problem. “When I talk of fitness and sports, I want to talk about obesity, which is a huge problem for the country. It is predicted that every third person is expected to be obese in future, we have to reduce consumption of oil to win this war on obesity,” he said.PollHow important do you think sport is in shaping a nation's future?Extremely importantVaries from person to personNot important Modi added that the government’s efforts, including the Khelo Bharat Policy, are focused on building a robust and inclusive sports culture. “From school-level games to the Olympics, our goal is to build a complete and robust ecosystem for sports,” he said.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

FC Barcelona players pose for a team photo prior to the Joan Gamper Trophy match vs Como1907 at Estadi Johan Cruyff (Photo by Judit Cartiel/Getty Images) While Barcelona thrilled on their way to winning La Liga last season, scoring 102 goals in the process, coach Hansi Flick accepts this season his team need to improve defensively.With teenager Lamine Yamal and Raphinha shining in attack, the Catalan giants proved an irresistible force as they claimed a domestic treble.However the German coach's high-pressing defensive line sometimes left Barcelona high and dry at the back, even as it made for frequently gripping, end-to-end matches.The team's 7-6 Champions League semi-final aggregate defeat by Inter Milan was a prime example of the risks inherent in their set-up."For me, it's not always fun, sometimes I really suffer a lot," admitted Flick in May after Barca beat rivals Real Madrid 4-3 in a wild Clasico battle to move to the brink of the title."I'm really happy with what we are doing (in general), and of course, football is a game of making mistakes. Hopefully, we can make things better and make fewer mistakes."The coach made a pledge before the summer break."I know that we have to improve (defensively) and we will do it next season," vowed Flick.Whether Barca can maintain the same verve in attack is up for debate even before any defensive considerations.Raphinha, 28, had the best season of his career, which will be hard to repeat, while striker Robert Lewandowski turns 37 later in August.Yamal, who has taken former Barca great Lionel Messi's hallowed number 10 shirt, turned 18 in July and is his team's greatest hope in the months and years ahead.Limited spending powerBarcelona signed Rashford on loan for the season with an option to buy (Photo by Alex Caparros/Getty Images)While Real Madrid have been able to spend over 172 million euros ($200 million) on new arrivals Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dean Huijsen, Alvaro Carreras and Franco Mastantuono, as well as hiring Xabi Alonso as coach, Barcelona's poor financial state means their activity in the transfer market has been limited.The Catalans believe their youngsters like Yamal, centre-back Pau Cubarsi, 18, and midfielder Pedri, still only 22 despite his experience, will continue to grow and improve.They brought in Marcus Rashford on a season-long loan from Manchester United to try and revive the English attacker's career and reap the benefits of his huge potential, giving Flick more quality to rotate with.Barcelona did make one important permanent signing this summer in Espanyol goalkeeper Joan Garcia, improving arguably the weakest area of their team.Wojciech Szczesny filled in admirably after coming out of retirement to replace the injured veteran Marc-Andre ter Stegen last season, but is expected to take a reserve role behind the new arrival from Barca's city rivals.Garcia is in line to start as Barca kick off their campaign at Mallorca on August 16.Another hope for the champions is that the return to the Spotify Camp Nou strengthens them.While the Olympic Stadium on the city's Montjuic hill has proven a pleasant stand-in for the past two seasons, it lacks the atmosphere and grandeur of Barcelona's traditional home.The Catalans plan to return there for the fourth league game of the season after the first three are on the road, against Valencia on September 13 or 14.However Barca's entry date has been pushed back numerous times, initially planned for November 2024, and there could be further disruption.Regardless, barring disaster Barca will be back there by the time they host Real Madrid in May 2026, with that game potentially decisive in the title race.Given Flick's side started last season as underdogs to Madrid, that they are favourites to retain the title this time around cannot be taken too seriously.The key may be whether Flick is able to set the team up in a sturdier way without losing any of their attacking edge.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Real Madrid, now under Xabi Alonso, faces challenges with fitting into the new regime, early absences and concerns about fatigue. New signings in defence aim to bolster the squad as they navigate a demanding start to the season with high expectations. Trent Alexander-Arnold, Lamine Yamal and Julian Alvarez (Images via Getty Images) With Real Madrid aiming to wrestle the Spanish title back from champions Barcelona, here's a look at five talking points as the La Liga season begins on Friday.Alonso's challengeCarlo Ancelotti's Real Madrid were dismantled on a regular basis by rivals Barcelona last season, who triumphed in all four meetings between the sides as well as winning La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the Spanish Super Cup.The Italian departed, to be replaced by former Madrid midfielder Xabi Alonso, who has work on his hands to help revive them despite a squad boasting numerous star names including Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior.Madrid were thrashed 4-0 by Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup semi-finals and it remains to be seen how playing in the competition will impact squad fatigue and preparation for the new season.Defenders Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dean Huijsen give Alonso more options than Ancelotti had last season, along with Dani Carvajal's return from a long-term knee injury.However Madrid could be short in midfield after Luka Modric's departure and with Jude Bellingham set to be out until October after shoulder surgery.Can Yamal maintain level?Lamine Yamal, now 18 and wearing No 10, will carry the weight of his side's success going into the new season (Photo by Alex Caparros/Getty Images)Barcelona excelled in attack last season and much of that was down to skilful teenage star Lamine Yamal.The Spain international turned 18 in July and has already made over 100 appearances for the club, becoming the Catalans' key player going forward.If Flick's side are to defend their title and push on for more in the Champions League, as they prepare to return to their rebuilt Camp Nou stadium, the winger maintaining his world-class level is essential.Yamal took former Barca all-time great Lionel Messi's number 10 shirt in July and insists he is forging his own path at the club.After helping his country triumph at Euro 2024, Yamal will also have his eye on the 2026 World Cup next summer.If new arrival Marcus Rashford hits the ground running coach Hansi Flick may be able to give Yamal the occasional rest, moving Raphinha over to the right. Atletico reshuffleAfter a poor end to the previous campaign and a surprise group stage Club World Cup elimination, Diego Simeone's Atletico took action this summer.They brought in playmaker Alex Baena from Villarreal and Real Betis' Johnny Cardoso to provide new midfield impetus, as well as several other new recruits.Long-time Atletico players Angel Correa, Rodrigo De Paul, Saul Niguez depart, among others.Despite the strength of their squad and Simeone's reputation as one of the best coaches in the world -- and the highest paid in Europe -- Atletico have won just three trophies in the last decade, La Liga in 2021 and both the Europa League and the UEFA Super Cup in 2018.Questions over whether Simeone has taken them as far as he can will quickly rear up if things start to go wrong. Cazorla's OviedoSpanish midfield maestro Santi Cazorla penned a new one-year deal with Real Oviedo for their return to Spain's top flight after a 24-year absence.It is a miraculous finale for the 40-year-old -- a member of the Spain side that won the 2008 and 2012 Euro titles -- who came close to losing his right leg due to his ankle bone going soft when he was at Arsenal. Former Arsenal playmaker Cazorla had a key role in the team's rise to La Liga, when he re-joined them he initially offered to play for nothing but was obliged under the rules to accept the minimum wage, and in their first match they take on his former side Villarreal.Whether he will be able to have as much of an impact this season is debatable but Cazorla will get a fine send-off at grounds around the country when Oviedo hit the road.Fresh startsReal Sociedad and Sevilla have made new managerial appointments as they try to bounce back from poor 2024-25 campaigns.After seven years at the helm Real's Imanol Alguacil stepped down and has been replaced by reserve team coach Sergio Francisco.PollWho do you think will win La Liga this season?BarcelonaReal MadridAtletico MadridAnother teamMeanwhile Matias Almeyda takes over at a Sevilla side which finished 17th last season and sacked coach Francesco Garcia Pimienta in April.Both clubs have been among the strongest in Spain over the past decade but have fallen from grace.Real Sociedad in particular will have to find a way to move forward after the departure of key midfielder Martin Zubimendi to Arsenal.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

India cricket team head coach Gautam Gambhir (Ben Whitley/PA via AP) On Independence Day, Gautam Gambhir kept it simple but powerful. Posting a picture with the tricolour, he wrote, “My country, my identity, my life! Jai Hind!🇮🇳” — a message that resonated with fans across India. It was more than a patriotic caption; it was a reflection of a man whose cricketing journey has always been intertwined with the nation’s pride. Now serving as India’s head coach, Gambhir carries the same passion he once showed as an opener. His tenure, which began in July 2024, has already been full of highs, lows and intense scrutiny. In Test cricket, results have been mixed. India has played 15 Tests under him, winning five, losing eight and drawing two.IND vs ENG: When Gautam Gambhir lost his cool at Oval pitch curatorGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Gautam Gambhir tweet on XThe most recent Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy in England was a thrilling battle — India lost the first and third Tests, bounced back to win the second and final matches, with a high-scoring draw in Manchester sealing a 2-2 series result. It was a contest filled with tense finishes, resilient comebacks and moments that reminded fans of India’s fighting spirit.PollHow do you feel about Gautam Gambhir's impact as India's head coach so far?Very PositiveSomewhat PositiveNeutralNegative In white-ball cricket, Gambhir’s impact has been more immediate. India has dominated in T20Is, winning 13 out of 15 games, remaining unbeaten in series. ODIs saw an early stumble with a home series loss to Sri Lanka, but the team rebounded strongly, winning eight consecutive matches and lifting the 2025 Champions Trophy. Gambhir’s leadership style has sometimes drawn criticism for too much chopping and changing, but he remains steadfast in taking responsibility, famously saying, “We lose together, we win together.” For a man who scored 97 in the 2011 World Cup final and 75 in the 2007 T20 World Cup final, that sense of accountability and love for the country is nothing new. His Independence Day post was a reminder that, for him, cricket and patriotism have always gone hand in hand.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

(Image: X) A heated moment unfolded during a cricket match between Pakistan Shaheens and Bangladesh A when opening batter Nafay and Yasir Khan were involved in a run-out incident in the 12th over, leading to visible frustration and confrontation between the teammates. The incident occurred after the opening partnership had built a strong foundation of 118 runs in the first 11 overs, with both batters having scored half-centuries.The run-out occurred on the first ball of the 12th over when Khan faced right-arm pacer Mrittunjoy Chowdhury. Khan attempted to flick a ball that was angling across him into the leg side, which hit his pads and rolled across the pitch. Nafay immediately started running for a single while Khan hesitated to check if the ball was rolling back towards his stumps.Despite Khan's signal to stop, Nafay continued his run down the pitch. Khan took a step forward before deciding against the single, but by then, the wicketkeeper had nearly collected the ball. Although Nafay tried to make it back to his crease, the ball was thrown accurately to Chowdhury at the non-striker's end, who removed the bails with Nafay well short of his ground.The dismissal triggered an immediate and intense reaction from Nafay, who threw his bat onto the ground in frustration. He then turned towards Khan and displayed his anger through aggressive gestures, throwing his arms out and pointing at his partner.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

The BCCI and team management will make crucial decisions about their roles. Suresh Raina supports retaining both players for their experience. Rohit and Kohli are due to play in Australia next. Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma (AFP Photo) Former India cricket stalwarts Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, who retired from Test cricket in May, face uncertainty about their international future in limited-overs formats as they approach their late 30s. While India's Test transition progresses smoothly with new captain Shubman Gill and others performing well, questions remain about the veteran duo's place in the team leading up to the 2027 World Cup, where they would be 40 and 39 years old, respectively.The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and team management under Gautam Gambhir will need to make crucial decisions about their roles, particularly with reports suggesting Rohit may soon be asked to step down as ODI captain to facilitate Gill's leadership transition.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Former India cricketer Suresh Raina has voiced strong support for retaining both players, highlighting their crucial experience in white-ball cricket."India don't have dependable players at No. 1 and No. 3 (in ODIs) at the moment, especially when chasing. Rohit and Virat's experience is very important. It's crucial for the seniors to stay involved with the juniors. Shubman (Gill) has done really well, but he needs players like Virat and Rohit," said Raina, who was part of India's 2011 World Cup-winning team, in an interview with Telecom Asia Sport.Both Rohit and Kohli demonstrated their continued value to Indian cricket during the recent Champions Trophy in the UAE, just five months after a disappointing Border-Gavaskar Trophy tour to Australia.Rohit earned the Player of the Match award in the final victory against New Zealand, while Kohli contributed significantly with an 84-run knock in the semi-final against Australia and a century against Pakistan."They have won the Champions Trophy, they have won the World Cups. Virat won the last IPL also. For the astute leadership they have shown during their respective careers, they need to be part of the dressing room," Raina emphasised.Statistics from the current decade (since 2020) underscore their consistent performances in ODI cricket. Kohli has scored 2,572 runs in 57 innings at an average of 50.43, including eight centuries and 19 fifties. Rohit has accumulated 2,224 runs in 51 innings at an average of 47.31, with four centuries and 15 fifties.The immediate future will see both players absent from India's T20 Asia Cup campaign and home Test matches in September. Their next anticipated international appearance will be during India's tour of Australia in October, featuring three ODIs beginning October 19 in Perth, followed by matches in Adelaide and Sydney.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

New Delhi: Stray dogs being fed on a roadside at KG Marg, in New Delhi. (PTI Photo)  Former India cricket captain Kapil Dev has called on Delhi authorities to provide stray dogs with a better life, following a recent Supreme Court directive to move them to shelter homes. The order instructed the Delhi government and other relevant bodies to remove stray dogs from public spaces and house them in designated shelters. The decision has sparked controversy among animal rights activists, who fear challenges in its implementation. In a video message for animal welfare group Petfamilia, Kapil Dev said he believed dogs were among the most beautiful creatures and appealed to officials to treat them with compassion. “I request the authorities to look after them, give them a better life, and not throw them out,” he said.‘Step Back on Humane Policy’ Rahul Gandhi Criticises SC Ruling on Stray Dog RelocationGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! The matter returned to court after another bench questioned why authorities had begun picking up animals even before the earlier order was made public. The bench also criticised the lack of proper implementation of animal control guidelines, which has contributed to the current situation.PollWhat is your stance on the Supreme Court's directive to shelter stray dogs?Supportive of the directiveOpposed to itNeed more informationIndifferent A bench comprising Justice Vikram Nath, Justice Sandeep Mehta, and Justice NV Anjaria heard the case this morning. This followed an August 11 order by a two-judge bench of Justice JB Pardiwala and Justice R Mahadevan, which led to protests by animal lovers against the removal of strays from residential areas. Representing the Delhi government, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta highlighted incidents of stray dog attacks on children, some resulting in fatalities from rabies. He argued that sterilisation alone cannot prevent rabies and stressed that while dogs should not be killed, they need to be separated from public spaces for safety reasons. Citing government data, he said there were 37 lakh dog bite cases in the last year, adding that the issue requires urgent court intervention.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Virat Kohli of India (Photo by Francois Nel/Getty Images) Former Indian cricketer S Sreesanth has shared his views on Virat Kohli's aggressive playing style and reflected on his own career experiences during a conversation with sports commentator Padamjeet Sehrawat on his YouTube channel. Sreesanth, who was part of India's 2011 World Cup-winning team alongside Kohli, emphasized that Kohli's aggressive demeanor is essential to his success as a player.Sreesanth expressed his perspective on Kohli's on-field behavior, distinguishing between aggression and passion.Virat Kohli on why did he retire from Test cricket: 'It's time when you...'Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"Nothing (on whether he would change anything). What others call aggression, I call it passion. Is Virat Kohli aggressive? No. I think he is obsessed. Virat's aggression, people say, is a lot. I would say if he reduces that aggression, he won't be the same player."The careers of both cricketers took different paths following the 2011 World Cup victory. Kohli made his Test debut in the West Indies series, while Sreesanth did not participate in that tour.Sreesanth's final Test appearance for India came during the fourth Test against England in 2011, while Kohli's career continued to flourish.During the interview, Sreesanth also addressed the 2008 incident involving himself and Harbhajan Singh, where the latter slapped him after an IPL game in Mohali.The former pacer revealed how this incident affected his family, particularly his daughter's perception of Harbhajan Singh.PollDo you think Virat Kohli's aggression is essential to his success as a player?Yes, it defines his playing styleNo, he should tone it downIt doesn't matter, his skills are enoughNot sure"When I told my daughter, 'This is Bhajji pa, he's played with me', she straight away said, 'No, no, I won't say hi'. I couldn't understand why. In school, there may have been the odd conversation about it."Sreesanth elaborated on his attempts to explain the situation to his daughter and his current perspective on the incident."There are different stories doing the rounds. Then we tried explaining, but she said she still won't talk to him. The next day, when the legends tournament was going on, we explained that he was like our elder brother. I don't think Bhajji pa did that deliberately. It happened in the spur of the moment. It was just a learning experience for both of us."The incident has since become a significant talking point in Indian cricket history, with Harbhajan Singh previously expressing his desire to erase that moment from his life during an episode of "Kutti Stories with Ash."Both Sreesanth and Harbhajan Singh were prominent figures in Indian cricket during their active playing days, contributing to various successes for the national team, including the 2011 World Cup victory.The 42-year-old Sreesanth's international career came to an end shortly after the 2011 World Cup, with his last ODI being the World Cup final and his final Test match coming against England later that year.Throughout the interview, Sreesanth maintained a reflective stance on his career and experiences, indicating that he wouldn't change anything about his journey in cricket, despite the various challenges and controversies he faced.The conversation highlighted the complex dynamics of professional cricket, from on-field aggression to personal relationships between players, and how these aspects continue to influence their lives even after their playing careers.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Focused on continuous improvement, he dismisses the notion of limits and prioritizes the present moment. Armand Duplantis of Sweden  (Tamas Vasvari/MTI via AP) Mumbai: Armand ‘Mondo’ Duplantis is the man who keeps rewriting the numbers in pole vault. ‘Numbers’ is putting it very lightly. They’re World Records, and he has set 13 of them. But ask him about the one number everyone wants to know, his ultimate limit, and he shrugs it off.“I’m not a big numbers guy… I don’t really care about limits,” he says. “I know there’s more to come, and I’m going to keep pushing it.”Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!It’s not false modesty. It’s the way the 25-year-old operates. Living in the present, chasing the perfect jump, not the statistic. “I try to maximise and achieve the most that I can in the now,” he said during an interaction with world media on Thursday. “I think about it a lot less than you would probably imagine.”Fresh from another world record, 6.29m in Budapest, Duplantis sounds as if he has already moved on. “I feel really good,” he says. “Of course, I’m showing that I’m in good shape and everything’s going as I would like for it at this time of the season. Super happy about the jam in Budapest. It was a super amazing night for me.”There’s no long bask in the glory. “I just have this real internal drive and motivation that I just want to keep being better,” he says.That drive comes with what he calls “short-term memory loss” about his achievements. “I probably don’t soak in and forget my accomplishments too quickly. It takes a few days and then I just forget what I did and then I just start looking towards the next thing,” he says. “I always figure out a way to make new goals and look forward. And it becomes probably even quicker and quicker now too.”PollWhat do you think is more beneficial for a pole vaulter: technique or mental preparation?TechniqueMental preparationBoth equallyThis constant reset is, in his mind, simply “the way that I’m built… I just always look forward in that kind of way.”Tokyo dreamsBreaking a world record doesn’t come with instant calm. “It’s always a bit difficult to find that deep sleep cycle after a world record because of the excitement and what not,” he admits. “But no, I feel really good… just trying to keep pushing forward.”That push is now aimed at Tokyo, the city where he won his first Olympic gold in 2021, in front of empty stands. “I’m super excited to go back to the stadium that I won my first Olympic gold… this time with fans,” he says, talking about the World Championships in Tokyo next month. “I haven’t been this excited about a competition, maybe ever.”The memory of that silent victory still lingers. “It was a little bit more like a spooky and eerie type of feeling when I was in there because of all the circumstances,” he recalls. The difference, he believes, could be telling. “I’d like to say that the spectators probably would have given me that little push to get over it,” he says of his near miss at 6.19m during those Games.Not a ‘lab rat’Pole vault has been his life since childhood, guided by his parents, but Duplantis is quick to dismiss one persistent myth. “It’s a very common misconception that I was like this lab rat and I was forced to evolve from a very young age,” he says. “I have other brothers and other siblings… my other brother was a baseball player and he liked baseball a lot more than pole vaulting. And there was no problem with that. My parents let us create our own path.”It’s why his advice to young athletes is about trying different sports and choosing what they enjoy most. “You have to let kids be kids at the end of the day,” he says.Calm on the runwayFor an event that requires sprinting down a runway before vaulting over six metres, Duplantis stays strikingly calm. “I get nervous in, like, an exciting way,” he explains. “I don’t get scared. If you’re scared and you have any type of negative thoughts… that’s usually a recipe for failure.”It’s a mental strength he prizes as much as his technique. “Zen is something that suits me very well and something that I can separate myself from most athletes and most jumpers,” he says.Fuel from rivalsThis year, Greek vaulter Emmanuel Karalis has emerged as a serious challenger. “It’s great to see… it pushes me,” Duplantis says. “Coming off his last few meets… it gave me a lot of energy and motivation.”Still, he knows reputation alone doesn’t win competitions. “They don’t just give me the trophy because I’m the favourite… I still have to go out there and I have to compete and I have to be on my A game and I have to earn my title as the one that’s going to be the best and last man standing on that day every time,” he says. “Everything’s earned.”No magic numberIn an era where some athletics records stand for decades, Duplantis’ constant progression is rare. But he insists there is no magic number taped to his bedroom wall. “I’m not an OCD person… I like to let things just kind of happen naturally,” he says. “I know that there’s a lot more and that I’m going to keep jumping higher… but I don’t really care about numbers in that way.”Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Representational Image of a Track field. Bengaluru: With the World Athletics Council approving new regulations for athletes to compete in the women’s category for world ranking competitions, the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) has informed top athletes and coaches that all female athletes who make the grade should undergo ‘SRY gene test’ to be eligible to compete in next month’s World Championships to be held in Tokyo. “All female athletes who meet the qualification standards for the World Athletics Championships should undergo the SRY gene test in consultation with the Athletics Federation of India,” AFI said in a communication to the athletes and coaches. “All concerned are requested to ensure compliance with the above requirement at the earliest, failing which the concerned athlete shall not be permitted to compete in the female category,” Shailesh Kumar, chairman of AFI’s medical commission, said in the letter.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! AFI sources told TOI that as the final list of Indian women athletes who will qualify will be known only at the end of the qualifying period on Aug 24, the tests will be ongoing, starting with those who have already made the grade or who are on the verge of making the cut. “All athletes have been informed about the requirement and most of these samples will be tested at the National Dope Testing Laboratory (NDTL) in New Delhi,” they said. Asked if the samples would be sent abroad, the sources said NDTL is equipped to conduct the required tests. While Parul Chaudhary (3000m steeplechase) and Priyanka (35km race walk) have made the cut, Annu Rani (javelin throw) has more or less confirmed her berth through the world ranking quota. Another five athletes — Ankita (3000m steeplechase), Seema (10,000m), Shaili Singh (long jump), Vithya Ramraj (400m hurdles) and Pooja (high jump) — have kept their hopes alive and will look to give their best in the Inter-State meet beginning in Chennai on Aug 20. World Athletics announced the new test on July 30 and said the new regulations will come into effect on Sept 1, 2025 and will be applied to the Worlds that begin on Sept 13. “All athletes wishing to compete in the female category at the World Championships are required to undergo a once-in-a-lifetime test for the SRY gene — a reliable proxy for determining biological sex,” the world body had said.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Beyond the Olympics, victories in cricket, hockey, badminton, and chess have fueled national pride. Recent triumphs, such as Neeraj Chopra's athletic gold and the Paralympics success, continue to shape India's sporting legacy on the global stage. Kapil Dev, Neeraj Chopra and Manu Bhaker  From dusty playgrounds to the grandest arenas, India’s sporting story since 1947 has been built on sweat, spirit, and relentless dreams. In a nation where sport often carries the hopes of a billion, some victories have transcended scoreboards to become timeless moments of national pride.The Olympics have provided some of India’s most iconic breakthroughs.

Four years later, in Melbourne, the men’s hockey team defeated Pakistan to claim gold, the nation’s first Olympic hockey title since independence and their sixth in a row overall.In 1996, tennis star Leander Paes captured bronze in Atlanta, becoming the first Asian to win an Olympic tennis medal and the only Indian to do so. Sydney 2000 brought another historic moment as weightlifter Karnam Malleswari became the first Indian woman to win an Olympic medal with her bronze. Beijing 2008 was a watershed: shooter Abhinav Bindra clinched India’s first-ever individual Olympic gold, while wrestler Sushil Kumar took bronze before upgrading to silver in London 2012, making him the first Indian with two individual Olympic medals.Tokyo 2020 (held in 2021) delivered another golden chapter when javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra won India’s first-ever Olympic gold in athletics. At Paris 2024, shooter Manu Bhaker became the first Indian to win two medals at the same Olympics, further enriching the nation’s sporting legacy.Beyond the Olympics, Indian sport has had its own landmark triumphs. In 1951, the national football team won Asian Games gold in New Delhi. The following year, India secured its maiden Test cricket victory against England in Chennai. Men’s hockey reached another peak in 1975, winning their first and only World Cup in Kuala Lumpur.In 1980, badminton great Prakash Padukone claimed the prestigious All England Open title, inspiring generations.

Under MS Dhoni, India won the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2007, the ODI World Cup in 2011, and the Champions Trophy in 2013 — making him the only captain to hold all three ICC white-ball titles. In 2024, India won the T20 World Cup under Rohit Sharma, ending a trophy drought since 2013, and went on to win the 2025 Champions Trophy as well.Recent years have brought fresh glories. In 2019, PV Sindhu became the first Indian to win the Badminton World Championship. In 2022, the men’s badminton team won the Thomas Cup. In 2023, Neeraj Chopra struck gold at the World Athletics Championships in Budapest. And at the 2024 Paris Paralympics, India recorded its best-ever medal haul of 29, rewriting the nation’s Paralympic history.From the wrestling mat to the cricket pitch, from hockey turf to athletics track, these moments have shaped India’s sporting soul — each victory a reminder that the nation’s dreams, once forged in dust, now shine on the world’s brightest stages.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Something ‘big’ is moving inside Earth; here’s what scientists just foundTOI Science Desk / TIMESOFINDIA.COM /  Aug 15, 2025, 06:00 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLargeA groundbreaking study by ETH Zurich reveals that solid rock in Earth's D" layer, located deep within the mantle, can move like a fluid while remaining solid. Researchers used diamond anvil cells and X-ray diffraction to observe mineral behavior under extreme conditions, explaining seismic wave anomalies and linking deep mantle processes to plate tectonics, volcanism, and Earth's magnetic field. Something ‘big’ is moving inside Earth; here’s what scientists just found For decades, scientists have sought to unravel the mysteries hidden deep beneath Earth’s surface. One of the most puzzling regions has been the D" layer, located about 2,700 kilometres (1,700 miles) beneath the surface, at the boundary between the planet’s lower mantle and outer core. This zone has long been known for its unusual seismic properties, which have sparked debates about its composition and behaviour.Now, a groundbreaking study conducted by researchers at ETH Zurich has revealed that solid rock in this deep layer of Earth’s mantle can move like a fluid, while still maintaining its solid state. Led by Professor Motohiko Murakami, the research team has provided experimental evidence explaining how minerals in the D" layer align and deform over geological timescales. The findings, published in Communications Earth & Environment, shed new light on mantle convection, plate tectonics, volcanic activity, and even the generation of Earth’s magnetic field.Earth’s hidden D" layer finally comes into focusThe D" layer sits just above the outer core and plays a key role in the planet’s internal dynamics. It has been a focal point for geoscientists because seismic waves passing through it behave differently than expected, often travelling faster in some regions and slower in others. Understanding the cause of these variations has been a challenge, as conditions in this layer involve extreme pressures and temperatures that are difficult to replicate in laboratory experiments.To study the D" layer, Murakami’s team used diamond anvil cells—devices capable of generating pressures exceeding those found deep within Earth—and X-ray diffraction techniques to examine the atomic structure of minerals under such conditions.The researchers recreated the high-pressure, high-temperature environment of the D" layer and observed how minerals behaved. They used magnesium germanate crystals as an experimental analogue for mantle minerals because they exhibit similar structural properties but are easier to work with in the lab.Role of post-perovskite in mantle dynamicsThe study focused on post-perovskite, a high-pressure phase of the mineral perovskite that forms under the extreme conditions of the D" layer. Post-perovskite has unique structural properties that allow its crystals to align in specific patterns when subjected to geological stress over long periods.This alignment enables solid-state flow, a process in which solid rock deforms and moves like a viscous fluid without melting. Such movement plays a critical role in mantle convection—the slow circulation of rock that drives the movement of tectonic plates at Earth’s surface.Explaining seismic wave anomaliesOne of the major outcomes of the research is the explanation for why seismic waves can accelerate by up to seven percent when passing through certain regions of the D" layer. The alignment of post-perovskite crystals changes the way seismic energy travels through the rock, matching patterns observed in global seismological data.This discovery effectively resolves a long-standing puzzle in geophysics and provides a clear link between deep mantle mineral behaviour and surface-level seismic measurements.Impact on plate tectonics and volcanismThe movement of solid rock in the D" layer has significant implications for plate tectonics. Mantle plumes—columns of hot rock rising from deep within the Earth—can be guided by the alignment of post-perovskite minerals, directing heat and material toward the upper mantle and crust.These processes are responsible for creating volcanic hotspots such as those in Hawaii and Iceland. The study also helps explain how deep mantle processes influence the formation of mountain ranges and the activity along subduction zones where one tectonic plate slides beneath another.Connection to Earth’s magnetic fieldBeyond plate tectonics, the findings have important implications for understanding the geodynamo—the mechanism that generates Earth’s magnetic field. The distribution of heat from the deep mantle to the outer core affects convection within the liquid iron core, which in turn influences magnetic field generation.By showing how the D" layer channels heat through solid-state flow, the study reveals a previously underappreciated link between deep mantle processes and the stability and variations of Earth’s magnetic field over the past 200 million years.Methodology and experimental insightsMurakami’s team achieved their results by:Using diamond anvil cells to create pressures of hundreds of gigapascals, similar to those at the core-mantle boundary.Applying high-temperature lasers to simulate the intense heat found deep underground.Analysing the crystal structures with synchrotron X-ray diffraction to observe how minerals deform under such conditions.Studying magnesium germanate as a stand-in for mantle perovskite allows the researchers to observe mineral alignment and flow properties.Significance for Earth scienceThe discovery that solid rock can behave like a fluid deep within the Earth provides:A more complete model of mantle convection and its effects on surface geology.An explanation for seismic anomalies detected in the D" layer.New insights into the heat flow between Earth’s core and mantle.A better understanding of how mantle plumes form and influence volcanism.A link between deep Earth processes and magnetic field generation.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

These formations, linked to von Kármán vortices, exhibited an atypical darkness, tight spiral structure, and a sharp directional change. This rare event provides scientists with a unique opportunity to study small-island wind effects and their impact on atmospheric patterns.  NASA satellites have captured a rare and eerie sight: 10 swirling “dark voids” puncturing thick cloud cover above Heard Island, an isolated volcanic landmass in the southern Indian Ocean, around 900 miles (1,500 km) north of Antarctica. The black patches, each averaging 8 miles (13 km) wide, formed in May 2016 and appear as part of an unusual atmospheric pattern. While these formations are linked to von Karman vortices, swirling air currents formed when wind passes around a tall obstacle, scientists note their unusual darkness, tight spiral structure, and dramatic change in direction make this event exceptional.The 10 dark voids show isolation’s impact on rare weatherThe 10 massive dark voids, captured in May 2016, are a striking example of how Heard Island’s extreme environment fuels rare atmospheric phenomena. This uninhabited Australian territory lies in one of the most remote and storm-battered regions on Earth, within the “Furious Fifties,” where powerful westerly winds dominate. Towering above the island is Mawson Peak, a 9,000-foot (2,700-meter) active volcano that disrupts airflow and cloud formations. The combination of volcanic terrain, fierce winds, and the island’s isolation provides perfect conditions for unusual cloud patterns, but seeing them so distinctly in satellite imagery is extraordinarily rare.Von Karman vortices: Nature’s swirling wind patternsVon Karman vortices form when fast-moving winds encounter an obstacle, such as an island or mountain, disrupting airflow and creating alternating spinning eddies on either side. These patterns are named after physicist Theodore von Karman, who first described the phenomenon. While von Karman vortices are occasionally observed in other regions of the world, such as the Canary Islands or Guadalupe Island, they usually appear as long, wispy trails of clouds. The vortices over Heard Island were instead marked by dense, perfectly circular gaps in the clouds, making this event stand out from typical occurrences.Unusual shape and sharp bend make it uniqueMost von Karman vortex streams appear smooth and aligned, flowing in a consistent direction. In contrast, the May 2016 formation over Heard Island bent sharply by nearly 90 degrees midstream, an abrupt shift likely triggered by intense westerly winds exceeding 50 mph (80 km/h). Additionally, the presence of thick clouds meant that only the vortex cores were visible, creating the illusion of black voids in the sky. This combination of strong winds, sudden directional change, and isolated visibility of the vortex centers is rarely seen in satellite imagery. Such extraordinary formations provide scientists with valuable insights into extreme weather behavior in isolated regions.A rare chance to study small-island wind effectsBecause Mawson Peak is smaller than most peaks that generate von Karman vortices, such patterns in this location are uncommon. This event offered researchers a rare opportunity to analyze how atmospheric flows interact with smaller volcanic landmasses. Studying these effects can improve understanding of how wind patterns influence global weather systems, climate, and even the transport of airborne particles across oceans. The Heard Island vortices also highlight how relatively minor topographic features can cause significant disturbances in large-scale airflow under the right conditions.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

The feat comes just weeks after Shubhanshu Shukla became the first Indian to reach the International Space Station.Historic Moment: Shubhanshu Shukla Touches Down Earth With Spashdown Off U.S. Coast | Axiom-4The expedition was carried out in collaboration with France and involved two Indian aquanauts who completed separate deep dives in the French submersible Nautile earlier this month.PollWhich achievement do you think is more significant for India's scientific progress?Diving over 5,000 metres in the oceanReaching the International Space StationOn 5 August, Raju Ramesh, a scientist at the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), descended 4,025 metres. A record-setting 5,002-metre dive by retired Navy Commander Jatinder Pal Singh the next day followed this.Union Earth Sciences Minister Jitendra Singh said, "We have an Indian going into space and an Indian going into the deep ocean almost simultaneously." He called it part of India’s “double conquest” in underexplored frontiers, which he believes will contribute to the country’s economic growth.The minister added that PM Narendra Modi has shown a strong interest in the Deep Ocean Mission and blue economy.The Deep Ocean Mission, cleared by the Union Cabinet in 2021, covers crewed and uncrewed submersibles, deep-sea mining technology, biodiversity research and ocean-based energy projects. It aims to explore and utilise resources within India’s Exclusive Economic Zone and continental shelf.Matsya 6000M Ravichandran, Secretary in the ministry of Earth sciences, said the Deep Ocean Mission was carried out to gain firsthand experience before India tries the same with its own submersible, Matsya 6000. "One of the verticals of the DOM aims to develop technology to harness non-living ocean resources and a submersible which can carry humans to the deepest parts of the ocean for exploration," he said.The Matsya 6000, likely to be ready by December 2027, will carry three people to depths of 6,000 metres inside a titanium alloy sphere.

The photograph highlights vegetation health, water distribution, and land use, aiding scientists in monitoring environmental changes. This image underscores the delta's significance as a biodiversity hotspot and its vital role in environmental stability. Source: X NASA astronaut Don Pettit has shared a striking near-infrared image of the Ganga River delta on X (formerly Twitter), captured during his Expedition 73 mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Posted on social media, the image provides a rare, high-contrast perspective of the world’s largest river delta, showcasing the vast, fertile landscapes across eastern India and Bangladesh. The photograph highlights the power of space-based observation in understanding Earth’s geography and the delicate ecosystems that sustain millions of people in the region.NASA astronaut captures Ganga river delta: Near-infrared photography reveals hidden ecosystem featuresPettit captured the delta using near-infrared photography, a technique that highlights features invisible to the human eye. Healthy vegetation appears luminous, while rivers, marshes, and agricultural land stand out with remarkable clarity. Scientists use these images to monitor plant health, water distribution, and environmental changes over time. By revealing fine details of the landscape, near-infrared photography allows researchers to track the effects of climate change, urbanisation, and deforestation, providing crucial data to protect this vital ecosystem.Accompanying the image, Pettit described the region as “the largest river delta on Earth,” underscoring both its geographical significance and natural splendour. The photograph quickly drew admiration from scientists, nature lovers, and photography enthusiasts alike and was praised for blending technical precision with artistic expression.Beyond its scientific value, Pettit’s photograph has captured attention for its visual appeal. The glowing greenery, winding rivers, and patchwork of farmland create a composition that blends art and science seamlessly. Social media users and science communities alike have praised the image, noting both its technical precision and aesthetic beauty. Pettit’s work highlights how space photography can inspire curiosity and appreciation for Earth’s landscapes, offering a perspective rarely seen from the ground.The Ganga-Brahmaputra delta: Asia’s largest river delta and vital biodiversity hotspotThe Ganga or Ganges delta, also called the Bengal Delta or Sundarbans Delta, covers more than 100,000 square kilometres and flows into the Bay of Bengal. It is home to millions who depend on its rich soils for agriculture, and it contains the UNESCO-listed Sundarbans mangrove forest. This unique ecosystem provides a habitat for endangered species like the Bengal tiger and supports biodiversity through its dense forests and interwoven waterways. Seasonal flooding replenishes nutrients in the soil, creating highly productive farmland, but also poses challenges for communities living in the delta.The Ganga river delta: Vital ecosystem and environmental stabilityThe Ganga river delta is not only vital for human livelihoods but also plays a crucial role in environmental stability. Its wetlands act as natural buffers against floods, while mangroves prevent coastal erosion and storm damage. These tools also assist in assessing biodiversity, identifying areas of habitat loss, and planning sustainable conservation efforts to protect both wildlife and local communities. Satellite and aerial imagery help scientists monitor these ecosystems, track seasonal flooding, and study the impact of climate change. Pettit’s near-infrared photograph contributes to this research by providing a detailed view of vegetation and land use, complementing other scientific tools used to safeguard the delta’s delicate balance.NASA astronaut Don Pettit’s near-infrared images of the Ganga river delta provide a striking perspective on one of the world’s most vital and expansive ecosystems. Covering over 100,000 square kilometres, the delta sustains millions of people, supports rich biodiversity, and safeguards coastal regions from natural disasters. Pettit’s work combines scientific observation with artistic vision, emphasising the importance of monitoring waterways, vegetation, and ecological health from space. Such imagery not only showcases the beauty and fragility of our planet but also inspires greater environmental awareness, highlighting the urgent need for conservation and fostering a deeper global appreciation of Earth’s natural landscapes.Also Read: NASA and Google collaborating together to develop AI medical assistant to boost astronaut health on Moon and Mars missionsAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

He was aided by Tiffany Fowler and Shae Saur. The stolen rocks were valued at $21 million. Roberts claimed it was for love, but the FBI found he planned to sell them. Roberts and his accomplices were arrested. The heist damaged scientific research. Source: LADbible In one of the most audacious and bizarre crimes in NASA history, Thad Roberts, a 24-year-old intern, stole moon rocks valued at $21 million in 2002, driven by romance rather than greed. Alongside his girlfriend Tiffany Fowler and fellow intern Shae Saur, Roberts executed a meticulously planned burglary at Houston’s Johnson Space Center, using authentic NASA badges, rewired security cameras, and Neoprene suits to bypass alarms. Their theft of 17 pounds of lunar samples included historic moon rocks from Apollo missions 1969–1972. While Roberts claimed the act was “for love,” the FBI revealed he had attempted to sell the rocks secretly online. This extraordinary heist destroyed priceless scientific research, embarrassed NASA, and shocked the world, blending science, crime, and obsession in an unforgettable story.$21 million moon rock theft at Johnson Space Center shocks scientists worldwideOn a July night in 2002, Roberts, Fowler, and Saur infiltrated Building 31 at Johnson Space Center. Roberts and Fowler donned Neoprene bodysuits, which allowed them to bypass thermal alarms, while Saur acted as a lookout. Using a power saw, they cracked open a 601-pound safe containing moon rocks and meteorites, including samples from every Apollo mission, many of which were irreplaceable and scientifically invaluable. The stolen lunar samples were worth approximately $21 million and represented decades of scientific research, experimentation, and NASA missions. The planning and execution demonstrated not only audacity but also technical sophistication, showing how a combination of insider knowledge, meticulous preparation, and determination can circumvent the most secure facilities. Source: Live ScienceWho is Thad Roberts? From NASA Intern to mastermind behind the $21 million moon rock theftThad Roberts graduated from the University of Utah with a triple degree in physics, geology, and geophysics, making him highly qualified to work at NASA. He met Tiffany Fowler, a 22-year-old stem cell researcher, and the couple quickly became romantically involved. Roberts reportedly told Fowler he wanted to “give her the moon,” framing the theft as a grand romantic gesture. According to People.com , the FBI considered financial motives, Roberts maintained that the act symbolized devotion rather than profit.Moon rock theft ends with FBI arrests and millions in NASA lunar samples lostRoberts and Fowler’s motivation went beyond romance—they symbolically “had sex on the moon” by placing stolen lunar samples under a blanket during intimate moments. Roberts later stated, “No one had ever had sex on the moon before,” underscoring the bizarre, almost surreal nature of the crime. While Roberts claimed love was the driving factor, the FBI discovered he had negotiated with a Belgian buyer willing to pay up to $5,000 per gram, proving the theft had financial implications.The heist came to a dramatic end when Roberts and Fowler traveled to Orlando to meet the potential buyer, only to be apprehended by undercover FBI agents. Saur and Gordon McWhorter, who helped arrange the sale, were arrested shortly afterward. The investigation revealed that the theft had caused irreversible damage: the moon rocks were now “virtually useless to the scientific community,” and three decades of NASA research notes were destroyed as reported.Moon rock theft from NASA leads to jail, house arrest, and finesThad Roberts pleaded guilty to the theft of moon rocks and other NASA artifacts, serving over six years of an eight-year prison sentence before his release in 2008. Tiffany Fowler and Shae Saur received house arrest, community service, and were required to pay restitution to NASA. Gordon McWhorter was convicted at trial for his involvement in the theft and sentenced to six years in prison. The case highlighted serious security breaches and led to stricter controls on NASA’s valuable collections.Also Read | NASA and Google collaborating together to boost astronaut health on Moon and Mars missionsAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Bermuda Triangle ‘mystery’ solved? Scientist explains the real cause behind vanishings of ships and planes
The Bermuda Triangle's infamous reputation for unexplained disappearances is largely unfounded, according to scientist Karl Kruszelnicki and supported by NOAA and Lloyd's of London. The region's high traffic volume, combined with challenging environmental conditions like the Gulf Stream and frequent storms, accounts for the incidents. Human error and equipment failure also play significant roles, debunking myths of supernatural forces.

The region's high traffic volume, combined with challenging environmental conditions like the Gulf Stream and frequent storms, accounts for the incidents. Human error and equipment failure also play significant roles, debunking myths of supernatural forces. Image: Getty Images  For decades, the Bermuda Triangle, the stretch of ocean roughly bounded by Miami, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico, has been the subject of mystery, fear, and speculation. From tales of ships vanishing without a trace to aircraft disappearing mid-flight, the region has inspired theories about supernatural forces, alien abductions, and even time warps. But according to Australian scientist Karl Kruszelnicki, backed by research from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Lloyd’s of London, these myths do not hold up. Far from being a cursed zone, the Bermuda Triangle’s so-called mysteries can be explained by natural environmental conditions, human error, and statistical probability. The truth, Kruszelnicki emphasizes, is far less otherworldly and far more rooted in the realities of nature and navigation.Bermuda Triangle poses no greater risk than other oceansKruszelnicki, supported by NOAA and Lloyd’s of London, has long maintained that the Bermuda Triangle is no more dangerous than any other ocean region. Disappearances occur at roughly the same proportional rate as elsewhere in the world’s waters. As noted by Kruszelnicki, the higher number of incidents is largely due to the Triangle being one of the busiest shipping and flight corridors in the world, where heavy traffic naturally means more recorded accidents. Statistical data confirms that when the volume of vessels and aircraft is taken into account, the accident rate is completely ordinary. This directly challenges the very foundation of the Triangle’s mythical reputation.Environmental and navigational challenges of 'Bermuda Triangle'According to Kruszelnicki, the geography and weather patterns of the Bermuda Triangle create conditions that can challenge even experienced navigators. The Gulf Stream, a powerful ocean current, can cause sudden changes in weather, generate violent storms, and push vessels off course within minutes. The region is also prone to tropical storms, hurricanes, waterspouts, and rogue waves that can overwhelm ships and planes without warning. Numerous islands and coral reefs make for hazardous, shallow navigation routes, increasing the risk of grounding or collision. Kruszelnicki also points out that certain areas experience magnetic anomalies where compasses may point to true north instead of magnetic north, leading to potential navigation errors. Furthermore, unpredictable microbursts and rapidly forming squalls can make navigation extremely hazardous, even for experienced crews. Sudden changes in visibility and wind patterns have historically contributed to numerous near-miss incidents in the area. When all these factors combine, even a minor miscalculation can turn deadly.Human error and equipment failureAs Kruszelnicki explains, a significant number of accidents in the Bermuda Triangle can be traced to pilot or captain mistakes, faulty equipment, or outdated forecasting methods. These human and technical shortcomings often occur alongside the already challenging weather and navigational conditions of the region. In earlier decades, limited communication systems and slower emergency response times meant that vessels or aircraft in trouble had little chance of rescue. Even today, with advanced technology, mistakes and malfunctions can quickly escalate into disasters when compounded by sudden storms or rough seas. Kruszelnicki stresses that the human factor is often underestimated in popular explanations of the Triangle’s incidents.Origins of the myth of the Bermuda Triangle The term “Bermuda Triangle” was first coined in 1963 by writer Vincent Gaddis, who linked the region to a series of unexplained disappearances. His writings sparked public curiosity, but the myth gained massive momentum in 1974 when author Charles Berlitz published a bestselling book that embellished these stories with speculation about Atlantis, alien abductions, and other sensational claims. Kruszelnicki has often criticized such accounts for their lack of credible evidence and reliance on anecdotal storytelling. The entertainment value of the myth overshadowed scientific explanations, cementing its place in pop culture for generations despite the absence of verifiable proof.Famous anecdote – the Bruce Gernon storyIn 1970, pilot Bruce Gernon reported encountering a strange tunnel-like cloud while flying through the Bermuda Triangle. He claimed his instruments malfunctioned, and upon exiting the cloud, he experienced a time discrepancy of about 30 minutes. The story has been widely discussed in books, documentaries, and paranormal circles, with some suggesting it could be evidence of a time warp. Kruszelnicki, however, remains skeptical, noting that the account is anecdotal and lacks corroborating evidence. Many experts, including Kruszelnicki, believe it could be explained by meteorological phenomena such as unusual cloud formations or optical illusions.Scientific consensus over Bermuda TriangleThe conclusion from NOAA, the US Navy, and Lloyd’s of London — all echoed by Kruszelnicki — is clear: the Bermuda Triangle is not more hazardous than any other heavily traveled ocean region. The so-called mystery is a product of natural hazards, geographic challenges, human mistakes, and decades of exaggerated storytelling. Statistically, the accident rates are consistent with those in other busy maritime and aviation areas. While the legend of the Bermuda Triangle may continue to inspire curiosity and creativity, the evidence, as Kruszelnicki emphasizes, points to a reality grounded in science, not the supernatural. Ultimately, the Bermuda Triangle’s greatest power lies not in sinking ships, but in captivating imaginations. It is a reminder that mystery often thrives where facts are overlooked, and that reality can be just as fascinating as myth.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

This ancient water, isolated for millennia, provides unprecedented insights into Earth's early conditions and potential for life in extreme environments. Professor Barbara Sherwood Lollar's team's findings challenge existing assumptions and open new avenues for astrobiological research.  In 2016, scientists discovered the oldest water on Earth deep within a Canadian mine, estimated to be over 2 billion years old. This rare water had been trapped underground, isolated from surface influences, offering unique insights into Earth’s ancient geological past and extreme environments. Professor Barbara Sherwood Lollar and her team made this remarkable discovery in the Kidd Creek Mine in Ontario, Canada. The water's extraordinary age and composition have important implications for understanding subterranean ecosystems and the possibility of life in harsh conditions, including on other planets.This finding marks a groundbreaking moment in geology and astrobiology, revealing how Earth’s deepest waters can hold secrets from billions of years ago.Discovery of the oldest water on Earth in Kidd Creek MineThe oldest water on Earth was uncovered at a depth of about 3 kilometers in the Kidd Creek Mine, Ontario. This water had remained sealed away for roughly 1.5 to 2.6 billion years, surpassing previous finds of ancient water worldwide. The research team, led by geologist Barbara Sherwood Lollar, tested the water’s age using isotopic analysis, confirming its unprecedented age. The longevity and isolation of this water make it a living snapshot of early Earth conditions, preserved untouched for billions of years.This groundbreaking discovery and detailed scientific analysis were published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications in 2014, offering a comprehensive look at the water’s age, chemistry, and significance. The findings challenge previous assumptions about Earth’s hydrological cycles and open new questions about the movement and preservation of water in the planet’s deep crust.Scientific importance of the oldest water on earth discoveryFinding the oldest water on Earth has major scientific significance. It offers clues about how microbial life could survive in isolated environments for billions of years, far from sunlight. This challenges previous assumptions about life’s limits on Earth and extends hope for discovering life in similar extraterrestrial environments, such as Mars or icy moons like Europa. The high salinity and unique chemical composition of this ancient water also provide insight into geological processes that occurred billions of years ago. These findings expand our understanding of Earth’s deep biosphere and the resilience of life. Moreover, studying such ancient water helps scientists understand how life might adapt to extreme conditions, pushing the boundaries of astrobiology and earth sciences.Tasting the oldest water on earth: A geologist’s unique experienceIn a remarkable gesture, Professor Sherwood Lollar tasted the oldest water on Earth herself.

Woman astronomer paid 30 cents an hour: unlocked cosmic distances; still missed out on Nobel Prize
Henrietta Swan Leavitt worked as a Harvard “computer” earning just 30 cents an hour, yet her groundbreaking discovery of the period-luminosity relationship transformed astronomy. Her work enabled scientists to measure cosmic distances and understand the expanding universe. Despite this monumental contribution, Leavitt never received a Nobel Prize during her lifetime, highlighting the challenges faced by women in science.

Her work enabled scientists to measure cosmic distances and understand the expanding universe. Despite this monumental contribution, Leavitt never received a Nobel Prize during her lifetime, highlighting the challenges faced by women in science.  Henrietta Swan Leavitt, an American astronomer whose groundbreaking discovery revolutionized how we measure the cosmos. Born in 1868, Leavitt began working at the Harvard College Observatory at a time when women were excluded from operating telescopes and instead employed as “computers” to analyze astronomical data. Despite earning just 30 cents an hour, her dedication and meticulous research led to one of the most important astronomical breakthroughs of the 20th century.In 1908, Leavitt discovered the period-luminosity relationship of Cepheid variable stars, showing a direct link between their brightness and pulsation period. This discovery became the key to measuring vast cosmic distances and ultimately helped astronomers like Edwin Hubble prove that the universe is expanding. Yet, despite her monumental contributions, Leavitt was never awarded a Nobel Prize during her lifetime.The discovery that changed astronomy foreverLeavitt’s key insight came from studying Cepheid variable stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, a galaxy assumed to be at a uniform distance from Earth. By carefully analyzing photographic plates, she found that the brightness of these stars varied in a predictable way tied to their pulsation period: the longer the period, the brighter the star. This relationship, now known as Leavitt’s Law, gave astronomers a powerful “standard candle,” an object of known brightness that can be used to calculate distances in space.Using this standard candle method, astronomers could measure how far away these stars and by extension, the galaxies they reside in actually were. This was a breakthrough in cosmic distance measurement, allowing scientists to determine the scale of the universe with unprecedented accuracy. Leavitt’s discovery became the foundation for Edwin Hubble’s later work in the 1920s where he used Cepheid variables to prove that the Milky Way was just one of many galaxies and that the universe itself was expanding.Overcoming barriers as a woman in scienceHenrietta Swan Leavitt’s career unfolded during a time when women faced serious discrimination in science. Women were largely relegated to supportive roles and denied opportunities such as telescope operation and academic recognition. Leavitt was paid a modest wage of about 30 cents an hour as a “computer” at Harvard, tasked with analyzing star data rather than conducting independent research.Despite these limitations, she showed extraordinary focus and persistence. Leavitt’s progressive hearing loss later in life made her work even more challenging, yet she continued her observations and calculations until her untimely death at the age of 53. Tragically, although her work was foundational for modern astronomy, she never received the Nobel Prize or equivalent accolades during her lifetime, and a posthumous nomination was not permitted.Legacy and lasting impact on cosmologyLeavitt’s period-luminosity relationship remains one of the cornerstones of astrophysics. It revolutionized the way distances to faraway celestial objects are measured, enabling astronomers to map the universe on a grand scale. This method underpins modern cosmology, helping scientists determine not only distances but also the rate at which the universe is expanding, key to the Big Bang theory.Edwin Hubble famously used Leavitt’s discovery to measure the distances to galaxies beyond the Milky Way and uncover the expanding nature of the universe, a milestone that forever changed humanity’s understanding of our place in the cosmos. Today, Henrietta Swan Leavitt is celebrated as a pioneering figure in astronomy whose brilliance and perseverance overcame societal and physical obstacles, leaving a profound legacy that continues to guide scientific exploration.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

These magnetic nanobots address tooth sensitivity. CalBots seal dentinal tubules using a bioceramic formula. Tests on extracted teeth show promising results. Animal trials demonstrate complete behavioral recovery. The team sees this as a step towards advanced nanorobotics. This innovation offers lasting relief for millions. The CalBots are made from safe materials.  BENGALURU: For millions of people, the sudden, sharp pain of tooth sensitivity can turn a sip of cold water into a jolt. Now, researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), in collaboration with Bengaluru-based deep-tech startup Theranautilus, have engineered “CalBots” – magnetic nanobots that can seal the problem at its source.As per IISc, CalBots are 400-nanometre particles loaded with a calcium silicate-based bioceramic formula, designed to travel deep inside dentinal tubules, the tiny tunnels in the tooth that lead to nerve endings. Guided by an external magnetic field, the bots can penetrate up to 500 micrometres into the tubules and self-assemble into stable, cement-like plugs that recreate the tooth’s natural barrier. One application, the team says, can offer lasting relief.Dental hypersensitivity affects nearly one in four people worldwide and occurs when enamel erosion or gum recession exposes the dentine layer beneath, IISc said. The tubules in dentine act as direct pathways to the nerves, which is why even mild temperature changes can trigger pain. “We didn’t want to create a slightly better version of what’s already out there. We wanted a technology that solves a real problem in a way that no one’s attempted before,” Shanmukh Peddi, postdoctoral researcher at IISc’s Centre for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE) and co-founder of Theranautilus. The team used a completely new class of bioceramic cement for the nanobots. While bioceramics are common in orthopaedics and dentistry, the formulation was designed specifically for hypersensitivity – to travel deeper and last longer.To test the approach, they worked first on extracted human teeth. “On these samples, we applied CalBots under a magnetic field for 20 minutes, during which the bots sealed the dentinal tubules by forming deep, stable plugs – a result confirmed through high-resolution imaging,” Peddi said.They then moved to animal trials, inducing sensitivity in mice and tracking their drinking behaviour. “Healthy mice drank both cold and room temperature water equally. But sensitive mice completely avoided cold water. After treatment, they started drinking it again. We saw 100% behavioural recovery. That was a big moment for us,” he said.The CalBots are made entirely from materials classified as ‘Generally Recognised as Safe’ and passed toxicity tests in mice. “This is a compelling demonstration of what nanorobotics can achieve, and how they could significantly impact future healthcare,” said Ambarish Ghosh, professor at CeNSE and one of the study’s corresponding authors.Debayan Dasgupta, former PhD student at CeNSE and co-founder of Theranautilus, sees this as part of a bigger technological shift. “We’ve created a regenerative, active nanomaterial – a step towards the kind of ‘tiny mechanical surgeons’ Richard Feynman once envisioned,” he said.Peddi added: “This is something we’ve worked towards silently for years. And the fact that we’ve done it here, in India, makes us very happy.”About the AuthorChethan KumarChethan Kumar is a Senior Assistant Editor with the Times of India.

Though smaller than initially thought, it remains the largest interstellar visitor known. Confirmed as a comet with a glowing tail, 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be twice as old as our solar system, offering a glimpse into the early universe.  NASA has revealed exciting new information about a mysterious interstellar object called 3I/ATLAS, speeding through our solar system at extraordinary velocities. First detected on July 1, this visitor from beyond our star system has fascinated scientists globally with its astonishing speed of 130,000 miles per hour and intriguing characteristics. Recent observations from the Hubble Space Telescope have captured the clearest images to date, offering key insights into its size, makeup, and path. These discoveries represent a significant advancement in our understanding of these rare travelers crossing the galaxy into our cosmic neighborhood.NASA confirms 3I/ATLAS as the fastest interstellar object ever detectedNASA’s Hubble Space Telescope observations have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is travelling through our solar system at an extraordinary speed of 130,000 miles per hour (209,000 km/h), making it the fastest interstellar object ever recorded. This speed far exceeds that of previous interstellar visitors such as ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. Scientists explain that the object’s velocity is the result of billions of years of gravitational interactions, known as the “gravitational slingshot effect,” where passing stars, planets, and nebulae impart additional momentum to the comet. This extreme speed means the object is only briefly visible as it races through, providing a fleeting window of opportunity for study. NASA’s continuous monitoring aims to capture as much data as possible during its swift passage.Image: Daily MailSize estimates refined: NASA reveals 3I/ATLAS is smaller but still immenseInitial observations by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory suggested that 3I/ATLAS’s icy core might be around seven miles (11.2 km) wide. However, NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has now refined these estimates, revealing that the core is smaller — at most 3.5 miles (5.6 km) across, and possibly as little as 1,000 feet (320 meters) in diameter. Despite being smaller than first believed, this still makes 3I/ATLAS the largest interstellar object ever discovered, dwarfing the next largest known visitor by up to 14 times. The high-resolution images also highlight the comet’s glowing gas halo, which had made it appear larger in earlier, less detailed observations. Understanding the true size helps scientists model its composition and behavior as it interacts with solar radiation.NASA confirms 3I/ATLAS’s cometary nature and its spectacular glowing tailThanks to NASA’s powerful telescopes, scientists have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is not a solid rock but a comet — a chunk of ice, frozen gases, and dust surrounded by a halo of evaporating material. The Hubble images reveal a dust plume streaming from the side of the comet heated by the Sun, along with a faint tail trailing behind it. This tail is formed as the comet’s surface warms up, causing ice to vaporize and release gas and dust into space, creating the characteristic glowing appearance. This phenomenon is similar to that seen in comets within our solar system, but 3I/ATLAS’s interstellar origin and extreme speed make it a rare and valuable subject for study. NASA expects the tail and dust plume to become more pronounced as the object approaches its closest point to the Sun. Scientists hope continued observation will shed light on the comet’s chemical composition, helping reveal clues about its interstellar origins.Ancient traveler: NASA estimates 3I/ATLAS is twice as old as our solar systemOne of the most astonishing revelations from NASA’s studies is the estimated age of 3I/ATLAS. Scientific analysis suggests this object has been orbiting the Milky Way for at least eight billion years — roughly twice the age of our own 4.6 billion-year-old solar system. This implies 3I/ATLAS formed long before our Sun and planets came into existence, making it a true cosmic relic. Its journey through the galaxy has likely included multiple gravitational encounters with stars and interstellar clouds, which may have shaped its trajectory and speed. Studying such an ancient object offers scientists a unique glimpse into the conditions and materials present in the early universe and helps refine models of galactic evolution. Its fleeting passage is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to study a messenger from the galaxy’s distant past.Safe passage confirmed by NASA: No threat to EarthDespite its immense speed and close approach to the Sun, NASA has assured the public that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth. The comet will reach its closest point to the Sun in late October, passing just inside the orbit of Mars at about 130 million miles (210 million kilometers). Crucially, it will be on the opposite side of the Sun relative to Earth during this time, ensuring no risk of collision or gravitational disturbance. NASA continues to monitor the comet’s trajectory precisely, as the interaction with the Sun’s heat may slightly alter its path. After passing the Sun, 3I/ATLAS will head back out into interstellar space, continuing its long journey through the galaxy. This may be humanity’s only chance to witness this ancient traveler before it disappears forever into the cosmic void. Its fleeting visit serves as a reminder of the vast, mysterious, and ever-changing nature of our universe.A new era of discovery: NASA leads the charge in interstellar object research3I/ATLAS marks only the third confirmed interstellar object ever detected, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. NASA’s advancements in telescope technology, sky surveys, and space observatories like Hubble have ushered in a new era of interstellar discovery. Researchers expect that as survey instruments become more sensitive and comprehensive, the frequency of detecting such visitors will increase. NASA plans to utilize not only Hubble but also the James Webb Space Telescope, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory to study 3I/ATLAS in multiple wavelengths. This will allow scientists to capture unprecedented data on the object's composition and interaction with the solar environment. These coordinated observations are crucial for building a more complete picture of interstellar objects and their origins. This coordinated effort will deepen our understanding of the composition, origin, and behavior of interstellar objects and their role in the cosmic ecosystem.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

These massive structures, sculpted by ancient underwater avalanches, indicate the Atlantic Ocean connected earlier than previously thought. This discovery provides insights into Cretaceous climate shifts and tectonic movements, offering crucial data for modern geology and climate science.  Buried nearly a kilometre beneath the Atlantic seabed west of Guinea-Bissau lies a geological time-capsule: gigantic 117-million-year-old mud waves sculpted by dense, underwater avalanches. A new study published in Global and Planetary Change reveals that these ancient structures were formed when early Atlantic waters carved through the Earth’s crust, much earlier than previously believed. This discovery reshapes our understanding of Atlantic Ocean formation, offers fresh perspectives on Cretaceous climate shifts, and provides clues to tectonic movements that governed our planet’s evolving geography. From deep-sea sediment patterns to global carbon cycles, these mud waves, once hidden, now tell a story with far-reaching implications for modern geology and climate science.Underwater mud waves push the Atlantic's birth date back to 117 million years agoRecent research published in Global and Planetary Change (2025) by Duarte, Nicholson, and colleagues has shed new light on the early history of the Atlantic Ocean. Using a combination of modern seismic imaging and archived drilling data from 1975, the team identified a series of massive 117-million-year-old mud waves buried deep beneath the Atlantic seafloor. These geological giants, stretching over a kilometer in length and rising hundreds of meters high, were formed when dense, salty water from the young North Atlantic spilled into the deeper southern basins, creating powerful underwater currents. The composition and layering of these mud waves reveal that such flows occurred far earlier than previously believed, suggesting that the Equatorial Atlantic Gateway, the oceanic passage linking the northern and southern Atlantic opened sooner than most geological models predicted. This pushes back the estimated timeline of when the Atlantic became a fully connected ocean, making the discovery a crucial piece in reconstructing Earth’s plate tectonic and oceanographic history. Not only does this finding refine our understanding of how and when the Atlantic took shape, but it also offers insights into the role of deep-water currents in shaping the seafloor over millions of years.Sediment patterns illuminate early ocean currents and climate changeThe formation of these 117-million-year-old mud waves was far more than an isolated ocean-floor event, it represented a profound turning point in Earth’s climate and geological history. When the young North Atlantic’s saline waters finally breached into the long-isolated southern basins, they encountered dense, carbon-rich deep waters that had been locked away for millions of years. This sudden mixing unleashed colossal underwater mud avalanches, cascading across the seabed with immense force and reshaping the ocean floor’s topography on a scale rarely seen in Earth’s past.The consequences reached far beyond the geology. This tectonic–oceanic upheaval likely interrupted one of the planet’s most important climate-regulating processes: the long-term burial of carbon in marine sediments. By disturbing these ancient, carbon-heavy layers, the event may have kept vast amounts of greenhouse gases circulating in the atmosphere, helping sustain the elevated global temperatures characteristic of the mid-Cretaceous, a period often referred to as one of Earth’s “greenhouse worlds.” Such persistent warmth not only influenced ocean chemistry and circulation but also shaped the evolution and distribution of marine life for millions of years afterward.Understanding precisely when the Equatorial Atlantic Gateway opened is therefore critical. It marks the moment the Atlantic transitioned from a series of isolated basins into a fully connected ocean, altering heat and nutrient flows on a global scale. By reconstructing this event, scientists can better model ancient ocean currents, climate feedback loops, and the deep-time mechanisms that still echo in today’s climate system. In essence, these mud waves are not just relics of a vanished seafloor, they are a geological signature of the forces that have shaped, and continue to shape, Earth’s climate trajectory.Why this discovery matters: from paleoceanography to climate modellingKnowing that the Atlantic began to take shape around 117 million years ago, evidence preserved in those colossal buried mud waves, significantly sharpens scientists’ ability to model ancient ocean behaviour, tectonic shifts, and climate feedback loops. This revised timeline offers a clearer window into how early ocean gateways controlled the movement of heat across the planet, regulated carbon sequestration in marine sediments, and set the stage for long-term cooling or warming trends.By tracing these deep-time processes, researchers can better understand the intricate relationship between ocean circulation and Earth’s climate system. Crucially, such knowledge is not confined to the past, it provides a framework for anticipating the effects of today’s oceanic changes. From accelerating polar ice melt to shifting global currents, the same mechanisms that once shaped the Cretaceous world could, in altered form, dictate the trajectory of our future climate.Also read| Study reveals nature's hardest teeth: Chitons inspire future material designAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Although there is still no specific therapeutic medicine, a vaccine has been developed and approved for use in certain parts of the world, but no licensed or approved dengue vaccines are available in India, a high-incidence country.Led by Sweden’s Karolinska Institute, the project involves researchers from eight European universities, five Indian institutions, a university from the US, and an NGO from Guatemala, all working in the field of public healthcare and medical research.The total project cost is estimated to be around Rs 90 crore. The EU has already sanctioned Euro 8 million (nearly Rs 81 crore). The balance will be funded by the Govt of India through the Dept of Biotechnology, Ujjwal Neogi, the coordinator for the project, also a senior lecturer at Karolinska Institute, told TOI.The EU partners are collaborating with several leading institutes in India that include Artemis Hospital and Max Hospital in New Delhi, Kasturba Medical College Hospital in Mangalore, Regional Centre for Biotechnology, Faridabad. The India part is being led by National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani in West Bengal. “We’re bringing together the brightest minds from Europe and India to understand the disease at a molecular level and design better tools for diagnosis and prevention,” Neogi from Karolinska Institute said.Stockholm-based Karolinska Institute is a 215-year-old world-leading medical research university that every year selects the Nobel Prize winner in physiology or medicine.The project has a dual objective. Primarily, it aims at better understanding the complete lifecycle of dengue infection: From the origin of the virus, to how it spreads in human beings to how it affects the human body. And then to come out with solutions so that the spread of this mosquito-induced disease could be contained, its impacts on human beings could be predicted during the early onset of the disease, and could be cured more effectively and quickly than now.With an estimated 100 million infections annually across 144 countries leading to over 10,000 deaths, this predominantly tropical disease is now spreading in Europe, mainly due to climate change, the project’s website noted.Another equally important objective of the project is to better understand how, in general, virus-induced pandemics spread and to prepare a blueprint for countering such incidents in future. The secondary objective of the project grew in importance in the backdrop of the Covid-induced global pandemic, researchers working in the project told TOI.From India’s side, the partners will make “original research contributions to the overall objectives of the program, that is pioneering innovative antiviral strategies to alleviate the burden of dengue infection while deepening our understanding of its complex pathogenesis through cutting-edge multi-modal technologies,” said Arindam Maitra, Professor, National Institute of Biomedical Genomics. Maitra is the chief coordinator for the researchers in India involved in this project.“The Indian team will collect, clinically characterize, undertake viral and host multiomics investigations to identify key factors facilitating severe disease and undertake research to come up with antiviral and immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies (that can regulate body's immune response) in collaboration with the EU team.” The ‘multiomics investigations’ here refer to an integrated data analysis of various DNA and RNA molecules within a dengue-infected person to identify novel biomarkers and improve disease classification.According to Neogi, among various cutting-edge research techniques, the project will use the brain-on-chip process. This is a relatively new research technique that simulates a human brain’s functions under a controlled environment in a laboratory. The researchers would be using the brain-on-chip process to see what happens to a human brain when the dengue virus infects the body. They expect the same technique could also give them some idea about combating the virus that is spread through mosquitoes. The technology will be transferred to India from the EU partners.About the primary takeaways for India from this project, Maitra said that given the increasing occurrence of severe disease and death following dengue virus infection in India and other parts of the globe, “this research initiative is expected to provide information and solutions which have the potential to play a major role in combating this challenge.”About the AuthorPartha SinhaPartha, senior assistant editor (markets) at The Times of India, Mumbai, covers the financial markets, mainly the stock market, mutual funds, banking and insurance sectors.

CMO-DA has shown promising results in simulated medical cases, achieving high diagnostic accuracy. This technology aims to provide reliable healthcare guidance in the challenging environment of deep space, potentially transforming healthcare worldwide. Source: Google Cloud As human space missions venture farther into deep space, the challenge of maintaining crew health grows increasingly complex. Unlike current missions aboard the International Space Station (ISS), where astronauts rely heavily on constant communication with Earth-based medical teams, regular medication supplies, and the option to return within six months, future journeys to the Moon, Mars, and beyond demand greater medical self-sufficiency. NASA and Google have teamed up to develop a breakthrough solution: an AI-powered medical assistant designed to support astronauts autonomously during extended spaceflight.NASA calls for AI medical assistant to support astronauts on Moon and Mars missionsWith missions extending beyond low Earth orbit, astronauts will face significant hurdles in healthcare management. Presently, ISS crews benefit from:Continuous real-time communication with ground-based medical expertsRoutine delivery of medicines and medical suppliesEvacuation options within months if medical emergencies ariseHowever, for lunar and Mars expeditions, communication delays can stretch up to 20 minutes each way, resupply missions will be infrequent, and emergency returns could take months or years. This scenario creates a pressing need for onboard medical autonomy, enabling astronauts to diagnose and treat health issues without immediate Earth-based assistance.Source: NASANASA and Google collaboration: Developing the Crew Medical Officer Digital Assistant (CMO-DA)To meet these challenges, NASA has partnered with Google to create the Crew Medical Officer Digital Assistant (CMO-DA) — an AI-driven medical tool designed for autonomous use by astronauts. This digital assistant is intended to serve as a virtual healthcare provider in space, bridging the gap when a medical doctor is not present onboard and communication with Earth is limited or delayed.Key features of CMO-DA:Multimodal Interface: Allows interaction via speech, text, and image inputs to facilitate easy use in space conditions.Cloud-Based Infrastructure: Operates within Google Cloud’s Vertex AI environment, enabling continuous application development and AI model training.Collaborative AI Model Development: NASA maintains ownership of the app’s source code and contributes actively to refine AI models alongside Google’s technology and third-party integrations.NASA’s AI medical assistant achieves high accuracy in testing key medical scenariosCMO-DA has already undergone preliminary testing using three simulated medical cases: ankle injury, flank pain, and ear pain. A panel comprising two physicians and one astronaut assessed the assistant’s performance across four key areas:Initial patient assessmentMedical history takingClinical reasoning and diagnosisTreatment planningThe results were encouraging, with diagnostic accuracies recorded as:88% for ankle injury74% for flank pain80% for ear painThese outcomes indicate strong potential for the assistant to provide reliable autonomous medical support during space missions.NASA’s plan to enhance CMO-DA for advanced space healthcareNASA plans an incremental development approach to continuously improve the CMO-DA system. Upcoming updates will focus on:Integrating medical device data: Incorporating inputs from onboard diagnostic tools for richer information.Enhancing situational awareness: Adapting AI algorithms to account for spaceflight-specific factors such as microgravity’s effects on human physiology.Contextualized medical advice: Delivering treatment recommendations tailored to the unique environment and conditions of deep space.This will enable the assistant to offer more precise, relevant, and timely healthcare guidance in the isolated and challenging environment of space.How NASA’s AI medical assistant could transform healthcare worldwideWhile designed for space, the implications of this AI-powered medical assistant extend far beyond astronaut health. David Cruley, a Google Public Sector engineer involved in the project, noted that although regulatory approval plans for terrestrial use are not yet confirmed, success in space missions could catalyze the adoption of similar AI tools on Earth.Possible benefits on Earth include:Improved medical care in remote and underserved areasEnhanced diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision supportIncreased accessibility to healthcare expertise in environments lacking specialistsNASA and Google also envision that lessons learned from CMO-DA’s development will accelerate innovation in the broader field of AI-driven medicine, ultimately improving patient care worldwide.Also Read | 4.56-billion-year-old McDonough meteorite older than Earth crashes into Georgia home; stuns scientistsAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Swift has cultivated a loyal fanbase through immersive experiences and reclaimed ownership of her music, disrupting industry norms. Her relentless work ethic and strategic decisions have propelled her into a powerful figure, offering a blueprint for success in any field.  Behind the glittering lights and chart-topping hits lies a carefully crafted strategy that has propelled Taylor Swift into one of the most powerful figures in the global entertainment industry. A NASA engineer has cracked the code behind Taylor Swift’s meteoric rise to global superstardom, revealing insights that extend far beyond her music. Sinéad O’Sullivan, a Harvard Business School graduate and seasoned rocket scientist, spent years analyzing Swift’s career and business strategies.In her upcoming book Good Ideas and Power Moves, O’Sullivan says that Swift’s success isn’t just about catchy songs or lucky breaks. Instead, it is the result of deliberate, strategic moves that anyone can learn from. From building a loyal fanbase to rewriting industry rules, Swift has crafted a personal brand and empire that generates billions and reshapes markets, offering a blueprint for success in any field.Taylor Swift’s strategic empire-building beyond musicO’Sullivan’s research highlights that Swift’s genius lies in her ability to construct entire worlds, not just songs. Taylor Swift has expertly crafted an expansive fan universe known as the “Swiftverse,” which goes far beyond her music to create an immersive, interactive experience for her fans, affectionately called Swifties. This world includes elaborate storytelling, hidden Easter eggs in lyrics, themed visuals, and multi-platform social media engagement that encourages fans to connect deeply, not only with her art but also with each other.This fosters a strong sense of community and loyalty, transforming fans into passionate supporters who actively drive her brand’s growth. The massive success of her Eras Tour exemplifies this phenomenon, injecting an estimated $5 billion into the US economy through ticket sales, travel, accommodations, merchandise, and job creation, especially boosting sectors like tourism and retail during a crucial post-pandemic recovery phase.Taylor Swift’s control over music rights and relentless work ethicA cornerstone of Swift’s empire is her strategic decision to reclaim ownership of her early work by re-recording her first six albums as “Taylor’s Version.” This move disrupted conventional music industry norms after her masters were sold without her consent, allowing her to regain financial control and send a powerful message about artist empowerment and creative agency.Beyond this, Swift’s meteoric rise is fueled by her relentless work ethic, unwavering self-belief, and deliberate choices. Balancing intensive touring, continuous music production, and broad business ventures, she demonstrates that meaningful success comes from taking risks, learning from failures, and staying true to one’s vision. Her journey offers a blueprint for aspiring entrepreneurs and artists on the importance of resilience, persistence, and owning one’s path to success.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Scientists are studying this biological marvel to inspire the creation of super-durable materials. This research could revolutionize industries by enabling the development of advanced cutting tools, biomedical implants, and self-repairing structures, mimicking nature's ingenious design. Source: The University of Chicago You’d expect the hardest teeth in nature to belong to sharks, crocodiles, or some ancient dino. But surprisingly the title goes to a slow-moving, algae-scraping mollusc called the chiton. This groundbreaking new study published in Science reveals that chitons, marine molluscs you’ve probably never heard of, grow teeth that aren’t just hard, they're harder than stainless steel, zirconium oxide, and even human enamel. And here’s the real kicker: they do it at room temperature, using a precise, protein-controlled biological system.Scientists say this process could inspire the next generation of supermaterials used in cutting tools, surgical implants, dental prosthetics, and protective coatings , all with nanoscale precision. Let’s dive into the science behind nature’s hardest, most magnetic teeth. Curious? Let’s break down what the study found and why it's got scientists (and engineers) geeking out.What are chitons and why do their teeth matter?Chitons are small, ancient marine molluscs that cling to rocks and feed by scraping algae off surfaces using a ribbon-like tongue called a radula. The teeth on this radula are constantly worn down and regrown and they happen to be the hardest known biological material on Earth, even stronger than enamel or bone.Scientists have long been fascinated by the strength of chiton teeth, but this new study reveals why they're so strong and how their structure could influence materials science.The science behind chiton teeth: Built to crushThe researchers used high-resolution electron microscopy and spectrometry to analyse the nanostructure of chiton teeth. What they found was extraordinary:The teeth contain magnetite, an iron-based mineral, arranged in a tightly packed, nanoscale crystalline structure.These crystals are embedded in a soft organic matrix, which offers both rigidity and flexibility, a rare combination in natural materials.This combination makes the teeth not just hard but incredibly wear-resistant, ideal for scraping rock surfaces without damage.Why this study could change future materialsThe implications of this research stretch far beyond marine biology. Materials inspired by chiton teeth could be used to:Build durable coatings for cutting tools, drills, and other high-friction equipmentCreate longer-lasting materials for aerospace or biomedical applicationsDevelop self-repairing synthetic structures that mimic how chitons regrow teethThe study's lead author, Dr. Erika Easterling, explained that nature often holds the blueprints for advanced engineering: "By studying organisms like chitons, we can reverse-engineer solutions for some of our toughest material challenges."Now that the microstructure of chiton teeth is better understood, researchers are working on synthetic replication using nanomaterials. The goal is to reproduce this biological architecture in labs and eventually at scale, creating next-gen materials that combine hardness, flexibility, and self-renewal.Nature's toughest teeth may soon inspire industrial revolutions, proving once again that biology often beats the lab in innovation.Also read| These 15 science facts are so bizarre, you'll think we're lying (but we're not)About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

This gas giant, larger than Saturn but less massive, orbits a star only one-fifth the Sun's mass. The discovery suggests that large planets might be more common around small stars than previously believed. Source: Earth.com  Astronomers have discovered a giant planet named TOI-6894b orbiting a very small red dwarf star that has only one-fifth the mass of the Sun. Despite the star’s small size and low brightness, TOI-6894b is larger than Saturn but has only half its mass. This surprising discovery challenges previous ideas that such tiny stars cannot form or hold large gas planets. According to a study published in Nature Astronomy and reported by Earth.com, large planets may be more common around small stars than scientists once believed, opening new possibilities for understanding how planets form.Huge planet discovered orbiting one of the smallest red dwarf stars: TOI-6894BTOI-6894b was found using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Its host star, TOI-6894, is a cool red dwarf, much smaller and dimmer than our Sun. Despite this, TOI-6894b has a radius larger than Saturn but with only half its mass. This makes the star the smallest known to have such a large gas giant orbiting it. This discovery challenges the assumption that small stars cannot form or hold giant planets. TOI-6894b’s low density suggests an extremely puffy atmosphere, possibly influenced by stellar radiation or internal heat, requiring further observational studies.Challenging planet formation theories: How TOI-6894b formed around a tiny starTraditional planet formation theories, such as core accretion, suggest that low-mass stars have thin discs of gas and dust that are not enough to build large planets. Scientists believe TOI-6894b could have formed through a modified core accretion process or through gravitational instability, where parts of the disc collapse quickly under their own gravity. Neither explanation perfectly fits current data, highlighting the need for further research to understand how such a massive planet can form around a tiny star.James Webb Telescope to study TOI-6894b’s rare methane and ammonia atmosphereTOI-6894b orbits far enough from its star to have a relatively cool atmosphere, with an estimated temperature of 420 Kelvin (about 147 degrees Celsius). Its atmosphere is expected to be rich in methane, which is rare among exoplanets, and may contain ammonia as well. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will observe this planet soon, providing valuable data to better understand its atmosphere and formation. This could offer important clues about planet formation in environments very different from our own solar system.Implications for astronomy and the Milky WayThis discovery has big implications for astronomy. Since most stars in the Milky Way are small red dwarfs, finding a giant planet around one suggests that such planets may be more common than previously thought. The study involved researchers from the University of Warwick, University College London, and the University of Birmingham. TOI-6894b challenges existing models and will help scientists improve their understanding of planet formation and the diversity of planetary systems in our galaxy.Also read | Seven superclouds: Giant gas neighbors of our solar system discovered About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

This visual evidence provides an unprecedented opportunity to study seismic ruptures in real-time. The analysis of this footage could refine earthquake prediction models and enhance early-warning systems, potentially saving lives in the future. Representative AI Image For the first time in history, scientists have captured clear footage of the Earth’s surface physically splitting during a powerful earthquake. The dramatic event, recorded by high-speed cameras and ground sensors in a remote seismic hotspot, shows the crust tearing apart along a fault line in real time. This unprecedented visual evidence offers scientists an extraordinary opportunity to study the mechanics of seismic ruptures, potentially improving early-warning systems and our understanding of how earthquakes propagate. Experts are calling it a milestone moment in the field of geophysics.How the Earth split was capturedThe footage was obtained during a recent earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale. Researchers had positioned advanced recording equipment in the region after detecting increased seismic activity over the past few months. When the quake struck, cameras captured the ground shifting violently, creating a visible crack stretching hundreds of meters. Normally, such events occur too quickly and unpredictably to record in detail, making this a rare scientific achievement. Researchers hope this footage will also inspire the development of new, real-time monitoring technologies for earthquake-prone regions.Pulse-like rupture and curved slip - Analysis of Myanmar earthquake ruptureWhy this matters for earthquake scienceSeismologists explain that seeing the rupture unfold on camera allows them to analyze fault movement frame by frame. This can reveal the speed of the split, the energy released, and how the rupture propagated along the fault. The findings could refine earthquake prediction models and help urban planners design more resilient infrastructure in quake-prone areas. The footage may also provide crucial insights into how secondary faults activate during major earthquakes, improving our understanding of cascading seismic hazards.With precise rupture dynamics now observable, scientists believe they can enhance algorithms used in earthquake early-warning networks. By recognizing specific seismic signatures just before a rupture occurs, these systems might provide precious seconds or even minutes of warning, potentially saving lives. Additionally, researchers aim to integrate this real-world data into machine learning models to improve the accuracy of earthquake simulations. This innovative approach could revolutionize how scientists predict seismic impacts and inform emergency response strategies. Continued advancements in imaging technology and data analysis are crucial for unlocking deeper insights into earthquake behavior. Such groundbreaking observations could mark the beginning of a new era in seismology. It also serves as a powerful reminder of the immense forces shaping our planet beneath the surface.Next steps in the researchThe video will undergo detailed analysis by an international team of geologists and engineers. They plan to compare the footage with seismic data from the same event to build a more complete understanding of the quake. This collaborative effort will also involve sharing findings with global earthquake monitoring agencies to enhance worldwide preparedness. The team hopes that these insights will lead to improved building codes and disaster management protocols in vulnerable regions. In addition, the team intends to simulate the rupture in advanced earthquake laboratories to test how different soil types and fault conditions affect ground movement. Furthermore, they aim to develop predictive models that can be customized for different geographic regions, enhancing local risk assessments. This could help forecast how future quakes might impact specific regions. Results from this research could be published within the next year, offering new insights into one of Earth’s most powerful natural processes.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

While Yuri orbited Earth on the ISS, Ekaterina waited in Houston, bridging the distance through a live video link. This extraordinary event showcased love's ability to transcend boundaries, blending space exploration with personal connection and capturing global attention. Source: Russia Beyond On August 10, 2003, the International Space Station became the setting for one of the most extraordinary weddings ever recorded. Orbiting Earth at 28,000 km/h, Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko said “I do” to his American fiancée Ekaterina Dmitriev, who stood waiting 400 km below at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.This was no publicity stunt—it was a daring blend of love and spaceflight, navigating complex legal, technical, and cultural hurdles. In a moment that bridged two worlds—the boundless expanse of space and the intimacy of human connection—it proved that even in the most advanced realms of exploration, the heart still finds its own orbit.International Space Station becomes the world’s most unusual wedding venueThe ISS is a multi-national laboratory in low Earth orbit, a place where every minute is carefully scheduled for experiments, maintenance, and communications. Weddings were not part of its official mission objectives.Yet, on that August day, the station’s communication systems—designed for critical mission updates, data transfer, and crew coordination—were temporarily adapted to facilitate a marriage ceremony. At the time, the ISS was orbiting roughly 400 km above Earth, completing one orbit every 90 minutes. That meant that during the wedding, the station likely passed over multiple continents, giving “worldwide coverage” a very literal meaning.How Russian cosmonaut long-distance romance led to the first wedding in spaceYuri Malenchenko, already a veteran of multiple spaceflights, had spent much of his professional life training and working away from home. Ekaterina Dmitriev, a US-based space enthusiast of Russian descent, had met him years earlier through mutual acquaintances in the aerospace field.Their relationship was a lesson in long-distance endurance. Malenchenko often trained in Star City, Russia, while Dmitriev lived in the United States. They sustained their romance through phone calls, occasional visits, and a shared passion for space exploration. The couple initially planned a traditional wedding with 200 guests in attendance. But when Malenchenko’s mission aboard the ISS was unexpectedly extended, postponing the wedding by months or even years, they faced a choice—delay the marriage or find a way to bridge the gap.They chose the latter. After securing approval from Russian space authorities, they planned what became the first and only marriage ceremony conducted from space.Inside the International Space Station’s first-ever wedding ceremonyConducting a wedding between space and Earth involved complex coordination between Roscosmos (Russian space agency) and NASA. The ISS’s Ku-band communication system was used to transmit live video and audio between the spacecraft and mission control.Key elements of the ceremony:Visual connection: Dmitriev stood in a decorated room at NASA’s Houston facility, while Malenchenko appeared live on a monitor from the ISS.Dress code: Malenchenko wore his formal Russian space suit with a bow tie as a symbolic gesture. Dmitriev wore a traditional ivory wedding gown.Music in orbit: Astronaut Ed Lu, serving as Malenchenko’s best man, played the wedding march on a small keyboard aboard the ISS.Cultural touches: Dmitriev walked down the aisle to David Bowie’s “Space Oddity”, linking the ceremony to space pop culture.Symbolic gestures: The bride blew a kiss toward the camera, and the groom reciprocated from orbit.From orbit to Earth: The reunion after the first wedding in spaceEkaterina Dmitriev later told the New York Times that, “As Yuri was further away, he was closer to me because of the communication we have.” She called the orbital wedding a reflection of “mankind’s desire and need to go one step further.”Marriage became a symbol of human adaptability—proving that even in the most extreme environments, people find ways to preserve traditions and emotional bonds. It also captured the imagination of the public, blending romance, technology, and exploration in a single event. Following the ceremony, Malenchenko continued his ISS duties for several months. In October 2003, he returned to Earth, finally meeting his wife in person as her husband. Photographs of their reunion marked the end of one of the most remarkable long-distance weddings in history.Also Read | 4.56-billion-year-old McDonough meteorite older than Earth crashes into Georgia home; stuns scientistsAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

These structures, thousands of light-years across, are potential star birthplaces, possibly formed from the Milky Way's spiral arms. The discovery, enabled by advanced mapping, reveals a galactic framework influencing star formation and galactic evolution, opening new avenues for astronomical research. Source: ScienceNews In a stunning breakthrough, astronomers have discovered seven massive structures of gas known as superclouds just beyond our solar system. These immense clouds, stretching thousands of light-years across, are likely the birthplaces of stars and may have formed from material stripped from the spiral arms of the Milky Way. While two of them, including the well-known Radcliffe Wave, had been identified earlier, five are brand new discoveries. Lying nearly parallel to each other and undulating in wave-like patterns, these superclouds are our largest local neighbours in space and are rewriting what we know about interstellar structure and star formation.A hidden interstellar structure revealed by modern mappingThanks to advanced space mapping using data from the Gaia spacecraft, a team of astronomers led by Lilly Kormann from the University of Vienna has charted a detailed 3D map of interstellar dust and hydrogen within 50 million square light-years around the Sun. What they initially saw were patches of high-density dust, but a closer analysis revealed that many of these dense zones were linked together in long, coherent structures. By connecting the dots, the team identified seven vast superclouds, including the Radcliffe Wave and a previously known one called the Split, lying close to the solar system in an almost parallel arrangement.Colossal dimensions and massEach of the seven superclouds stretches between 3,000 and 8,000 light-years in length and holds gas weighing 800,000 to 3.5 million times the mass of the Sun. These massive forms are not only among the largest known local structures in our galaxy, but researchers believe they might be even larger than measured, as parts likely extend beyond the edges of the current dust map. Positioned along the Milky Way’s disc, these superclouds form a sort of galactic framework that may shape the way stars and star systems, including ours, are created and distributed across space.Star nurseries within the supercloudsWhat makes this discovery especially important is that most known stellar nurseries, regions where new stars are born, are located inside these superclouds, particularly along their central spines. This pattern strongly suggests that superclouds play a foundational role in star formation, acting as the “mothers” to smaller, denser gas clouds that collapse under gravity to form stars. Scientists now believe these superclouds represent an early stage in the hierarchy of star-making, offering insight into how vast structures break down into smaller ones, eventually producing stars, solar systems, and perhaps even planets like Earth.The mystery of the wavesMost of the superclouds show a distinct wave-like form, rising and falling in an undulating pattern above and below the flat disc of the Milky Way. Only one, the Split, remains relatively straight. The fact that so many of these gas clouds zigzag in unison suggests there’s a common physical mechanism shaping them, possibly linked to galactic gravity, spiral arm dynamics, or even external galactic forces. Even more intriguing is how their average densities remain strikingly similar, despite differences in the amount of material packed into each section. This hints at a larger, still-unknown system regulating their structure and behaviour.What this means for astronomyThis discovery marks a turning point in our understanding of the local interstellar medium, the cloud-like environment that surrounds our solar system. As astrophysicist Bruce Elmegreen put it, we are only now beginning to "see what is very local to us," after decades of struggling to separate nearby structures from distant background noise. The identification of these seven superclouds gives scientists a valuable new framework to study star formation, interstellar physics, and the evolution of our galaxy on a large scale. It also opens new questions about what other structures might still be hidden in the cosmic dust.Also read | New Hubble photo shows cotton candy-like nebula in a nearby dwarf galaxyAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

"From the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall to Cumbria and Northumberland, 63 different projects involving 78 partners have transformed landscapes and supported the recovery of 150 species, many of which were on the brink of national extinction, through research, captive breeding, habitat creation, and conservation translocations," the body said in a statement released Wednesday.More than 15,000 individual animals and plants were translocated to expand species territories under the projects, which ran from August 2023 to March 2025. Notable successes include the reintroduction of black grouse to the North Yorkshire Moors, northern England, and the return of the large marsh grasshopper to the Norfolk Broads in east England after an 85-year absence. Despite the achievements, the chair of Natural England Tony Juniper warned more needed to be done. "A rising number of nature recovery projects, both large and small, are making a huge difference up and down the country," he said in the press release."We know we can turn round species decline and improve ecosystems with the right targeted actions, the drive and the funding. But time is running out fast," he added.Juniper called for more projects, more volunteers and more investment, particularly from the private sector.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous10 creatures that can live inside volcanic zonesLifestyleYou’re probably a hater if you’re one of these zodiac signsastrologyHow to set up a planted aquarium at home and the types of fish to keep: 10-step guideLifestyle'Coolie': Rajinikanth to SoubinShahir'spay revealed!EntertainmentAlia Bhatt’s hairstylist warns against straightening damp hair: Know why we agree with himLifestyleZodiac signs who are known for their simplicityastrologyDO NOT ignore these warning signs of a heart attackLifestyleDipika Kakar’s top 10 gorgeous ethnic looks for festive seasontvJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than Wordstv Next123 Photostories  Janmashtami 2025: 5 savoury snacks perfect for fasting and feasting5 veggies to pair with Rajma (kidney beans) to boost its fiber contentThese foods can reduce the cooking time of meat5 last-minute weekend trips from Delhi you can plan right now!From Varsha to Divinesh: A look at the winners of Sa Re Ga Ma Pa TamilIndependence Day: Unveiling 10 rare pictures from India’s struggle for freedom7 foods to strictly avoid in monsoon seasonGuard deployed, protests erupt: National Guard steps up presence in Washington; 10 things to knowMovies that made us question everything we thought we knewSara Tendulkar’s protein drinks: How to make them and their benefits123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillVanessa BryantDwyane WadeKyrie lrvingNHL Trade RumorsRaj KundraWhy Roblox Get Banned in QatarMega Slowbro solo in Pokemon GOJohnny SomalisBrock Lesnar Net WorthTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteAir Arabia reports AED 415 million net profit in Q2 2025 despite regional disruptionsUAE heatwave alert: Temperatures to soar to 46°C in Dubai and Abu DhabiUAE: Etihad hits record 20.3 million passengers in 12 months for the first timeUkraine-Russia conflict: Zelenskyy arrives in London, meets UK PM Starmer ahead of Trump-Putin's Alaska summitWhat is David G.

KAOHSIUNG: Thousands of people sheltered and fishermen secured their boats across storm-battered southern Taiwan on Wednesday as Typhoon Podul intensified on its approach to the island.The typhoon is packing wind speeds of 155 kilometres (96 miles) per hour at its centre and "is strengthening", Central Weather Administration (CWA) forecaster Lin Ting-yi told AFP.Podul is on track to hit lightly populated Taitung County at around noon (0400 GMT) before sweeping across the island and into the Taiwan Strait."We are worried about this typhoon," Kaohsiung fisherman Huang Wei told AFP as he used more ropes to tie down his boat and checked on other vessels."We had already made general typhoon preparations yesterday, but this morning I woke up and saw news reports that the typhoon has intensified to be as strong as the last, (Typhoon) Krathon," Huang said."Last time, the two boats behind us weren't tied properly and hit my boat."Krathon slammed into Kaohsiung in October, with wind gusts of 162kph. Podul has gusts of 191kph, Lin said. More than 5,500 people have been evacuated from their homes ahead of Podul, disaster officials said Wednesday, as the typhoon threatens to pound central and southern regions that are still recovering from storms last month.Mountainous areas of Kaohsiung City and neighbouring Pingtung County, as well as Hualien and Taitung counties, could see torrential rain, the CWA said.All domestic flights across the island of 23 million people have been cancelled, along with dozens of international journeys.Many ferry services have been suspended and businesses and schools across the south closed.Typhoon Danas, which hit Taiwan in early July, killed two people and injured hundreds as the storm dumped more than 500mm (about 20 inches) of rain across the south over a weekend.That was followed by torrential rain from July 28 to August 4, with some areas recording more than Taiwan's rainfall of 2.1 metres for 2024.The week of bad weather left five people dead, three missing, and 78 injured, a disaster official said previously.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 expensive animal-shaped bags that’ll leave you almost shocked!Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?Maharashtra’s UNESCO World Heritage Sites and other iconic monuments for history loversRajinikanth completes 50 years in cinema: Lesser-known facts about the ‘Coolie’ star6 lizards that prove reptiles can be adorable123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

Representative image GENEVA: Talks on forging a landmark treaty to combat the scourge of plastic pollution were stumbling Saturday, with progress slow and countries wildly at odds on how far the proposed agreement should go.The negotiations, which opened on Tuesday, have four working days left to strike a legally-binding instrument that would tackle the growing problem choking the environment.In a blunt mid-way assessment, talks chair Luis Vayas Valdivieso warned the 184 countries negotiating at the United Nations that they had to get shifting to get a deal."Progress made has not been sufficient," Vayas told delegates."A real push to achieve our common goal is needed," the Ecuadoran diplomat said, adding that Thursday was not a just deadline but "a date by which we must deliver."Some articles still have unresolved issues and show little progress towards reaching a common understanding," Vayas lamented.The key fracture is between countries that want to focus on waste management and others who want a more ambitious treaty that also cuts production and eliminates use of the most toxic chemicals.And with the talks relying on finding consensus, it has become a game of brinkmanship.A diplomatic source told reporters that many informal meetings had been scrambled together for Sunday's day off to try and break the deadlock."If nothing changes, we won't get there," the source added.Battle of the bracketsCountries have reconvened in Geneva after the failure of the supposedly fifth and final round of negotiations in Busan, South Korea in 2024.After four days of talks, the draft text has ballooned from 22 to 35 pages -- with the number of brackets in the text going up near five-fold to almost 1,500 as countries insert a blizzard of conflicting wishes and ideas.The talks are mandated to look at the full life cycle of plastic, from production to pollution, but some countries are unhappy with such a wide scope.Kuwait spoke up for the so-called Like-Minded Group -- a nebulous cluster of mostly oil-producing nations which rejects production limits and wants to focus on treating waste."Let us agree on what we can agree. Consensus must be the basis of all our decisions," Kuwait insisted.Nudging in the same direction, Saudi Arabia, speaking for the Arab Group, said the responsible way ahead was to start considering what bits of the text "may not make it to the final outcome due to irreconcilable divergence".But given how little is truly agreed on, Uruguay warned that consensus "cannot be used as a justification to not achieve our objectives".Eirik Lindebjerg, global plastics adviser for the World Wide Fund for Nature, told AFP that the Like-Minded Group's proposal was "another attempt to make it a waste management agreement", and to stifle talks on reducing the amount of plastic in circulation.Path through the fogThe UN Environment Programme is hosting the talks and swiftly called a press conference after the stock-take session.UNEP executive director Inger Andersen said a deal was "really within our grasp, even though today it might not look so"."Despite the fog of negotiations I'm really encouraged," she told reporters, insisting: "There is a pathway to success."Vayas added: "We need to accelerate. We need a better rhythm in this and we need to also work in such a way that it will be clear that we will deliver by the end."Afterwards, Bjorn Beeler, executive director at IPEN, a global network aimed at limiting toxic chemicals, told AFP: "This whole process has not been able to take decisions and is still collecting ideas. We're sleepwalking towards a cliff and if we don't wake up, we're falling off."'Profits from poisoning'Plastic pollution is so ubiquitous that microplastics have been found on the highest mountain peaks, in the deepest ocean trench and scattered throughout almost every part of the human body.More than 400 million tonnes of plastic are produced globally each year, half of which is for single-use items.Plastic production is set to triple by 2060.Panama's negotiator Juan Monterrey Gomez took the floor to slam those countries wanting to stop the treaty from encompassing the entire life cycle of plastic.He said microplastics "are in our blood, in our lungs and in the first cry of a new-born child. Our bodies are living proof of a system that profits from poisoning us". "We cannot recycle our way out of this crisis."End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksGlobal Standard indexUS stocks todayIndia-US tariffIntel CEOMukesh AmbaniUS jobless dataRussia crude oilTop TrendingTyreek HillSelena GomezKim KardashianTaylor SwiftTravis KelceBill Belichicks GirlfriendNBA Trade RumorsDwyane WadesShannon SharpeMike VrabelTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteTyreek Hill, ex Keeta Vaccaro rush baby Capri to ER;

Climate heat extremes driving tropical bird decline: study
Tropical bird populations have plummeted not only due to deforestation but also extreme heat attributable to climate change, according to a study published on Monday in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.  Another study published in 2017 showed how some tropical hummingbirds are now forced to seek shade to regulate their temperature in extreme heat, cutting into the amount of time they can spend searching for life-sustaining nectar.

Another study published in 2017 showed how some tropical hummingbirds are now forced to seek shade to regulate their temperature in extreme heat, cutting into the amount of time they can spend searching for life-sustaining nectar.  Representative image PARIS: Tropical bird populations have plummeted not only due to deforestation but also extreme heat attributable to climate change, according to a study published on Monday in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. Intensifying temepratures caused a 25-38 percent reduction in tropical bird populations between 1950 and 2020, compared to a scenario without manmade global warming, scientists based in Europe and Australia reported. "The findings are pretty stark," lead author Maximilian Kotz, a researcher at the National Supercomputing Centre in Barcelona and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), told AFP.Bird populations in the tropics now face 30 days of heat extremes per year compared to three per year in the mid-20th century, he noted. "This has major consequences for how we think about biodiversity conservation," Kotz said by email. "Protecting pristine habitats is crucial, but without dealing with climate change it won't be enough for birds."Nearly half of all bird species are found in biodiversity-rich tropical regions. These often colourful animals perform essential services for ecosystems, such as dispersing plant seeds. Invasive species another threatBut birds living in these regions may already be "close to the limits" of their tolerance to high temperatures, which can cause heatstroke (hyperthermia) or dehydration. The overview study does not provide figures for individual species, but earlier literature is rich with examples of the devastating impact of rising temperatures.One documented the heat-related decline of birds in Panama, including the king quetzal, the red-crested quetzal, the two-coloured kingfisher and the aurora trogon. Another study published in 2017 showed how some tropical hummingbirds are now forced to seek shade to regulate their temperature in extreme heat, cutting into the amount of time they can spend searching for life-sustaining nectar. Extreme heat waves, which are becoming more frequent, represent a far greater threat than increases in average temperatures or rainfall, another result of human-induced climate change. Up to now, it has been assumed that the decline in bird populations worldwide was due mainly to other well-identified factors, especially habitat loss, pesticide use, hunting, and invasive species, especially snakes that snack on bird eggs and mosquitos carrying avian malaria. But the new findings "challenge the view that direct human pressures have so far been the dominant driver of impacts on bird populations compared to climate change in tropical regions," according to the authors. To reach this conclusion, they analysed observational data from more than 3,000 bird populations around the world and used statistical modelling to isolate the effects of extreme weather from other factors.The findings help complete the picture of tropical bird decline, noted Aimee Van Tatenhove, a post-doctoral fellow at Cornell University's Center for Avian Population Studies who was not involved in the study."Deforestation has an obvious impact -- trees are cut and habitat is destroyed," she told AFP. "We need long-term datasets like the authors used to understand how extreme temperatures impact avian populations.""This study is an important reminder that we need to continue examining different causes of population declines and apply those findings to conservation initiatives," she continued.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  From Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leavesTop 5 Getaways in North and South India to Work RemotelyFrom Cristiano Ronaldo’s million-dollar sparkler to Arjun Tendulkar’s intimate proposal: Celebrity engagements that created buzz in 2025Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 expensive animal-shaped bags that’ll leave you almost shocked!Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

Fourteen people lost their lives battling blazes last month in the western part of the country. Hundreds of people were evacuated on Friday in the northwest province of Canakkale, where the busy Dardanelles Strait was closed to maritime traffic due to two raging fires.

Representative image (Image: AP) LAGRASSE: A wildfire in southern France slowed overnight into Wednesday after injuring nine people and burning through 11,000 hectares of vegetation, local officials said. The blaze, which started on Tuesday afternoon, is still threatening several villages in the aude department, where 1,500 firefighters have been battling to extinguish it."The fire is advancing in an area where all the conditions are ripe for it to progress. We are monitoring the edges and the back of the fire to prevent flare-ups," said Lucie Roesch, secretary general of the qude prefecture.She said firefighters are expecting to receive aerial support at dawn, but warned "this fire will keep us busy for several days. It's a long-term operation".The fire's advance slowed overnight due to high humidity levels, she added.One person was seriously burned and another injured, the prefecture said, adding that seven firefighters were also hurt. Camping grounds and one village were partially evacuated, and several local roads have been closed."All of the Nation's resources are mobilised," French president Emmanuel Macron said on X, while calling on people to exercise "the utmost caution".The qude department has seen an increase in areas burnt in recent years, aggravated by low rainfall and the removal of vineyards, which used to help break the progression of fires.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous10 beautiful and low-maintenance fishes for home aquariumsLifestyleKelley Mack: A look into the actress's most popular worksEntertainmentMalvi Malhotra redefines chic in THESE picsEntertainmentVitamins in broccoli: A, C, K, and more in one powerful veggieLifestyleJenna Ortega’s Wednesday promo looks redefine gothic glamourEntertainmentMegha Chakraborty’s Bubbly Fashion GametvKajal Raghwani blends tradition with charm in every graceful ethnic momentEntertainmentReduce dementia risk: 10 lifestyle changes that can protect your brainLifestyleUnmissable entry looks of Bigg Boss Malayalam 7 contestantstvPeshwai nath to Nathuli: Trendy hoop naths that deserve a place in your vanity boxLifestyle Next123 Photostories  The secret of Lingaraj: A temple where two gods dwell as oneBeyond Gangtok: 5 hill stations in Sikkim that redefine peace and serenity5 Foods that can work like natural laxatives and fix constipationUntold stories from Jaya Prada’s life and legacy7 smart ways for couples to split financesExploring wild side of Goa: 5 wildlife sanctuaries that are a treat to the senses6 Surprising Animals That Don’t Have Bones in Their BodiesThe best exercises to get rid of cellulite5 saree colours Rekha wears on repeat!What happens when you eat 2 apples a day and 5 simple breakfast recipes to try123Hot PicksRBI MPC MeetPatna Double Decker BridgeSpiceJetRBI MPC MeetRussia OilUS China TradeNSDL IPO allotmentTop TrendingTrinity RodmanDe'Aaron FoxConnor BedardDennis RodmanRussell WilsonMitch MarnersKirby DachMatthew TkachukConnor McDavidAdam RuzickaTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteBird slams into plane nose: Cabin filled with smoke mid-air; panic on Paris-bound flight — watchBaby bonus: China offers subsidy to boost birth rate; why 'lie flat' gen isn't convinced‘Remains hopeful’: Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs’ lawyer seeks Trump’s pardon; Combs to remain jailed till sentencing'I am going to exert my powers': Prosecute minors as adults?

Pacific algae invade Algeria beaches, pushing humans and fish away
At a beach near Algiers, brown algae native to the Pacific Ocean cover the golden sand,  posing a threat to ecosystems native to the area and their stench repelling swimmers at the peak of summer. The alga originates from temperate waters around Japan and the Korean peninsula in the northwest Pacific Ocean.

AI image ALGIERS: At a beach near Algiers, brown algae native to the Pacific Ocean cover the golden sand, posing a threat to ecosystems native to the area and their stench repelling swimmers at the peak of summer.Following a recent government call to help clear beaches swarmed by the seaweed species known scientifically as Rugulopteryx okamurae, several volunteers and charities have stepped in."When it washes up, we can't swim," said Salim Hemmedi, a 43-year-old vacationer at a beach in Sidi Fredj, where volunteers raked up heaps of the plant."We hope the situation will improve so that we can enjoy ourselves... and that children can swim in peace."The alga originates from temperate waters around Japan and the Korean peninsula in the northwest Pacific Ocean.It was first spotted in Algeria in late 2023, according to Lamia Bahbah, a lecturer and researcher at the National School of Marine Sciences and Coastal Planning.And lately, some have noted that it has been increasingly washed ashore.Youcef Segni, a marine engineer and biologist, said the algae proliferated at a significantly higher rate than in 2023 and 2024."They invade the habitats of other algae in the seabed, which leads to the disappearance of some species," he said, adding that it can also displace some native fish.Fast reproductionIn France, Spain and Portugal, the Rugulopteryx okamurae species has also been observed.Earlier this year, Spanish football club Real Betis introduced kits repurposed from seaweed to raise awareness about the issue.A 2023 study by the Marine Drugs journal said the alga's invasive character led to "a replacement of the native biota and an occupancy rate that reached almost 100 per cent in some locations" in Portugal.In Algeria, the plant has been spotted in at least three of the country's 14 coastal provinces, including the capital where 16 beaches are affected, authorities said."Are the waters suitable for swimming? Yes," said Environment Minister Nadjiba Djilali during the cleanup campaign, adding there were no records of the plant causing allergies.Researcher Bahbah said stopping its proliferation was "unfortunately impossible at this stage".She said the plant reproduces at a high rate, both sexually and asexually.The species can reproduce through fragmentation, meaning new individual algae can develop from fragmented pieces of other Rugulopteryx okamurae algae.The algae spread mainly by clinging to the hulls of boats, and the Mediterranean's moderate temperature favours the seaweed's fast reproduction."We are going to fight it," said Fella Zaboudj, a state engineer in marine sciences, adding that researchers were monitoring its spread, development and evolution.Zaboudj said research was also underway to determine whether the algae could be repurposed as fertiliser.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksSibu SorenPatna Double Decker BridgeSpiceJetRBI MPC MeetRussia OilUS China TradeNSDL IPO allotmentTop TrendingTrinity RodmanDe'Aaron FoxConnor BedardDennis RodmanRussell WilsonMitch MarnersKirby DachMatthew TkachukConnor McDavidAdam RuzickaTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website'Will raise tariff substantially in 24 hours': Donald Trump fires fresh salvo;

Ireland's wind energy sector has long been touted as full of potential. AI image BANGOR: On Ireland's blustery western seaboard, researchers are gleefully flying giant kites, not for fun but in the hope of generating renewable electricity and sparking a "revolution" in wind energy."We use a kite to capture the wind and a generator at the bottom of it that captures the power," Padraic Doherty of Kitepower, the Dutch firm behind the venture, told AFP. At its test site in operation since September 2023 near the small town of Bangor Erris, the team transports the vast 60-square-metre (645,000-square-feet) kite from a hangar across the lunar-like bogland to a generator. The kite is then attached by a cable tether to the machine and acts like a "yo-yo or fishing reel", Doherty said."It gets cast out and flies up, the tether pulls it back in, over and over again, creating energy," he said, testing the kite's ropes and pulleys before a flight.The sparsely populated spot near the stormy Atlantic coast is the world's first designated airborne renewable energy test site. And although the idea is still small in scale, it could yet prove to be a mighty plan as Ireland seeks to cut its reliance on fossil fuels such as oil and gas."We are witnessing a revolution in wind energy," said Andrei Luca, operations head at Kitepower, a zero-emissions energy solutions spin-off from the Delft University of Technology."It took nearly 25 years for wind turbines to evolve from 30-kilowatt prototypes to megawatt scale, and decades to offshore wind farms we see today," he added.The system flies autonomously, driven by software developed at the university in the Netherlands, but Doherty acts as the kite's "pilot" on the ground, monitoring its flight path for efficiency. The kite flies up around 400 metres (1,300 feet) and reels in to about 190 metres, generating around 30 kilowatts for storage.The force spins "like a dynamo on a bike", Doherty said, adding that "it generates up to two and a half tonnes of force through each turn".The electricity is stored in batteries, similar to solar photovoltaic systems, with the kite currently able to fully charge a 336-kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery."That's a meaningful amount of energy, sufficient for powering a remote outpost, a small island, polar station, or even a construction site," Luca said."Add additional kites and we can power a bigger island."'Mobile, flexible'According to Doherty, a chief advantage of the kite system is its flexibility and swift start-up capability."We can set up in 24 hours and can bring it anywhere, it's super mobile, and doesn't need expensive, time- and energy-consuming turbine foundations to be built," he said. A kite system is "way less invasive on the landscape (than wind turbines), produces clean energy and doesn't need a supply chain of fuel to keep running", Luca added.During January's Storm Eowyn, which caused widespread and long-lasting power outages in Ireland, the system showed its value in Bangor Erris, according to Luca. "Paired with a battery, it provided uninterrupted electricity before, during and after the storm," he said. Ireland's wind energy sector has long been touted as full of potential.But progress on large-scale delivery of onshore and offshore turbines has been held up by planning delays and electricity grid capacity constraints.The Irish government has set ambitious targets for offshore wind energy to deliver 20 gigawatts of energy by 2040 and at least 37 gigawatts by 2050.In 2024, Irish wind farms provided around a third of the country's electricity according to Wind Energy Ireland (WEI), a lobby group for the sector. This compares to the UK, where, according to trade association RenewableUK, wind energy from the country's combined wind farms first reached 20 gigawatts in November 2022.The ability of airborne wind energy (AWE) systems to harness high-altitude winds with relatively low infrastructure requirements "makes them particularly suitable for remote, offshore or mobile applications," Mahdi Salari, an AWE researcher at University College Cork, told AFP.But he said Kitepower would face challenges on "regulation, safety, and system reliability". Such technology however could plug gaps in places where "land availability, costs or logistical constraints hinder the deployment of traditional wind turbines", Salari said.By the 2030s, he said: "I expect AWE to contribute meaningfully to diversified, flexible and distributed renewable energy networks".Discover stories of India’s leading eco-innovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksSibu SorenPatna Double Decker BridgeSpiceJetGold Price PredectionRussia OilUS China TradeNSDL IPO allotmentTop TrendingRussell WilsonHailee SteinfeldsF1 StandingsDez BryantLebron James WifeRussia Oil ImportsTriple HPrince HarryRJ MahvashAntonio BrownTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteBrooke Hogan’s husband: Hulk Hogan showed no interest in meeting grandkidsDak Prescott builds new mansion, reveals why he razed the last oneTaylor Swift’s Kelce jacket inspires Kristin Juszczyk’s new NFL lineGabrielle Union on menopause: 'It makes it hard' — motherhood now more emotional, exhaustingGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai to employees: ‘I think we have to....'Apple CEO Tim Cook confirms: Majority of new iPhones sold in the US are 'made' in India;

(Ai generated image)  If you have a pet you can no longer keep, one zoo in Denmark is offering an unusual option.Aalborg Zoo is asking the public to donate small pets — not for rehoming, but to be used as food for its captive predators.Aalborg Zoo, located in northern Denmark, said in a Facebook post that the move is meant to mimic the natural food chain of animals housed there. The zoo says this effort supports “animal welfare and professional integrity,” and assures that any donated pets will be “gently euthanized” by trained staff.“If you have a healthy animal that needs to be given away for various reasons, feel free to donate it to us,” the post said.The zoo lists rabbits, guinea pigs, horses and chickens as examples of suitable donations.PollWhat do you think about Aalborg Zoo's practice of accepting pets for food for predators?Support it for animal welfareOppose it, find other solutionsOnce euthanised, the animals will be used as fodder for the zoo’s carnivores.“That way, nothing goes to waste — and we ensure natural behaviour, nutrition and well-being of our predators,” the zoo claimed.The post is accompanied by a picture of a wildcat showing its teeth with its mouth wide open. It also includes a link to the zoo’s website.About the zoo Aalborg Zoo was founded in April 1935. The facility is located near the centre of Aalborg and spans 8 hectares. It houses more than 1,500 animals across 126 species and draws hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.According to the zoo’s official website, Aalborg Zoo focuses on conservation, sustainability and education.It takes part in international breeding programmes for endangered species and supports global efforts in animal conservation, research and fair trade. It was also the first zoo in Denmark to receive an environment certificate and is known for its work in protecting nature and the environment.The zoo maintains that the practice of using donated pets as prey aligns with its mission to support natural behaviours in captive predators.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Pedestrians were seen wading through flooded roads with extreme caution, fearing open manholes, uncovered drains, and the threat of electric shocks from submerged wires and poles.PollWhat do you think is the biggest issue causing urban flooding during monsoon?Poor drainage systemsLack of planning and maintenanceMeanwhile, the India Meteorological Department has predicted heavy rainfall in the region over the next few days.Moreover, contaminated water triggered a diarrhea outbreak in Bihar's Jehanabad.

House razings to save Niger capital's forest shield dismay locals
Hamissou Issiakou grumbled as he worked to strip bare his house, marked for demolition for illegally encroaching on the tip of green forest that's keeping the expanding desert at bay from Niger's capital. Director General of Water and Forests within the environment ministry Yacouba Seybou said on state television that since 2004 "decrees have prohibited housing in the (green) belt".

Director General of Water and Forests within the environment ministry Yacouba Seybou said on state television that since 2004 "decrees have prohibited housing in the (green) belt". Representative image (AFP) NIAMEY: Hamissou Issiakou grumbled as he worked to strip bare his house, marked for demolition for illegally encroaching on the tip of green forest that's keeping the expanding desert at bay from Niger's capital.His is one of nearly 500 homes being bulldozed as the authorities in the arid desert country, which is particularly at risk from man-made global warming, seek to shore up the wooded belt around Niamey's outskirts.Ukraine Launches MASSIVE Drone Attack On Russia; 3 Killed, Over 100 UAVs Shot Down"We've bought our plots of land at great expense. In the end it's a big waste," Issiakou told AFP, after urging workers to hurry up and remove an enormous gate before the police arrive. Since the heavy machinery began rolling in at the end of June, dozens of slums, luxury houses and apartment blocks have tumbled like a house of cards.Some homeowners have just stood by and watched in dismay as the bulldozers tore down their houses. Others, like Issiakou, have rushed to remove anything of value before the two-week notice period was up, from windows, metal sheets and electrical cables to small drinking water tanks and surveillance cameras.All say they bought their land from private real-estate agencies. - 'Submit to Allah' -In a country with one of the highest population growth rates in the world, the number of residents in Niamey has doubled since 2005, from 750,000 to one-and-a-half million, according to the national statistics institute. Thanks to that rapid urbanisation, the forest belt has lost more than half its area since it was completed in 1993 and now measures just 25 kilometres (16 miles) long and a kilometre wide. Hailing from various social classes, the woods' soon-to-be-gone inhabitants were originally attracted to the capital's outskirts by the good quality of life and reasonable cost of a plot. The distance from the bureaucracy within Niamey proper, which can often delay construction projects by years, did not hurt either. Thermos in hand, Aboul-Razak Moussa handed out coffee to the workmen using crowbars to dig up the cobblestones in the courtyard of his brand-new building."I bought the land for 12 million CFA francs ($21,000) and invested 127 million CFA francs (more than $220,000) to build my building," the owner of a welding company lamented."We submit ourselves to Allah." Businessman Ali Hamza was indignant."We're in the peak of the rainy season, it's inhuman," the father-of-10 argued. So far, at least 4,000 people have been evicted and nearly 500 homes, mostly slums, demolished, authorities say.- Rising temperatures -Carparks, petrol stations, pharmacies, shops, rubbish dumps and health centres sprung up to cater for those who made their home in the forested area.The project to introduce a green belt around Niamey is not part of the African Union's flagship Great Green Wall initiative, but its aims are the same.Landlocked Niger lies in the heart of the Sahel, a semiarid region stretching from Senegal to Sudan where temperatures are rising 1.5 times faster than the global average.At the same time, Niger suffers periods of drought and severe flooding.It is "imperative" that Niger "preserves more green spaces", Sani Ayouba, head of the Young Volunteers for the Environment NGO said.Director General of Water and Forests within the environment ministry Yacouba Seybou said on state television that since 2004 "decrees have prohibited housing in the (green) belt".Under the law, offenders face three months to two years in prison.Former ministers have "authorised private housing developments", Boubacar Maman, an official at the urban planning ministry, said.The environment ministry says a zoo and aquatic park as well as a botanic garden, sports and leisure area will soon be created within the forested green belt.bh/bam/bdi/sbk-kjm/yadEnd of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousTransform your boring sandals with trendy DIY embellishmentsLifestyleBhagyashri Borse's style statementsEntertainmentFrom Pulitzer to Orange: 10 prestigious awards given for LiteratureLifestyle10 veggies that can grow in containers in balconyLifestyle'Kingom' actor Vijay Deverakonda’s stylish looksEntertainmentVijay Deverakonda’s fitness workout routineEntertainmentTop 10 colour-changing birds of IndiaLifestyleRaksha Bandhan-worthy mehendi designs to try this yearLifestyle10 things to know before getting an Arowana fish for good luckLifestyleMouni Roy’s top 10 gorgeous ethnic lookstv Next123 Photostories  Top 6 zoos to visit across India for a complete wildlife experience10 minute daily habits that are perfect brain exercisesBigg Boss Malayalam 7 Contestant Aryan Kathuria: All about the handsome actor featured in a Poonam Pandey show6 healthy smart foods for babies when their teeth hurtFrom white themed rooms to aesthetic details: Debinna Bonnerjee’s living and bedroom give peaceful vibesHow to spend 5 days in Madhya Pradesh: The perfect Orchha–Khajuraho itineraryRisk of type 1 diabetes may depend on where childhood is spentBigg Boss Malayalam 7 contestant Abhisree: All about the actor-dancer with an inspiring journey5 filling foods under 50 calories7 key boundaries mentally strong people set to thrive at work123Hot PicksKamala HarrisIndian NavyJ&K landslideTrump TariffsUPI New RulesGST collectionsJulia HymanTop TrendingWWE Summerslam HighlightsHailee SteinfeldsTop Richest Billionaries in the worldEarthquake VideoLebron James WifeRJ MahvashGerman Influencer BengaluruKannada signboard ruleNayara EnergyIndia US Crude OilTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire Website'Disgraceful': Ex-South Korea president Yoon Suk Yeol resists questioning by laying down in underwear;

Turkish city calls for help after heat tops 50 degree celsius
Southeastern Turkey is reeling under a record-breaking heatwave, with temperatures exceeding 50C in Silopi. Residents are struggling with soaring electricity bills due to constant air conditioning use and are appealing for state support. Deforestation and policy changes allowing mining on agricultural lands exacerbate the heat, intensifying the challenges faced by locals who depend on air conditioning as a necessity.

Residents are struggling with soaring electricity bills due to constant air conditioning use and are appealing for state support. Deforestation and policy changes allowing mining on agricultural lands exacerbate the heat, intensifying the challenges faced by locals who depend on air conditioning as a necessity. Representative Image  A choking heatwave left astonished locals in southeastern Turkey calling for state help to pay their air conditioning bills after the temperature surged past 50 degree celsius."We cannot cope with the heat," ice-cream maker Recep Esiyok, 59, told AFP in Silopi, where meteorologists measured 50.5C on Friday -- a national record."I've been living in Silopi for about 30 years. I've never seen such heat... I've never seen such heat anywhere."He is getting through the heatwave thanks to the air conditioner in his shop, but is now worried about paying for the electricity."My bill last month was 59,000 lira (1,450 dollars). We are asking for state support on this issue."'Incomparable' heat: Before Friday's record, the previous peak in Turkey had been 49.5 degree celsius in August 2023.Scientists agree that climate change caused by humans burning fossil fuels is increasing the likelihood, length and intensity of heatwaves."The heat has reached a point where it's incomparable to previous years," said Halil Coskun, 52, a local reporter.The country is still in the grip of the heatwave and since Sunday temperatures overall have surged from six to 12 degrees above seasonal norms, according to the state meteorology directorate.Wildfire threat: Turkey has fought fires in several regions since the start of the summer. Last week, 10 people perished while fighting a fire in Eskisehir province.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday the country has experienced drier conditions than normal over the past five years as a result of global warming."Extreme heat, low humidity, and strong winds are unfortunately increasing the risk of fire," he said.He said the state was using drones to monitor and protect forests.The streets were relatively empty and the atmosphere tense in Silopi, a Kurdish city whose main income is trade with Iraq across the border 10 kilometres (six miles) away."When it's hot, there's no one outside during the day," said Esiyok.Deforestation complaints: Other locals complained at the lack of vegetation to provide relief around the town, which lies at the foot of a mountain."Unfortunately, the forests here were burned in the past for security reasons," said Coskun.He said the Turkish army cleared them in the search for fighters from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a rebel group that recently disarmed.Turkey's parliament this month also passed a bill that opens certain agricultural lands including olive groves to mining activities, despite widespread opposition."We could at least minimise the heat by planting trees, not by felling them," Coskun said.Electricity bills: Sweating in his kebab shop, another local, Cemil Seher, said that summers in Silopi last not three months, but five.For Seher, 51, air conditioning is no longer a luxury but a necessity."AC is essential here as much as bread and water," he said."When the air conditioners are running, the electricity bills are very high," he said, demanding authorities offer discounts for businesses."I want a discount not only for Silopi but for the entire region from here to Sanliurfa" in the east, he said."I am not making a profit because I've been working... to pay my electricity bill."Discover stories of India’s leading eco-innovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksKamala HarrisBogota AirportUS Oil ReserveTrump TariffsUPI New RulesStarlink SatelliteJulia HymanTop TrendingTravis KelceTom BradyBengaluru Boy Kidnap MurderCBSE Class 10th Sample PapersHow new nep rule worksYuzvendra Chahal DatingStephen CurryJoe BurrowBlake LivelyTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website40 jobs AI can't touch in 2025, says Microsoft Research: Is your career on the list?Former PM HD Devegowda's grandson Prajwal Revanna convicted for raping 47-year-old domestic helpIND vs ENG Live: Rain likely to play spoilsport as India eye 300; Woakes ruled outUPI new rules 2025: New NPCI changes kick in from August 1 - All you need to knowSSC exam 2025 glitches spark massive nationwide protest: Here’s why #SSCMisManagement is trending on social mediaCAT 2025 registration begins at iimcat.ac.in: Check direct link to apply online hereAP Police Constable final result 2025 released at slprb.ap.gov.in; check direct link hereIs Yuzvendra Chahal dating RJ Mahvash?

Chinese sub discovers deepest-ever creatures 10 km undersea
A Chinese submersible has discovered thousands of worms and molluscs nearly 10 kilometres (six miles) below sea level in the Mariana Trench, the deepest colony of creatures ever observed, a study revealed on Wednesday. Last year, the Chinese submersible "Fendouzhe" -- or "Striver" -- dove 23 times into the depths of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean with researchers on board, according to the study in the journal Nature.

Last year, the Chinese submersible "Fendouzhe" -- or "Striver" -- dove 23 times into the depths of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean with researchers on board, according to the study in the journal Nature. AP file photo PARIS: A Chinese submersible has discovered thousands of worms and molluscs nearly 10 kilometres (six miles) below sea level in the Mariana Trench, the deepest colony of creatures ever observed, a study revealed on Wednesday.The discovery in Earth's deepest underwater valley suggests that there could be much more life thriving in the hostile conditions at the bottom of our planet's largely unexplored oceans than previously thought, the China-led team of scientists said.Almost all life on Earth is supported by light from the Sun. However, in the total darkness at the bottom of the world, these creatures live off of chemicals such as methane seeping through cracks in the seafloor, a process called chemosynthesis.Last year, the Chinese submersible "Fendouzhe", or "Striver", dove 23 times into the depths of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean with researchers on board, according to the study in the journal Nature.They found colonies of thousands of marine tubeworms and molluscs called bivalves at depths ranging from 2,500 to 9,533 metres (8,200 to 31,000 feet) deep. Video released alongside the study showed fields of tubeworms, which grew up to 30 centimetres (12 inches) long, as well as piles of molluscs and clams. Spiky crustaceans, free-floating marine worms, sea cucumbers, feathery-armed sea lilies and other invertebrates were also recorded in the depths.The study marked "the discovery of the deepest and the most extensive chemosynthesis-based communities known to exist on Earth," its authors said.Given that other ocean trenches are similar, "such chemosynthesis-based communities might be more widespread than previously anticipated," they added.The researchers said they also found "compelling evidence" that methane was being produced by microbes, with the tubeworms tending to cluster around microbial mats that resemble snow. Previous studies have found thriving communities of single-cell organisms on the ocean floor, but few large animals.But a remotely operated vehicle discovered tubeworms and other marine invertebrates living in hydrothermal vents in the crust below the seafloor two kilometres deep in the Pacific, research said last year.Pressure rising The new study was published as nations wrangle over the contentious issue of deep-sea mining. China, the United States and others have expressed interest in mining the depths for valuable minerals.Ocean scientists warn that mining the little-explored seafloor, one of the last wild zones on the planet, could decimate fragile ecosystems that are not yet well understood.Despite recent talks, the International Seabed Authority -- which oversees deep-sea mining in international waters -- has yet to adopt long-awaited rules governing the industry. Chinese media has previously reported that the Fendouzhe submersible mission will conduct research on "deep-sea materials".Only a handful of people have ever visited the bottom of the Mariana Trench, which is a crescent-shaped depression in the Earth's crust that is deeper than Mount Everest is high.The first explorers visited the trench in 1960 on a brief expedition.But after that, there were no missions until Hollywood director James Cameron made the first solo trip to the bottom in 2012, describing a "desolate" and "alien" environment.The water pressure at the bottom of the trench is a crushing eight tons per square inch, more than a thousand times the atmospheric pressure at sea level.Discover stories of India’s leading eco-innovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksKamala HarrisBogota AirportUS Oil ReserveTrump TariffsUPI New RulesStarlink SatelliteJulia HymanTop TrendingTravis KelceTom BradyBengaluru Boy Kidnap MurderCBSE Class 10th Sample PapersHow new nep rule worksYuzvendra Chahal DatingStephen CurryJoe BurrowBlake LivelyTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteSSC exam 2025 glitches spark massive nationwide protest: Here’s why #SSCMisManagement is trending on social mediaCAT 2025 registration begins at iimcat.ac.in: Check direct link to apply online hereAP Police Constable final result 2025 released at slprb.ap.gov.in; check direct link hereIs Yuzvendra Chahal dating RJ Mahvash?

An aerial view of the Don River in the newly unveiled Biidaasige Park, part of Toronto's Port Lands Flood Protection Project, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (AFP photo) TORONTO: The spur to build Toronto's billion-dollar-plus flood prevention project dates back to a devastating hurricane in 1954, but planners say its urgency was reinforced by the recent tragic flooding in Texas.The Port Lands project has, in part, reversed a consequence of industrialization by reconnecting Lake Ontario with the Don River, more than a century after they were severed to create an industrial area.Chris Glaisek, chief planning officer at the municipal body Waterfront Toronto, said the idea was to "heal the land from the way it was repurposed 100 years ago," with a focus on "flood protection and naturalization."The complex project -- one of the largest in Toronto's history with a cost of Can$1.4 billion (US$1 billion) -- included digging a river valley and the creation of two new river outlets, with wetlands and marshes to absorb excess water during extreme storms.The mouth of the Don River was once the Great Lakes system's largest fresh water marsh, a rich habitat and vital food resource for Indigenous people before colonization.But Toronto, like many North American cities, saw industrial growth in the late 19th Century.Much of the marsh was drained and filled in to make room for a port industrial area, while the river was re-routed into a man-made channel. The Port Lands never thrived as an industrial area, leaving a vast stretch of eastern downtown under-used, and the Don River became polluted. "It was really dirty, it was foul, it was terrible," Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow said recently. - Hurricane Hazel -On October 15, 1954 Hurricane Hazel hit Toronto, after hammering parts of the Caribbean and eastern United States.It killed 81 people across the Greater Toronto Area and served as catalyst for the city to get serious about flood protection. Hazel flooded the Humber River, in western Toronto, but Glaisek said "it was understood at the time that that same amount of rainfall, had it landed on the (eastern) Don, would have done a comparable amount of damage." He called Hazel an initial "impetus" to re-naturalize the Port Lands, but rising awareness over the past two decades about the causal link between climate change and extreme floods helped advance the project. - 'Duty bound' -To reclaim the Port Lands, Toronto partnered with the US-based landscape architecture firm Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, which has worked on the Brooklyn Bridge Park and the Obama Presidential Center in Chicago.Laura Solano, the lead designer, said the project was "duty bound to address catastrophic flooding," but stressed it offered "much more."Because the area has been reformed to cope with flood waters, parts have been declared safe for new housing -- an urgent need in the expensive metropolis.There is also a new park, trails and people can canoe or kayak through the rehabilitated Don.Solano stressed Toronto's initial decision to alter the area was consistent with the times, when North American cities moved to "industrialize their waters...to raise their economic position."But now, "every city is looking to reclaim their waters," she told AFP. The Port Lands "shows the world that it's possible to fix the past and turn deficit and remnant industrial lands into living and breathing infrastructure."- 'The river is going to flood' -As Glaisek described the project, he stood on a bank that would, by design, be under water during a major storm."It's all planned so that it can flood, the water level can rise, the river can get about three, maybe four times wider than it is now, absorb all of that volume of water," he said. "When the storm event subsides, it will shrink back down to this."It's a planning approach that recognizes "we're seeing more and more of these events.""Like in Texas, you see very tragic outcomes when you haven't really tried to plan for nature," he told AFP, referring to flash floods in early July that killed at least 135 people. He urged planners to "reposition" their relationship to nature and ditch the mindset that "humans (can) control everything.""Let's acknowledge the river is going to flood. Let's build the space for it." bs/desEnd of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousWhen Mrunal Thakur wore the most wedding-worthy Banarasi sareeLifestyle10 Indian baby names inspired by Indian languages and scriptsLifestyle10 interesting facts about Kiran Desai and her Booker Prize 2025 longlisted bookLifestyleShobha Shetty’s top 10 half-saree lookstv8 air-purifying plants for your homeLifestyleIn pics: Glamorous looks of actress Bindhu MadhavitvTake cues from Rashmika Mandanna's traditional attires this ShravanEntertainmentKnow the pros and cons of using derma rollers for faster hair growthLifestyleSai Pallavi and her love for eyelinersEntertainment10 most-friendly animals in India!Lifestyle Next123 Photostories  Priyanka Chopra said NO to these 5 hit films - Guess who got them insteadBehind the villain’s mask, Ranjeet’s real story will surprise you5 miracle oils that can actually help grow hair on bald patchesKidney vs Gallbladder stones: What's the difference and 5 very early symptoms you shouldn’t ignoreWhy are Guppy and Swordtail fish ideal starter options for new aquarists5 Friendship Day-perfect destinations in India to reconnect with your old buddiesGrow these 5 vegetables in pots – No backyard neededNo bad time to travel: 7 Indian destinations that are great year-roundTop 5 foods for muscle recoveryTrain the brain to love discipline: 7 habits that can help123Hot PicksMeteor ShowersOperation MahadevP&G CEOIndia US TradeLenskart IPOTCS share priceJulia HymanTop TrendingTaylor SwiftNBA Trade RumorsNazem KadriJarred VanderbiltBoeing 787 DreamlinerYankee Stadium Viral videoDeandre AytonVanessa BryantIndia US Trade AgreementNHL Trade RumorsTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteLondon airspace shut: All outbound UK flights hit by air traffic control 'technical issue'Saudi Arabia’s EV maker, Lucid, breaks world record with 1,205 km drive across Europe in single chargeSaikat Chakrabarti vs Nancy Pelosi: Meet Indian-American challenging Godmother of Dem Party — in her own backyardExplained: Why a Russian earthquake triggered tsunami alerts in Hawaii, Japan, and the US West CoastUAE: Will influencers need an advertiser permit to post on social media?

Kanchan trees, nature-based solution to riverbank erosion in Majuli (Image: ANI) MAJULI: In the village of Pathorichuk, Majuli, Assam, local residents have discovered a remarkable way to combat riverbank erosion by planting Kanchan trees along the Brahmaputra River. This sustainable and eco-friendly approach has proven to be a natural shield against the relentless forces of erosion.Each year, the mighty Brahmaputra, along with its tributaries Subansiri and Kherkatia, relentlessly eats away at Majuli's landmass, threatening its very existence. Traditional anti-erosion measures such as RCC porcupines and geo-bags have only offered temporary relief and have largely failed to provide long-term protection.However, the residents of Pathorichuk have discovered a sustainable and local solution. By planting large numbers of Kanchan trees along the riverbanks, the village has managed to significantly reduce the impact of erosion in the area. The deep-rooted trees not only hold the soil together but also act as a natural barrier against the strong river currents.The success of Pathorichuk village presents a compelling case for the broader adoption of ecological methods to combat erosion. Locals now urge the government, administrative bodies, and concerned departments to consider the large-scale plantation of Kanchan trees across erosion-prone areas of Majuli.If replicated effectively, this eco-friendly and cost-effective model could play a key role in safeguarding Majuli, the world's largest river island, from further disappearance. While speaking to ANI, Nirab Tai, a local from Pathorichuk village, said, "We used to face heavy erosion in the past, and our village was constantly under threat. Around 20 years ago, our elders planted these trees to prevent erosion. Since then, the erosion has completely stopped, and our village is now safe. These trees are like blessings to us, they protect us. We call them "Kanchan trees" in Assamese.""I believe that if Kanchan trees are planted along the banks of the Brahmaputra River, there will be no erosion, and all the villages near the river will be protected. These trees grow very rapidly. You don't have to do much, just plant a branch of the Kanchan tree, and it will grow, especially quickly during the monsoon season. From a single tree, many more Kanchan trees will grow.The RCC porcupines used by the government to control erosion often get submerged during the monsoon season. But these trees are doing a tremendous job. They not only protect the land but also provide a healthy environment, shade, and natural beauty." Another local, Krishna Payeng, told ANI, "These trees grow from branches. When planted near rivers, they gradually grow massively and help control soil erosion. The government should consider this seriously. Along with geo bags, if we plant Kanchan trees, erosion can be effectively controlled."He suggested distributing these trees among students and highlighting their benefits on World Environment Day."These trees should be distributed among students, and they should be informed about their benefits. On World Environment Day, the positive impact of these trees should be highlighted. I sincerely request the government to look into this matter and plant Kanchan trees in areas highly affected by erosion, not only in our country, but across the world."The success of Pathorichuk village's initiative presents a compelling case for adopting ecological methods to combat erosion. By embracing nature-based solutions, we can protect the world's largest river island, Majuli, from further disappearance.

Early Hawaiian petroglyphs on a beach are visible again with changing tides and shifting sands
Ancient Hawaiian petroglyphs, featuring human-like figures, have resurfaced on Oahu's Waianae coast after years of being hidden by sand. Seasonal ocean swells revealed the panel of over two dozen images, dating back at least 500 years. Glen Kila, a Native Hawaiian cultural expert, believes this reappearance signals a message from ancestors about rising sea levels.

Early Hawaiian petroglyphs on a beach are visible again (Image: AP) WAIANAE: Hawaiian petroglyphs dating back at least a half-millennium are visible on Oahu for the first time in years, thanks to seasonal ocean swells that peel away sand covering a panel of more than two dozen images of mostly human-looking stick figures.  The petroglyphs are easy to spot during low tide when gentle waves ebb and flow over slippery, neon-green algae growing on a stretch of sandstone. This is the first time the entire panel of petroglyphs are visible since they were first spotted nine years ago by two guests staying at a bayside US Army recreation centre in Waianae, about an hour's drive from Honolulu. Native Hawaiian cultural practitioner Glen Kila, who traces his lineage to the aboriginal families of this coastal Hawaii community, said he believes the resurfacing of the traditional marvels are his ancestors sending a message. "It's telling the community that the ocean is rising," said Kila, a recognized expert on the local culture and history of Waianae who is consulting with the Army on the protection of the petroglyphs.  Army officials are trying to balance protecting the petroglyphs with their accessibility on a public beach.  John and Sandy Stone consulted tide charts and drove about 30 minutes from their home early Tuesday to get a glimpse after a watching a local TV report about the petroglyphs.  "It was so interesting to touch them," said John Stone, who splits his time between Hawaii and California. "It felt interesting to kind of have a connection with the past like that."  It is difficult to date petroglyphs, but an archaeological site in the area is from about 600 years ago, said Laura Gilda, an archaeologist with US Army Garrison Hawaii. According to Kila, Hawaiians arrived in Waianae at least 1,000 years ago.  Shift in waves caused petroglyphs to appear The beach here fluctuates in size and profile each year, with low-pressure weather systems that form in the eastern Pacific between May and November causing waves that cut away loose sand from shorelines and redeposit them further out, according to an Army report on the petroglyphs. That shift is likely what causes their temporary exposure.  Archaeologists identified a total of 26 petroglyphs. Of the 18 anthropomorphic stick figures, eight are depicted with possible male genitalia and the remainder are of undetermined gender, the report said.  The entire panel stretches about 115 feet (35 meters) long, Gilda said.  When the petroglyphs first reemerged in July 2016, it was after late spring and early summer storms, including hurricanes, with a lot of wave action that swept the sand away, Gilda said.  They remained visible for a period and then got covered again.  "So there's been portions that have ... been exposed since then, but this is the first summer that the whole panel has been exposed again," Gilda said.  Petroglyphs are telling a religious story, expert says Based on the teachings Kila learned, the lineal petroglyphs appear to be telling a religious, ceremonial story. He interprets the largest figure, which appears to include hands and fingers with one arm raised and the other down, to represent the rising and setting sun.  Kila said that when the military in the 1930s took over the area and evicted Native Hawaiians, including his family who lived there for generations, his great-great grandmother refused to leave so his family exchanged mountain lands with a coffee plantation so she could remain near the bay.  In an interview included in the Army's report, he recalled growing up in Waianae without television. So "the ocean and mountains were our playground," he said. The Army recreation centre was off-limits to the public, and the seawall was the barrier between Native Hawaiians and the military, Kila said.  Kila, now 72, recalled that if they walked on top of the wall, they were clubbed and pushed off by military police.  "We were proud and knew where we came from, so we never fostered any hatred for the military because one day we believed that the land will eventually return to us," he said.  Kila, while visiting the petroglyphs earlier this week, told The Associated Press that the Army's protection of them represents a shift in that community relationship.  Officials have been grappling with how to share the petroglyphs with the community while also protecting them, Gilda said.  "How much attention do you want to bring to this area? You don't really want people to go digging for them when they're not exposed," she said. "But they're certainly awesome to come and see on the public beachscape." Donald Kauliʻa, a Native Hawaiian who was born and raised in Waianae, snapped photos of the petroglyphs Tuesday. Seeing them, he said, feels like "validation that our ancestors were from here."End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksParliament Monsoon SessionColumbia UniversityTesla stock earningsSovereign Gold BondsTCS new benching policyRajasthan building collapseRussian Plane MissingTop TrendingHulk Hogan WifeStephen CurryKendrick LamarUGC reformGisele BundchenConnor McDavidSteven OleksyShannon SharpeDwyane Wades WifeDylan HarperTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteBill Gates says: When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is ...TN Class 12th Supply Result 2025 Live: Tamil Nadu HSC results to be declared today, check how to download marksheets onlineUGC, AICTE, NCTE to be scrapped: Will a new super-regulator end the chaos these three could never control?Ciara and baby Amora twin in new adorable photo as fans gush over Russell Wilson's lookalike daughterWho is Hulk Hogan’s wife Sky Daily?

That's according to the international sustainability organization Global Footprint Networkand York University in Toronto, Canada.The day, which is observed annually, comes just over a week earlier than last year's date— mainly due to the fact that oceans can absorb less CO2 than previously reported.We are overconsuming by depleting nature's capital faster than it can replenish, which is visible in deforestation, loss of biodiversity and the accumulation of carbon emissions in the atmosphere. And it is part of a trend that started back in the early 1970s.Mathis Wackernagel, co-founder of the Global Footprint Network, told DW that using too many resources is driving many "environmental ills," and that regularly using more than the planet can naturally reproduce has a cumulative effect. "Even if we keep it at the same level, we increase the ecological debt that the world endures," he said, adding that the ensuing "debt is measurable."Overconsumption is a global problemQatar, Luxembourg and Singapore were first in hitting their respective country overshoot days back in February. The US was not far behind. If everyone on the planet consumed like people in the US, resources would be depleted by March 13. Germany and Poland land on May 3, China and Spain on May 23, South Africa on July 2.Wackernagel said high income "typically leads to higher resource consumption," but added that it is not the only driver.Qatar, with a desert climate with low annual rainfall and intensely hot, humid summers, relies heavily on air conditioning powered by fossil fuel energy. "They have easy access to fossil fuels, so fossil fuel use is cheap and that has a big footprint," he said, adding the country also uses up a lot of resources for the energy intensive process of desalinating seawater.Uruguay, on the other hand, is not projected to start overconsuming until December 17. It has successfully turned to renewable energy to power its grid, relying mainly on hydroelectricity, wind and biomass.Sticking to what Earth can replenishAnd then there are the countries that stay within bounds of the planet's capacity such as India, Kenya and Nigeria, among others. In order to stay within our means, the world's ecological footprint would have to equal the available biocapacity per person on our planet, which currently stands at about 1.5 global hectares.Biocapacity is defined as land and ocean areas that provide resources such as food and timber, can accommodate urban infrastructure and absorb excess CO2. Anything higher than the global available biocapacity per person is overexploiting resources.Germany has about the same amount of biocapacity per person as the global average, but uses about three times more, Wackernagel said.While India, the world's most populous country, uses more than the country itself can renew in a year, globally speaking "the level of consumption is less than one planet," he said, adding that one planet should not be the goal. "There are also other species, so we should probably be below one planet to be robust."Decades of overusing are taking a tollWackernagel said we are taking resources "far beyond what Earth can regenerate" yet have a collective understanding that what we are doing is fine. "But we're fooling ourselves."Paul Shrivastava, co-president of think tank Club of Rome, said it's time to rethink how we understand economies. "We need to change from that extractive mindset of the economy to a regenerative one," he told DW."Mining is a kind of extraction. Oil is a kind of extraction. Once we take it out of the earth, we don't give anything back," he added.Wackernagel said it's not about what we need to give up, but rather how we can prepare ourselves for the future and what will be valuable then.Rather than adjusting economies to reduce overshooting, people are trying to squeeze the last bit out of the toothpaste tube, Wackernagel said."In the United States, where I live, I could see that many of the themes around the elections last year were very overshoot related. For example, the fear of not having enough energy," he said. However, the government has failed to address the problem of overshooting and instead pushed to "drill more holes and get more fossil fuels" out of the ground. How to push back Overshoot Day?The Global Footprint Network has outlined a number of solutions in five key areas to push back the date of Earth Overshoot Day.The energy sector is by far the biggest factor at play: Placing a price on carbon emissions that reflects the true cost of carbon pollution on the planet would help move the date by 63 days.Smart cities with integrated transport systems, advanced energy management and foresight through sensors to regulate energy in buildings could add another 29 days to the calendar.Replacing coal and gas-fired power plants with renewable energy such as solar and wind and generating 75% of electricity from low-carbon sources would move the date by another 26 days.Halving food waste would provide another 13 extra days and replacing 50% of global meat consumption with plant-based alternatives would add seven days from CO2 emissions and land use alone. Just one meatless day per week would add around two days.'Vested interests in maintaining the current system'"There are vested interests in maintaining the current system" such as in fossil fuels, said Shrivastava.And while individual changes such as eating less meat, favouring biking over car rides and vacationing closer to home rank comparatively low on the power of possibility chart, voters have the power to push for systemic changes."We don't control all of that individually, but we can have a say in it and we can talk to the people who have a say in it," said Shrivastava, by engaging in peaceful protests and in supporting local political candidates that have an ecological vision. Such changes will come from the power of the people, he added."Overshoot is the second-largest risk humanity faces this century," Wackernagel said. "The largest one is not to respond."End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksParliament Monsoon SessionRussia oil sanctionsICICI BankSovereign Gold BondsTCS new benching policyVibrio VulnificusLindsey GrahamTop TrendingShane Taylor RooksNFL NetworkLeBron JamesNHL Trade RumorsConnor McDavidChristian JarosShannon SharpeDwyane Wades WifeFOX Sports Analyst Cris CarterTravis HunterTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteRishabh Pant Injury Recap: ‘He was in a lot of pain’ — Watch dramatic video from Manchester Test'Surreal': Astronomer CEO speaks out about Andy Byron's Coldplay scandal, says company has now become a household nameBill Gates says: When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is ...“My body failed me”: Dwyane Wade’s wife Gabrielle Union opens up about facing “public humiliation” after choosing surrogacyWho is Bryan Johnson: Anti-aging champion who spent $2 million a year on his body now set to shut down or sell age-reversing startup due to financial lossesWorld's largest asset manager BlackRock to employees: You cannot carry your phones and laptops to China, instead …Solar Eclipse on August 2: Why world will be under darkness for over 6 minutes in a rare 100-year phenomenon; is it visible in India?Israel's key airport attacked: Houthi millitants launch missile at Tel Aviv; bombing destroys port's dock againLawsuit or ...: Why Astronomer has not fired HR head Kristin Cabot while CEO Andy Byron resignedWho is Connor Estelle?

Mehar’s custom-engineered drone reached this remarkable milestone in an astonishing 0.91 seconds, a feat that not only demonstrates his technical prowess but also sets a new benchmark in the rapidly evolving world of drone technology.Mehar’s journey to this achievement has been anything but straightforward. His fascination with drones began in 8th grade, and this passion has only deepened over the years. With a keen interest in pushing technological boundaries, Mehar embarked on a months-long project to build a drone capable of unparalleled vertical acceleration.“I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of pushing the limits of what drones can do,” Mehar explained. “But breaking a world record wasn’t just about the end result; it was about the process. I wanted to prove that current technology could achieve something extraordinary, but the path to get there was filled with challenges.”The project required Mehar to design, test, and refine multiple drone prototypes. “There were moments when I felt like I was chasing an impossible dream,” Mehar recalled. “I went through countless designs, and many of them failed during testing. Some drones crashed so badly that I had no choice but to go back to the drawing board and start from scratch. Each crash was a setback, but it also sparked new ideas and innovations.”Undeterred by the setbacks, Mehar poured his energy into creating a drone that was not only fast but also aerodynamically optimized. “I spent countless hours on CAD software, meticulously designing and tweaking each component. The goal was to make the drone as streamlined as possible, which led me to shape it like a rocket. This design wasn’t just about aesthetics; it was about reducing drag and maximizing speed.”Mehar’s dedication to his craft paid off in spectacular fashion. “Every failure taught me something valuable,” he said. “It forced me to think creatively and to consider every detail, from the materials used to the weight distribution of the drone. The process was grueling, but it was also incredibly rewarding to see my ideas take flight—literally.”This record-breaking achievement is more than just a personal triumph for Mehar; it has significant implications for the future of drone technology. “The possibilities are endless,” Mehar mused. “High-speed vertical acceleration could revolutionize everything from emergency response to space exploration. This isn’t just about setting a record; it’s about opening doors to new innovations and applications.”Mehar’s groundbreaking work has already begun to inspire others in the drone community and beyond. “I hope this accomplishment encourages other young innovators to push their own boundaries,” he said. “Technology is advancing rapidly, and there’s so much potential waiting to be unlocked. I’m excited to see where we can go from here.”As Mehar looks ahead, the sky is truly the limit. With his record-breaking drone, he has not only made history but also set the stage for future breakthroughs in drone technology. And for this young innovator, this is just the beginning of an exciting journey into the future of flight.Disclaimer: Content produced by Mediawire on Behalf of Shweta SinghEnd of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaTop TrendingAllen IversonCam SkatteboLebron JamesDwyane WadeSharmishtha PanoliDerrick HenryTurkish Airlines DGCA warningBrad MarchandWhere to Watch NBA FinalBengaluru NewsTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteTrump ally Laura Loomer says Republican law makers wondering if they should side with President Trump or Elon Musk; Tesla CEO responds: Trump has 3.5 years left as President, but I ...Rise in COVID-19 Cases: 7 essential medical gadgets for home useThis is likely Elon Musk’s ‘Most Read’ tweet on Donald TrumpIt's War out there: Donald Trump says very disappointed with Elon Musk; Tesla CEO respondsKeep EV subsidies with you, but ..., says Very Angry Elon Musk to Donald TrumpRobots could soon replace humans to deliver your Amazon ordersAsus launches a mouse that literally makes work smell betterHow Steve Ballmer may have just agreed with Android co-founder for Bill Gates being responsible for Microsoft losing $400 billion-plus in smartphone warPoland's biggest game developer brings cyberpunk 2077 to Nintendo for the first timeMumbai's second Apple Store likely to open in Borivali: Rent, lease period and other details revealed‘Her laptop is still on the office table, but she is not’: Bengaluru techie dream ends in grief"Not knowing Calvin is wild": New York Giants rookie Cam Skattebo leaves NFL fans in disbelief after failing to recognize NFL legends in viral quiz“The true definition of a son” -NBA legend Allen Iverson shares heartfelt post on his son days after making sweet gesture towards ex-wife“Harshest critics”: Wayne Gretzky's daughter Paulina Gretzky on overcoming criticism and learning to love herself unapologeticallyUkraine's drone attack on Russia used open-source software, 'upset' developer says wanted to make flying robots: 'not in a million years...'Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis: If I were a student right now, I would study ...“It was really hard for me”- LeBron James’ wife Savannah reveals how being a teenage mother negatively impacted her sense of identityFBI reacts to Colorado attacker Mohamed Sabry Soliman not being charged with terror: 'We are not Federal Bureau of Word Games'Eid al-Adha prayer timings announced across UAE – find out the time in your cityUAE Golden Visa: Which universities make you eligible?

The formats mentioned above are most prominently used globally. JPGs can be different things like signatures required to sign documents or screenshots of an instruction manual. When converting JPG to PDF and then sharing it, you want to maintain the quality of the image. It also becomes highly convenient for the end-user to access the PDF file.There are a plethora of tools to convert JPG to PDF. Nonetheless, a tool that has gained a lot of trust in the segment is Adobe Acrobat. It simply converts any file from JPG to PDF without altering the quality. Moving ahead, we will step by step explain how you can use Adobe Acrobat to convert an image to PDF.Basic Definition of JPG and PDFJPG or JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, and it is mostly used for compressing highly detailed images, making them smaller for increasing their shareability. They are useful for sharing and storing digital images. The format is mostly used for adding images to blog posts, social media platforms, and emails.As for PDF, it includes a lot of things like images, official documents, degrees, etc. The best part about PDF is that it is a globally used format and can be easily accessed across all devices (being one of the most compatible as well). Another highlight is that it also maintains the quality of images when the size (dimensions) is increased.Why should you convert JPG to PDF? Regarding size, JPG files take less space than PDFs. However, PDF files are easily manageable, and you can also use the other services in Adobe Document Cloud to make sharing, uploading, and managing super easy. PDF will have the upper hand over JPG because the former is easily editable. Any JPG converted to PDF can be divided into different components for editing. However, the case is pretty unidentical when it comes to JPG because you cannot edit any component. When you compress a file in JPG format, it loses quality. On the other hand, PDF files are a little larger than JPG, but you will get high-quality results. How do you convert JPG to PDF on a PC? First, install Adobe Acrobat Reader on your PC; you can even do the same on your browser. Now, select the file you want to convert and wait for it to get processed.

Doordarshan will telecast live the Mangala, Shringaar, Rajbhog, Sandhya, and Shayan Aartis offered to the Ram Lalla idol at the Ayodhya Ram temple on DD National, connecting devotees who can't visit the temple. National broadcaster Doordarshan has good news for Lord Ram Devotees. Doordarshan has announced that it will telecast live the morning prayers offered to the Ram Lalla idol at the Ram Temple in Ayodhya every day.Doordarshan has shared the same in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Doordarshan said that the morning aarti offered to Ram Lalla will be telecast live on DD National every morning from 6:30 am.The national broadcaster said that the decision to telecast the morning aarti live every day was taken with the aim of connecting devotees of Lord Ram, especially after the temple was inaugurated less than two months ago in a grand ceremony and everyone can't visit the temple in person. The Aarti will be telecast simultaneously on DD’s YouTube channel also.Secondly, the decision was taken because the Trust doesn’t have logistical arrangements as of now for a live broadcast. Therefore, DD will be posting a two-three-member crew on the temple premises for the coverage of the daily ritual.DD's announcement to telecast the Aarti live for 30 minutes every morning comes after getting the go-ahead from the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust for the same. Initially, DD will air the “Mangala aarti” for a few months, and then, the Ram Temple Trust will take a call on how to take it forward.6 Aartis daily at the Ayodhya Ram templeThere are 6 aartis of Ram Lalla held daily in Ayodhya Ram temple. These include Mangala Aarti at 4:30 am, Shringaar Aarti at 6:30 am, Rajbhog Aarti at 12 noon, Utthapan Aarti at 2 pm, Sandhya Aarti at 7 pm, and Shayan Aarti at 10 pm.Giving directions to devotees for Aarti, the temple trust said, "Entry for Mangala Aarti at 4 AM, Shringar Aarti at 6:15 AM, and Shayan Aarti at 10 PM is possible only with an entry pass. No entry passes required for other Aartis."Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust advisory to devoteesIn an advisory to devotees coming for darshan at the temple, the Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra said, "Devotees can enter the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir for Darshan from 6:30 AM to 9:30 PM. The entire process from entry to exit after Darshan at the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir is extremely simple and convenient. Typically, devotees can have a smooth Darshan of Prabhu Shri Ram Lalla Sarkar within 60 to 75 minutes."The temple trust advised devotees to leave their mobile phones, footwear, purses and other personal items outside the Mandir premises for their convenience and to save time.It has also asked devotees not to bring flowers, garlands, Prasad to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

The design aims to eliminate the hinge crease and reduce the device's thickness while offering added benefits and durability. However, its practicality remains uncertain. Microsoft discontinues Surface Duo smartphones but files a patent for a new foldable device with a single hinge system called 'spine cover plate'. The design aims to eliminate the hinge crease and reduce the device's thickness while offering added benefits and durability. However, its practicality remains uncertain. Microsoft did not get the success it was anticipating with its Android-powered Surface Duo-series smartphones. The company has discontinued the lineup after the Duo 2. But, this does not mean the company has stopped trying. A new patent application filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29, reveals that the company is working on another foldable or dual-display mobile device.The patent application describes the company’s take on the foldable smartphone concept with single hinge technology called “spine cover plate”.Next Microsoft smartphones could feature a Galaxy Z Fold-like designAccording to the patent application, the phone could feature a “flexible display” in a bookstyle design similar to Galaxy Z Fold decies. However, the entire focus is on the spine cover plate mechanism which is aimed at protecting the single-hinge system of the device by covering the structural element. The differentiating factor between the regular hinge and Microsoft’s design is that the spine cover adjusts automatically during the opening and closing of the phone to prevent any unnecessary gaps around the hinge to protect it from dust as well as water. Currently, Samsung’s design offers an IPX8 rating which makes their foldables water-resistant only.The patent further mentions that the new hinge mechanism could allow Microsoft to eliminate the hinge crease less visible than the current options available in the market. Moreover, Microsoft has also mentioned techniques that could allow them to reduce the overall thickness of the foldable smartphone by allowing the spine cover plate to move closer to the device’s hinge when folded. “By retracting the spine cover plate toward the central spine as the first display-supporting frame and the second display-supporting frame are rotated into a face-to-face orientation, the width of the folded computing device is reduced, thereby enabling easier and more comfortable handling of the device, such as with one hand,” Microsoft noted in the patent.Interesting idea, but practicality is a question markThe entire smartphone market is searching for a way to eliminate the foldable crease from their smartphones. Some brands have already implemented the water-drop folding mechanism to reduce it, but there’s nothing like a crease-free foldable out there. Apart from that, the durability quotient of foldable is also important considering all the movable parts these phones have. That said, adding another layer or a movable part on top of the entire foldable mechanism does not appear like a wise move despite the added benefits and durability Microsoft has explained in the patent application.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Initiatives include partnering with the Election Commission, prioritizing trusted content on YouTube, and implementing advertising policies for transparency. Measures against AI-generated content are also taken. Google has announced a series of initiatives aimed at supporting the democratic process and safeguarding its platforms from abuse during the upcoming Indian General Election. With millions of eligible voters heading to the polls, the tech giant has said that recognises its responsibility to connect users with reliable information and counter the spread of misinformation, including AI-generated content.Easy access to voting information on Search and YouTubeGoogle has mentioned that its primary focus is on providing easy access to authoritative information from trusted sources.The company has also partnered with the Election Commission of India to showcase critical details on Google Search and YouTube, such as how to register and vote, in English and Hindi. Apart from this, YouTube’s recommendation system will prioritise trusted content during the election season. Additionally, YouTube’s homepage will prominently showcase trusted content along with an “Up Next” panel to make election-related details easily available for users. YouTube will also highlight content from trusted sources during key moments through its Top News and Breaking News as well as a news watch page. Moreover, the tech giant has also set up information panels that indicate funding sources from publishers that receive public or government funding and information panels that provide topical context for topics prone to misinformation. Safeguarding misinformationTo protect the integrity of the electoral process and to protect its products and services from abuse, Google has re-inforced its existing policies to keep its products and platforms safe while curbing misinformation at the same time. Also, the policies apply to all users, irrespective of the content type. The company has employed a combination of human reviewers and artificial intelligence models to identify and remove content that violates these policies. Google's AI capabilities are enhancing its abuse-fighting efforts, enabling faster action against emerging threats.Advertising during election campaignsTo keep things transparent when it comes to election advertising, the company requires advertisers to undergo identity verification and provide necessary certifications from the Election Commission. Election ads must also include disclosures indicating the advertiser's identity and location. Google maintains a searchable hub for all election ads, providing insights into the advertisers and their spending.Restricting AI-generated contentGoogle has also taken some steps to help identify AI-generated content through new tools and policies. The company has introduced disclosure requirements for election ads containing synthetic content and will soon require creators on YouTube to label realistic altered or synthetic content. The new ad policies prohibit the use of manipulated media to mislead people, like deepfakes or doctored content.Google has also implemented restrictions to Gemini on the types of election-related queries it will respond to and has also prioritised the provision of high-quality information. Additional features, such as the "About this Image" tool in Search and digital watermarking for AI-generated images, aim to provide users with context and assess credibility.Furthermore, Google has joined the C2PA coalition, a cross-industry effort to provide transparency and context for AI-generated content. The company has confirmed the deployment of technology to counter harmful AI-generated content aimed at deceiving voters during the 2024 elections.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

TSMC's stock rallied, elevating its market capitalisation to a record, making it higher than Broadcom. Analysts expect TSMC to further advance amid surging AI-related revenue and strong pricing power.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has reclaimed a spot in the list of the world’s 10 most valuable companies, riding the optimism of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom in the tech industry that pushed its stock to record levels.According to a report by Bloomberg, TSMC’s stock rallied 14% last week, elevating the chipmaker’s market capitalisation to a record, before a 2% decline in early trading on Monday (March 11), pared it to $634 billion. However, the decline didn’t impact the company much as it still has a market share higher than that of Broadcom, the report noted.What analysts have to sayAnalysts from Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. expect the semiconductor giant – that has Apple, Nvidia and Qualcomm as its customers – to advance further amid surging AI-related revenue and strong pricing power. “Generative AI semi is an obvious growth driver for TSMC,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Charlie Chan wrote in a note last week. The company’s overseas expansion also helps mitigate geopolitical concerns, they said.TSMC’s revenue gained 9.4% in the first two months of 2024 as demand for high-end chips increased due to a wave of activity in AI.Nvidia gets ‘AI boost’This is not the first time this year that a chip company has seen its stock on an upward spiral. This year, Nvidia was among the companies that got a boost by a frenzy around generative AI.In the last month, Nvidia stock price has risen over 20% while in the last six months, it has risen over 90%. Moreover, in the last one year, Nvidia stock price has appreciated from $234.36 per share level to $875.28 per share mark – registering a 275% jump.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

The update combines gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer data, reducing magnetic interference and benefiting Google Maps and third-party apps on Android 5.0 or above. Google Maps is updating its Fused Orientation Provider (FOP) API to improve direction accuracy in busy areas. The update combines gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer data, reducing magnetic interference and benefiting Google Maps and third-party apps on Android 5.0 or above. We keep hearing about Google Maps fiasco from across the globe where it directed people in some odd direction and eventually got them stuck in a ‘worst case scenario’. Now a new post published on the Android Developers blog gives an insight about Maps getting a new update to better with directions. The post talks about a potential upgrade that Maps will be getting with the Fused Orientation Provider (FOP) API that aims to make the ‘orientation’ detection better on Android devices, irrespective of the hardware used by different OEMs on their devices. According to the post, the update will make Maps interpret the directions better to make it more accurate by combining the gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer data. However, this idea of Google using data from all the sensors isn’t new, the company has used the API before, but the update will make better magnetic interference. As per the post, the changes will not only apply to Google Maps but also third-party apps that rely on Google Maps to offer navigational data. It is to be noted that the update will be done with internals of the Google Maps, it won’t affect the user interface or the layout of the app. Also, the updated API will be rolled out from the server side or via the app update in Android devices running Android 5.0 or above. How it will affect usersAs mentioned, the update won’t change anything in terms of the app’s design or user interface. The changes are internal in the form of API which will be pushed automatically via the update. That said, the update is set to make it better with directions, especially in busy areas.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Musk announces xAI open sourcing Grok chatbot. OpenAI CEO Altman takes a dig at Musk's chatbot. Musk, obviously didn't like the jab and replied with a long-ish message saying “GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.”  Elon Musk has been extremely critical of ChatGPT maker OpenAI for deviating from its mission to develop AI for the benefit of humanity and taking a profit-making path. He has advocated that artificial intelligence (AI) should be accessible for all, and he has now announced that his AI startup xAI will open source Grok chatbot this week.“This week, @xAI will open source Grok,” Musk said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).In simpler words, open-sourcing a software, like a chatbot, means that the software projects are redistributable as all source code is accessible by everyone. One of the advantages of having open source software is that it provides flexibility to an enterprise to have multiple ways of fixing a problem rather than waiting for an internal team to provide a solution.“OpenAI is a lie”Meanwhile, a user suggested that OpenAI should do the same.“OpenAI should do the same if they are ‘open’ that is,” the user said. Musk replied, “OpenAI is a lie.”Musk wants AI technology to be open-source Musk had floated the idea of open-sourcing AI during a podcast in November last year. In a podcast with Lex Fridman, Musk suggested that he likes the idea of open-source AI. “I am generally in favour of open sourcing, like biassed towards open sourcing,” he said.His comments came soon after his AI company called xAI released Grok, its chatbot, which reportedly took four months to build. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was quick to take a dig at this and shared a post in which he built Grok with a single prompt on GPT Builder."GPTs can save a lot of effort:” he said.Musk, obviously didn't like the jab and replied with a long-ish message saying “GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.” About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Ruby Johnson filed a lawsuit against Detective Gary Staab and Sgt. Gregory Buschy.  Apple's Find My app has cost the city of Denver, US $3.76 million in compensation and damages. In 2022, the city’s police wrongly raided and ransacked an elderly woman's home looking for a stolen truck and guns. According to a report by CNN, Denver police were seeking to recover a stolen truck loaded with guns, ammo and cash. For this, the police used Apple's Find My technology on another iPhone to locate the vehicle.However, the police picked the wrong house out of a fairly wide area to storm in and catch the thieves. Due to this misplaced raid, 78-year-old Ruby Johnson filed a lawsuit against the police. As compensation, the city will be paying Johnson a $3.76 million award. Moreover, the defendant officers — Detective Gary Staab and Sgt. Gregory Buschy — were also sued as an individual. Denver police had previously cleared both men of wrongdoing, but the jury disagreed.How Apple’s Find My app played a roleThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) brought the case on behalf of Johnson. The lawsuit mentioned that the raid was conducted based on an “alleged location ping from an iPhone's Find My app that the officers did not understand and for which they had no training." As per the complaint, the police relied on a "Find My" ping from an iPhone 11 that was probably still in the stolen truck. However, the area identified included parts of six other properties across parts of four city blocks.In a statement, Johnson's attorney Tim Macdonald said: “We are disturbed by the lack of training or policy changes and hope that the amount of the punitive damages award will send a strong message that the police department must take seriously the constitutional rights of its residents.” The ACLU and the jury concluded that the two police officers who ordered the raid had no reason to single out Johnson's house as the target. Also, the officers have to pay nearly $1.25 million each in punitive and compensatory damages. A Denver District Court clerk noted that the city has not yet filed an appeal of the verdict.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

A bill to sell TikTok is introduced, backed by President Biden. Kotick discussed acquisition with OpenAI head. Activision Blizzard faced a lawsuit. Concerns about data privacy and ties to China persist. TikTok urges American users to support it.  Bobby Kotick, the former head of Activision Blizzard, is reportedly considering buying TikTok, as the app could be banned in the United States. The Wall Street Journal reports that Kotick has talked to ByteDance, the company that owns TikTok, about buying the app, which could cost hundreds of billions of dollars.This comes as US lawmakers introduce a new bill that would make ByteDance sell TikTok within six months or stop it from being available in US app stores.President Joe Biden has said he would approve the bill if it passes in Congress.The Wall Street Journal report adds that Kotick, the head of OpenAI, Sam Altman, discussed teaming up to buy TikTok at a dinner last week. Kotick's interest in TikTok follows a rough end to his 30 years leading Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft acquired last year. The company faced a lawsuit saying it allowed sexual harassment and discrimination under Kotick's leadership. The Wall Street Journal also said Kotick knew about bad behaviour and didn't tell the board everything. Kotick was accused of harassment, but Activision Blizzard said the report was "misleading."Lawmakers are worried about data privacy and TikTok's ties to China. US President Biden, whose administration has banned the app already on state devices, has expressed his support for banning the app in the US. However, former President Donald Trump, who once wanted to ban TikTok, has changed his mind, saying a ban would help TikTok's rivals, like Facebook and YouTube. As the bill against TikTok gains support, the app has asked its American users to speak up for it, sending messages telling users to call their representatives. The bill, which passed a committee last week, is expected to be approved when the House votes on Wednesday. If it passes, it will then go to the Senate, and then the bill will be signed by the President of the US.Former Activision boss reportedly wants to buy TikTokAbout the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Reason is said to be delay in the delivery of two supercomputers by the French company to Indian weather forecasting institutes. According to a report in news agency PTI, the Earth Sciences Ministry had ordered two supercomputers worth $100 million from French firm Eviden, of the Atos Group, last year to enhance the computing capabilities of its institutions -- the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM)."I am more upset because the target we set was December. The Union Cabinet had already approved purchasing the supercomputer. We have only four petaflop capacity. We want to install up to 18 petaflop capacity," Rijiju told PTI in a video interview.He said that the French company ran into some financial trouble and wanted the government to make payment to its subsidiary.Minister says that the delay is causing him "worry"Rijiju said that the delay has caused him lots of worry as the company has overshot the timeline. "But I think we will sort it out soon," he said, adding that the government wanted to be "very correct in our position legally"."We are ready to release the money because we want the machine immediately. The only problem is the amount is not small. So if we pay now, if the company is bankrupt or something happens, who will bail out," the minister said.Rijiju further added that the government was taking some steps to speed up the delivery of the supercomputer but did not elaborate. "But I hope the French government will also intervene because we have a good understanding and a very good relationship with the French government."Since it is a high-cost equipment, we want to ensure that the transaction happens duly and properly," he said."From outside, everything's ready. It is only the problem with the main company. They want us to pay their subsidiary. We will pay only to a company whom we have entered an MoU with," Rijiju said.The supercomputing system, based on Eviden's BullSequana XH2000, is said to have a combined power capacity of up to 21.3 petaflops.Supercomputer at IITMThe supercomputer at the Pune-based IITM will provide 13 petaflops of computing power for atmosphere and climate research. As per the PTI report, it will integrate 3,000 CPU nodes using AMD EPYC 7643 processors and 26 GPU nodes through NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. The system will benefit from the NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand networking platform with In-Network Computing, 3PB all flash and 29PB disk-based DDN EXAScaler ES400NVX2 storage and Micron high-technology memory.The existing computing facility at NCMRWF is 2.8 petaflops and at IITM is 4 petaflops, respectively.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

From cultural events to historic quotes by Bhagat Singh, Ambedkar, Nehru, Azad, and Gandhi, the day echoed pride and purpose. Citizens shared heartfelt wishes, pledging peace, resilience, and a united vision for India’s future.  India today stands draped in the tricolour, marking 79 years since it cast off the yoke of British colonial rule on August 15, 1947. The anniversary of freedom is not merely a date on the calendar — it is a reminder of the long, arduous struggle waged by freedom fighters and ordinary citizens who dreamed of a sovereign nation. Across the country, streets are alive with cultural programmes, rallies, flag processions, marathons, and seminars, all paying homage to those who sacrificed their lives for India’s liberty.Echoes of the freedom struggle resonate across IndiaThis year’s celebrations carry a dual spirit — a commemoration of the past and a vision for the future. Voices from history echo through the nation’s consciousness, reminding people why freedom must be cherished and protected. As Sardar Bhagat Singh once proclaimed, "May the sun in his course visit no land more free, more happy, more lovely, than this our country!"Words from the icons who shaped India’s destinyThe fight for independence was never solely about political sovereignty; it was about liberating the human spirit. BR Ambedkar’s words resonate deeply in this regard: "Freedom of mind is real freedom. A person whose mind is not free, though he may not be in chains, is a slave, not a free man. One whose mind is not free, though he may not be in prison, is a prisoner and not a free man. One whose mind is not free, though alive, is no better than dead. Freedom of mind is the proof of one's existence."For Chandra Shekhar Azad, the essence of freedom lay in self-discipline and personal excellence: "Don't see others doing better than you beat your own records every day, because success is a fight between you and yourself."From Bhagat Singh to Gandhi: Messages that still inspireThe country’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, captured the essence of responsible citizenship in a single line: "Citizenship consists in the service of the country."And Mahatma Gandhi, the moral compass of India’s independence movement, summed up the invaluable nature of liberty: "Freedom is never dear at any price. It is the breath of life. What would a man not pay for living?"Citizens share heartfelt Independence Day wishesAs citizens wave the national flag today, many share heartfelt wishes that echo the spirit of unity and progress: "Happy Independence Day to you and your family. May this day be a reminder of the wonderful country we live in and how we worked hard for its freedom." Others look ahead with optimism: "Happy Independence Day 2025. Here's to building a stronger, powerful and more resilient India."There is also a call for togetherness: "On this Independence Day, let's unite as one nation and celebrate the diversity that makes us strong." The emotional fervour continues with words of hope: "May the spirit of freedom and patriotism ignite in our hearts. Happy Independence Day!" and "Let's celebrate our nation's sovereignty and freedom. Wishing you a Happy Independence Day!"Looking ahead: A resilient and united IndiaFinally, the collective aspiration for peace and prosperity is clear in the message: "May our country always be blessed with peace, prosperity and harmony. Happy Independence Day!"Seventy-nine years on, India celebrates not just its hard-won sovereignty but the enduring responsibility to guard and nurture it. Today’s Independence Day is both a tribute to history and a promise to the future, that the sacrifices of the past will continue to inspire a united, resilient, and forward-looking nation.Ready to navigate global policies?

NEET MDS revised cut off list released: The National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences (NBEMS) has officially revised the cut-off marks for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test for Masters of Dental Surgery (NEET MDS) 2025, following a directive from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW). The move comes after the Health Ministry ordered a reduction of 19.863 percentile points in the minimum qualifying percentiles for all categories, including General, SC/ST/OBC, and UR-PwBD.The NEET MDS 2025 results were initially declared on May 15, 2025. However, in a letter dated August 10, 2025 (No. V.12025/84/2024-DE), the Health Ministry instructed NBEMS to implement the percentile reduction in accordance with the Dental Council of India’s MDS Regulations, 2017, and the amended provisions under the Master of Dental Surgery Course Regulations, 2018.Revised NEET MDS 2025 qualifying percentiles and scoresThe updated qualifying benchmarks for the 2025–26 academic session are:CategoryEarlier Qualifying PercentileEarlier Cut-Off Score (out of 960)Revised Qualifying PercentileRevised Cut-Off Score (out of 960)General (UR/EWS)50 percentile26130.137 percentile197General-PwBD45 percentile24425.137 percentile182SC/ST/OBC (including PwBD of SC/ST/OBC)40 percentile22720.137 percentile168This recalibration is expected to widen the pool of eligible candidates, allowing more aspirants to participate in the counselling process for postgraduate dental seats.Advisory to candidatesNBEMS has stated that the NEET MDS 2025 information bulletin should be read in light of these changes.

Offering incentives to both first-time employees and employers, the programme aims to lower hiring costs, formalise jobs, boost workplace mobility, and spur economic growth across sectors, especially in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. Prime Minister Narendra Modi Independence Day Speech Independence Day speeches often stir emotion; this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address also carried a clear, data-backed economic intent. From the Red Fort, beneath the sweep of the tricolour, he unveiled the Pradhan Mantri Viksit Bharat Rozgar Yojana (PM-VBRY), a ₹99,446 crore national jobs drive that could directly shape the careers of millions and recalibrate India’s labour market dynamics.“Today, I bring good news for the youth of our country. From today, under the PM Viksit Bharat Rozgar Yojana, sons and daughters getting their first job in the private sector will be given ₹15,000,” he announced.The scheme began on August 1, 2025, replacing the Employment Linked Incentive Scheme. Its ambitions are unmistakable: 3.5 crore new jobs in two years, including 1.92 crore for first-time entrants. But beyond the headline numbers lies a design that could ripple through boardrooms, shop floors, and HR departments, reshaping how India works.What is PM Viksit Bharat Rozgar Yojana?The scheme operates on two fronts. First, individuals securing their first private sector job with a monthly salary of up to ₹1 lakh will receive incentives of up to ₹15,000, disbursed in two instalments, the first after six months, and the second after one year, contingent on attending a financial awareness programme. A portion of this incentive will be earmarked in a savings account to cultivate long-term saving habits.Second, employers expanding their workforce will receive subsidies of up to ₹3,000 per month per new hire for two years, with manufacturing units eligible for benefits for up to four years. This applies to employers registered with the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) who add at least two employees (if the workforce is under 50) or five employees (if over 50).Two-way incentives: Why it matters for working professionalsUnlike one-sided job schemes, PM-VBRY incentivises both employees and employers:For first-time employees: A ₹15,000 payout (split over one year) is more than a welcome cash infusion — it’s a bridge into formal employment. The financial literacy training attached to the benefit could equip young workers with budgeting skills, savings discipline, and an early grasp of provident fund and insurance systems. This matters in a country where household financial planning often starts too late.For existing working professionals: The employer incentive of ₹3,000 per new hire per month — for up to two years (four for manufacturing) — could indirectly boost existing staff morale and career mobility. Companies expanding headcount often create internal promotions, team expansions, and upskilling opportunities for current employees, breaking the stagnation many mid-level professionals face.For gig and contract workers: By requiring EPFO registration for participating employers, the scheme subtly nudges firms to formalise roles, opening the door to social security for those currently outside the safety net.Job growth mechanics: How PM-VBRY could trigger expansionThe scheme’s architecture aligns neatly with the realities of India’s post-pandemic labour market:Lower hiring costs = Higher recruitment appetiteWage subsidies can make the marginal cost of a new hire 15–20% cheaper for employers, particularly in labour-intensive manufacturing, retail, and logistics. This is a significant hiring catalyst in sectors where payroll costs deter expansion.First-job bonus = Reduced attritionYoung employees with a financial incentive tied to staying six months to a year are less likely to leave prematurely. Lower churn rates mean companies spend less on constant rehiring and training.Boost to Tier-2 and Tier-3 citiesEPFO-registered firms in smaller towns stand to gain from easier recruitment, potentially decentralising job growth from metros to emerging industrial and service hubs.Multiplier effect in allied industriesJob creation in manufacturing and services naturally fuels demand in transport, food services, education, and housing, creating a second wave of indirect employment.The hard numbers: Debunking the gloom narrativeThe timing of PM-VBRY also challenges the “jobless growth” perception peddled by selective opinion polls. The NSO’s Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) — the gold-standard, ILO-recognised dataset — reports:Unemployment rate (15+) down from 6.0% in 2017–18 to 3.2% in 2023–24.Labour Force Participation Rate up from 49.8% to 60.1%.Youth unemployment down to 10.2%, below the global average of 13.3% (ILO, 2024).16.83 crore new jobs added between 2017–18 and 2023–24 (RBI KLEMS database).Formalisation is accelerating: 1.29 crore net EPFO subscribers joined in 2024–25, compared to 61.12 lakh in 2018–19.Beyond numbers: Why professionals should pay attentionThe PM-VBRY is not just for freshers; it could reshape the employment culture in ways that affect experienced professionals:Faster company growth means more vertical movement and the chance to lead expanding teams.Formalisation push means better HR compliance, predictable pay cycles, and benefits coverage.Geographical spread of jobs could give skilled professionals more location flexibility without sacrificing salary levels.A lever for the demographic dividendIndia’s demographic advantage, 65% of its population under 35, is both an asset and a challenge. Without structured entry points into the formal workforce, young potential can easily turn into a demographic liability. PM-VBRY, by directly rewarding hiring and retention, aims to convert that potential into productivity.If implemented with rigour, and paired with existing skilling programmes like Skill India, PMEGP, and the NEP 2020 framework, the scheme could become a pivot point in India’s employment story, one that working professionals will feel in promotions, pay cheques, and workplace dynamism over the next two years.Ready to navigate global policies?

CBSE clarified such operators are unauthorised and urged reliance only on its official website, stressing it will not be liable for losses from third-party dealings.  The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has issued a public advisory cautioning students, parents, and educational stakeholders about fraudulent operators promising quick solutions for duplicate mark sheets, certificates, and corrections in official records.According to the CBSE Regional Office, Delhi (East), certain individuals and platforms are spreading “misleading and unauthentic claims” of facilitating these services. The Board has categorically denied any association with such agents.“Relying on these unofficial channels may lead to misinformation, financial loss, or other serious consequences,” the CBSE stated, urging people to remain alert and avoid engaging with such entities.Only official portal recognised for document servicesThe Board stressed that legitimate procedures for obtaining duplicate documents, making corrections, or availing other examination-related services are available exclusively through its official website — www.cbse.gov.in.In its advisory, the CBSE made it clear that it will not be held responsible for any loss, dispute, or inconvenience caused by transactions with unauthorised intermediaries.Public interest advisory to curb scamsThe CBSE underlined that the advisory was issued in the public interest to safeguard students and parents from falling victim to fraudulent claims. The warning follows increasing reports of scams in which vulnerable families, desperate for urgent documentation, were lured by false promises of faster service.By reiterating the need for verification and compliance with official procedures, the Board aims to curb the exploitation of students and their families by unverified sources.Ready to navigate global policies?

The US Department of Education has opened investigations into four Kansas school districts over alleged violations of Title IX and FERPA. The inquiry follows complaints that the districts allow students access to sports and facilities based on gender identity and restrict parental access to related information. Officials cite concerns over legal non-compliance and potential breaches of parental rights.

The inquiry follows complaints that the districts allow students access to sports and facilities based on gender identity and restrict parental access to related information. Officials cite concerns over legal non-compliance and potential breaches of parental rights. Investigations are ongoing and could result in the withdrawal of federal funding if violations are confirmed. Kansas schools face US probe over gender identity and privacy policies. (AI Image) The US Department of Education has launched investigations into four Kansas school districts over allegations that their gender identity policies may violate federal laws. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and the Student Privacy Policy Office (SPPO) are examining the conduct of Topeka Public Schools, Shawnee Public Schools, Olathe Public Schools, and Kansas City, Kansas Public Schools.The investigation follows a complaint filed by the Defense of Freedom Institute (DFI), which alleges that the districts' policies allow students to participate in sports and access facilities based on gender identity rather than biological sex. The complaint also claims that school officials are prohibited from informing parents of a student’s transgender status without the student’s consent.Investigations focus on Title IX and FERPA complianceThe Department of Education is investigating whether these policies breach Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Title IX prohibits discrimination based on sex in educational programmes receiving federal financial assistance, while FERPA protects the privacy of student education records and grants parents the right to access and control certain disclosures of this information.According to the Department, violations of either law can result in the termination of federal funding to the school districts involved.Kansas Attorney General and Education Secretary respondKansas Attorney General Kris Kobach submitted a letter to US Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, expressing concern about the districts’ policies and potential violations of federal law. Kobach stated, “Title IX was enacted to protect the rights of girls to equal educational opportunity and safety. Kansas had to sue and defeat the Biden Administration in federal court to stop them from dismantling Title IX.”In response, Secretary McMahon noted that her office would “vigorously investigate these matters to ensure these practices come to an end.” She added, “The Kansas districts’ alleged behaviour of allowing gender ideology to run amok in their schools is an affront not only to the law, but to the sound judgement we expect from our educational leaders.”Department guidance on parental rights and student privacyIn March, the SPPO issued a Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) to state superintendents, reminding them of their compliance obligations under FERPA. The letter described policies that hide a child’s gender identity from parents as a “priority concern.” Secretary McMahon also included a cover letter stating that “by natural right and moral authority, parents are the primary protectors of their children.”FERPA provides parents with the right to access their children’s education records, request amendments, and limit the disclosure of personally identifiable information, with specific exceptions. Any instruction to staff to withhold information about a child’s gender identity from parents may infringe on these rights.Potential consequences for districts under investigationShould the Department of Education find that the districts are in violation of Title IX or FERPA, the consequences may include the withdrawal of federal funding. The investigations are ongoing, and the Department has not yet announced any findings or enforcement actions.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now. Follow us here.Ready to navigate global policies?

Newsom calls for Harvard president's resignation over Trump deal: Here's why critics say the agreement is surrender, not compromise
California Governor Gavin Newsom has called for Harvard University President Alan Garber's resignation amid reports of a $500 million settlement with the Trump administration. Critics argue the deal represents surrender, not compromise, as it may set a precedent for further federal demands on universities. Harvard's initial resistance has drawn internal opposition and public support, while Newsom vows to oppose similar demands targeting other Californian institutions such as UCLA.

Harvard faces backlash as Newsom demands resignation amid Trump administration settlement talks. (ANI Photo) California Governor Gavin C. Newsom has called for the resignation of Harvard University President Alan M. Garber over reports that the University is nearing a settlement with the Trump administration. Newsom's remarks were posted on social media platform X, where he criticised Harvard's ongoing negotiations with the White House regarding the restoration of research funding."An absolute failure of leadership that will have demonstrable impacts to higher education across our country," Newsom wrote, as reported by The Harvard Crimson. He added, "He should be ashamed," referring to Garber. Newsom's statement follows increasing criticism from Democratic politicians and affiliates who oppose any settlement with the current US administration.Harvard reportedly in final stages of deal with Trump administrationHarvard University and the Trump administration resumed negotiations in June to restore billions of dollars in research funding. According to reports from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, the White House is demanding a settlement of approximately $500 million, and discussions are reportedly in the final stages.Newsom's post came amid broader concerns over similar deals between the federal government and Ivy League institutions. Columbia University and Brown University reached settlements earlier this summer, with Columbia agreeing to pay $200 million and submit to federal oversight, including restrictions on student protests and a review of academic programmes. Brown committed $50 million to a workforce development initiative in Rhode Island.As reported by The Harvard Crimson, Democratic lawmakers, including 14 Harvard alumni in Congress, warned the University of a potential investigation should it proceed with the agreement. Critics argue that Harvard's compliance would set a precedent for future federal demands on academic institutions.Newsom joins other Democrats in opposing dealNewsom, considered a potential Democratic presidential candidate for 2028, joined a growing number of politicians expressing opposition to the deal. In a separate post quoted by The Harvard Crimson, Newsom wrote, "You don't work with Donald Trump — only FOR Donald Trump," and added, "Looks like Harvard has chosen to surrender."Newsom's office did not respond to a request for comment, and Harvard officials have declined to comment on the situation, according to The Harvard Crimson.Trump administration also targets California universityNewsom's statements were also tied to reports that the Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in exchange for the restoration of over $500 million in research funding. A federal judge has since ordered the funding to be reinstated.As per The Harvard Crimson, Newsom responded, "CALIFORNIA WILL NEVER BEND THE KNEE," and has threatened to initiate legal action, adding to the 37 lawsuits California has filed against the administration.Harvard's initial resistance and growing internal oppositionEarlier in the year, Harvard refused demands from the Trump administration and subsequently filed two lawsuits. This resistance was publicly supported by the Cambridge City Council and Massachusetts Democrats, according to The Harvard Crimson.However, reports from The Harvard Crimson indicate that internal divisions persist. While some faculty members view a potential agreement as pragmatic, others have voiced strong opposition. Groups such as Crimson Courage and Students for Freedom have circulated open letters urging the University to reject political interference. Crimson Courage's letter stated, "We cannot stand for ‘veritas' if we refuse to stand up for truth when the moment demands it."Harvard's chapter of the American Association of University Professors also warned, "Extortion payments are rarely a one-time affair," as reported by The Harvard Crimson.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

15-year-old Los Angeles student wrongly detained at gunpoint: How is LAUSD protecting its schools from immigration raids?
A 15-year-old Los Angeles student with disabilities was wrongly detained at gunpoint outside Arleta High School by immigration agents in a case of mistaken identity, sparking outrage and prompting LAUSD to bolster safety measures. The district has introduced safe zones, virtual schooling, legal aid, and family support programs to protect immigrant students and address trauma-induced absenteeism and anxiety.

The district has introduced safe zones, virtual schooling, legal aid, and family support programs to protect immigrant students and address trauma-induced absenteeism and anxiety.  A routine school registration turned into a flashpoint over immigration enforcement in Los Angeles recently, when a 15-year-old boy with significant disabilities was allegedly detained at gunpoint outside Arleta High School. According to Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) officials, the incident unfolded as federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security approached the family of a female student who was registering at the school.“Today, unidentified immigration agents handcuffed, detained, and drew their guns on a BD6 student outside Arleta High School in an alleged case of mistaken identity,” LAUSD Board Member Kelly Gonez said in a statement. “Such actions — violently detaining a child just outside a public school — are absolutely reprehensible and should have no place in our country.”The boy was ultimately released at the scene. According to media reports, he is a student at San Fernando High School and had gone to Arleta High only to accompany a family member for registration, according to media reports. The campus falls within LAUSD’s Board District 6, which covers the eastern San Fernando Valley and is represented by Board Member Kelly Gonez. For LAUSD, the detention was more than an isolated enforcement action; it was a wake-up call to reinforce its role as a protector of vulnerable students. So, LSAUD is strengthening its safety measures to keep school kids safe. Here is how.Safe zones and virtual schoolsIn response to incidents such as this, LAUSD has strengthened safety protocols to create “safe zones” at and around school campuses. The district has established rapid-response protocols to address any future encounters with immigration personnel. These measures are designed to protect students from undue stress or disruption while on or near school grounds.LAUSD also continues to offer virtual schooling options for students affected by immigration enforcement. By enabling online learning, the district ensures continuity in education for students whose families may feel apprehensive about attending in-person classes. Enrollment in these virtual programs has reportedly increased in recent months, reflecting both the demand for alternative learning options and the anxiety that students and families are experiencing.Support for familiesBeyond physical safety, LAUSD has introduced a suite of initiatives to support the emotional and legal needs of immigrant families. These include:A 24/7 family hotline that provides assistance with immigration and mental health concerns.Legal referrals as part of the district’s 2025 “We Are One” campaign, which aims to actively involve immigrant families in school affairs.The “We Have Rights” empowerment campaign, offering guidance on common immigration enforcement encounters through animated resources in seven languages.Weekly workshops beginning August 22 to educate students and families on their legal rights and to provide practical support in navigating enforcement situations.These initiatives are part of LAUSD’s broader effort to ensure that immigrant families feel included, supported, and informed within the school community.The new lesson plan in America’s schools: FearRecent immigration enforcement policies under the Trump administration — marked by ambiguity over who will be arrested and how long they may be detained — are fueling chronic anxiety among students. This anxiety, according to a July report by psychiatric researchers at the University of California, Riverside, and New York University, has been linked to absenteeism, classroom disengagement, and heightened emotional distress. The researchers wrote that such fears have driven some students “to avoid school or withdraw from public life.”While the report underscores schools’ importance in identifying and supporting students’ mental health needs early, it also warns that they can become sites where immigrant youth “experience trauma-related avoidance, disengagement, or behavioral challenges.”TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

New York’s job engine sputters with just 956 new positions in the first six months of 2025: Is this a recession warning for young professionals?
New York's job market is showing signs of weakness, with a significant drop in private-sector job creation in the first half of 2025. Only 956 new jobs were added, a sharp contrast to the 66,000 created last year. This slowdown, attributed to rising costs, political tensions, and technological shifts like AI, is raising concerns about a potential recession.

Only 956 new jobs were added, a sharp contrast to the 66,000 created last year. This slowdown, attributed to rising costs, political tensions, and technological shifts like AI, is raising concerns about a potential recession.  New York, once the lodestar of America’s labour market, is losing some of its shine. According to the city’s Mayor’s Office of Management and Budget, the first half of 2025 produced just 956 new private-sector jobs—the feeblest gain outside a recession or pandemic since 2003. The contrast with the 66,000 positions created in the same period last year is stark. Such anaemic growth is stirring fears that the slowdown is less a local hiccup than an early warning of a broader recession, with the city’s newest workers—graduates and young professionals—likely to bear the brunt.A job market under pressureThe numbers released by N.Y.C. Office of Management and Budget are striking. As per the report, the city added 66,000 jobs in the same period last year, highlighting the dramatic slowdown. Projections for the full year suggest roughly 31,900 new positions, far below pre-pandemic levels of around 100,000 annually. The report also highlights the unemployment rate in the city, which stands at 4.7% — higher than the state and national averages, with younger workers particularly affected.As reported by the New York Times, sectors like finance and insurance have seen losses, shedding thousands of jobs, while hospitality and retail continue to struggle. Mid-level positions—the backbone of NYC’s workforce—are shrinking, leaving graduates and early-career professionals with fewer opportunities.Stalled hiring: What’s the trigger?Economists point to multiple contributing factors. Rising costs from on-again, off-again tariffs have made companies hesitant to expand. Political tensions have reduced tourism, affecting restaurants, hotels, and retail businesses. At the same time, technological shifts, especially the adoption of AI in finance and professional services, are reshaping hiring practices and reducing demand for new employees. Some firms are even considering relocating offices to lower-cost states such as Florida and Texas.Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told the New York Times, "The New York City economy has gone sideways so far this year. New York is a leading indicator, and the flattening of employment is now showing up nationally."Implications for students and young professionalsFor those just starting their careers, the slowdown signals a need to rethink traditional approaches to job hunting. Adaptability is critical, and developing technical skills alongside strong soft skills like communication, problem-solving, and critical thinking has become more important than ever.Geographic flexibility and openness to remote work can help students access opportunities beyond traditional hubs. Leveraging career centers, city programs, and networking opportunities can make a tangible difference, especially when competition is high. Staying informed about broader economic trends can also guide strategic decisions about career paths and timing of entry into the workforce.Looking aheadNew York City’s hiring stall serves as a warning that no job market is immune to economic, political, and technological disruptions. Lauren Melodia, director of economic and fiscal policy at the New School, told the New York Times, "It is shocking because we aren't in a recession. At the same time, it's not shocking given the political environment and impact on the economy."For students and graduates, the key takeaway is clear: preparing for uncertainty, diversifying skills, and being proactive in career planning are no longer optional—they are essential for navigating today’s evolving job market.Ready to navigate global policies?

From his education at Dhirubhai Ambani International School to graduating from Mumbai University, he balanced academics with cricket. He debuted for India U-19 in 2018 and later joined Mumbai Indians in the IPL. A move to Goa provided more playing time, highlighted by a first-class century. Arjun Tendulkar with father and cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar (Image: Instagram) In India, where cricket often feels like a second religion, a name like Tendulkar carries expectations that are hard to escape. Born on September 24, 1999, to Sachin Tendulkar, one of the game’s most celebrated figures, Arjun Tendulkar has grown up in the public eye. His journey so far has been a mix of steady steps in education, a developing cricket career, and most recently, a new chapter in his personal life—his engagement to Saaniya Chandok, granddaughter of Mumbai businessman Ravi Ghai.Schooling and academic base Arjun began his education at the Dhirubhai Ambani International School in Mumbai, an institution known for its rigorous academics and well-rounded approach to student development. There, he built the foundations of his education while also pursuing cricket. Balancing both academics and sport, he went on to complete his graduation from Mumbai University, signalling that studies remained part of his plan even as cricket took centre stage.Early steps in cricketArjun’s cricketing journey started in Mumbai’s junior teams, where he began to pick up match experience and develop his skills. The first significant milestone came in 2018, when he made his under-19 debut for India against Sri Lanka. On January 15, 2021, he played his first T20 match for Mumbai in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy against Haryana, taking one wicket for 34 runs in his three overs.IPL entry and challengesAhead of the 2021 Indian Premier League season, Mumbai Indians brought Arjun into their squad at the player auction. He was first picked in Mumbai’s senior Syed Mushtaq Ali squad on January 2, 2021. In late September 2021, he was ruled out of the 2021 IPL due to injury, delaying his chance to make an impact. The Mumbai Indians signed him again in February 2022, reflecting continued interest in his potential, even if opportunities remained limited.A move to Goa and first-class cricketIn August 2022, Arjun took the decision to leave Mumbai cricket and join Goa for the domestic season, a shift aimed at securing more playing time and responsibility. Representing Goa in the 2022–23 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and Ranji Trophy, he made his first-class debut on December 13, 2022, against Rajasthan. Batting in the first innings, he scored 120 runs off 207 balls—his maiden century in first-class cricket. The innings was a highlight in his career so far and offered a glimpse of his potential in longer formats.IPL debut and first wicketOn April 16, 2023, Arjun made his IPL debut for Mumbai Indians against Kolkata Knight Riders. Shortly afterwards, in a match against Sunrisers Hyderabad, he claimed his first IPL wicket by dismissing Bhuvneshwar Kumar. These moments, though modest in the larger scheme of the tournament, marked personal milestones in his progression as a player.A career still in progressArjun Tendulkar’s cricketing record so far may not yet match the weight of his surname, but his journey reflects a willingness to take calculated steps—shifting teams, adjusting focus, and balancing education with sport. Off the field, his recent engagement marks a new phase in his personal life. On the field, his career remains a work in progress, with each season offering another opportunity to define himself on his own terms.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future.

This incident, during Jr NTR's entry scene, prompted mixed reactions online, with some criticizing the dangerous behavior. Similar incidents occurred previously, such as during a 'Tiger 3' screening, raising alarms about safety enforcement in cinemas.  The release of 'War 2' sparked massive celebrations and fanfare among fans of actor Jr NTR, who plays a leading role in the Bollywood film. But while most of the celebrations involved fans throwing confetti showers in the theatres, coupled with cheering, dancing and cheering, one viral incident has raised serious safety concerns.The incident in question features a man lighting up a 'flame thrower' inside the theatre. The frenzy began with Jr NTR’s much-hyped entry scene where the superstar ‘flies’ onto the screen via a drone, landing shirtless on a ship and flaunting his chiselled eight-pack abs. As the crowd erupts, he is introduced on-screen as the “Man of the Masses.” While others in the audience threw confetti, applauded and whistled, one group of fans rushed to the front of the theatre and raised eyebrows with their unruly behaviour. Viral VideoIn the footage, a group of enthusiastic fans is seen dancing near the screen with posters, when one man appears to ignite what looks like a flamethrower. It remains unclear whether he used a lighter and deodorant spray to create the flame effect or if he actually brought a flamethrower to the theatre, but the stunt has raised alarm over the potential risk to fellow moviegoers.Safety ConcernsSocial media reactions have been mixed. While some brushed it off as part of the celebration, many netizens slammed the behaviour, pointing out the fire dangers. “This could have gone horribly wrong,” one user commented.Similar Past ReactionsThis is not the first time that Bollywood films have seen such celebrations turn hazardous. In 2023, Salman Khan fans made headlines for lighting fireworks inside a theatre during 'Tiger 3' screening at Mohan Cinema in Malegaon, Maharashtra. The incident, which included rockets and string bombs ignited in the front rows, caused panic among audiences and led to calls for stricter safety enforcement in cinemas. The viral video even prompted Salman to put out a tweet warning fans about the dangers of such actions.Box Office Performance'War 2' recorded a massive Rs 52.50 crore debut at the box office, and according to early estiamtes on Day 2, the film has added another Rs 8.33 crore to its kitty. This takes the Hrithik Roshan, Jr NTR and Kiara Advani starrer’s total earnings to Rs 60.83 crore in just two days.The film, which is part of YRF’s lucrative Spy Universe, has been drawing audiences with its high-octane action sequences and the first-time pairing of Hrithik and Jr NTR. While the Hindi version’s opening fell short of expectations, the Telugu dubbed version has emerged as a key contributor, powered by Jr NTR’s massive fan following in the South.With the Independence Day holiday driving higher footfalls across the country, trade analysts predict a strong upward trajectory for the weekend, with the potential to cross the Rs 100 crore mark. However, competition from Rajinikanth’s 'Coolie' in southern markets remains a factor to watch in the days ahead."Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Boosted by a strong Telugu dubbed version, which amassed Rs 23.25 crore, the film surpassed initial modest predictions. While the Hindi version contributed Rs 29 crore, it was the regional performance that propelled 'War 2' past the Rs 50 crore mark.  Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR’s spy-action thriller 'War 2' has surpassed expectations at the domestic box office, delivering an opening day collection of Rs 52.50 crore (early estimates) and catching up to Rajinikanth’s 'Coolie' in the race for top spot.War 2 Movie ReviewAdvance BookingsBefore release, advance booking trends suggested a modest start, with trade analysts predicting the film could record the lowest opening in YRF’s Spy Universe. Many expected it to debut around Rs 43 crore net, similar to Salman Khan’s 'Tiger 3', despite its large-scale production and star power.Hrithik Roshan calls Jr. NTR 'incredible' and his favorite co‑star for 'War 2'Hindi Box Office CollectionsHowever, the film surprised at the ticket counters, with the Hindi version contributing an estimated Rs 29 crore net on Day 1. While this figure is a marked improvement over advance ticket sales, it still falls short of several franchise entries, including 'Ek Tha Tiger' which earned an estimated Rs 32.93 crore way back in 2012. This makes it the lowest Hindi opener in YRF’s Spy Universe, while Shah Rukh Khan's 'Pathaan' occupies the top spot with a collection of Rs 55 crore.PollWhich version of 'War 2' do you think performed best at the box office?Hindi VersionTelugu Dubbed VersionTamil and Telugu CollectionsSignificantly, it was the Telugu dubbed version that boosted overall earnings, amassing an impressive Rs 23.25 crore net, driven largely by Jr NTR’s massive fan base. The Tamil version added a modest Rs 25 lakh. This strong regional performance helped War 2 comfortably cross the Rs 50 crore mark on opening day.Occupancy figures reflected this divide, Hindi shows recorded 29.24% occupancy on Thursday, while Tamil shows achieved a stronger 42.41%.War 2 Misses War recordWar 2 may have opened big, but it narrowly missed matching the benchmark set by its predecessor, 'War' (2019), which had stormed the box office with a record-breaking Rs 53 crore opening day. Despite boasting a bigger budget, scale, a multi-language release, and the added star power of Jr NTR alongside Hrithik , the sequel’s debut collection fell just short of surpassing the original's milestone. Interestingly, while the original netted a higher Hindi collection, this one relied heavily on the Telugu collections to hit the mark.Jr NTS' FandomFans of the latter actor have been praising his performance in the movie. Vijayawada NTR Fans District Association president Kavuri Krishna states that the movie 'War 2' has been released in theatres, and they hope NTR's action will secure great viewership across the world. Talking to ANI he expressed happiness over NTR's performance in this bilingual film and predicted that the movie would create records at the box office. Krishna said that NTR played a vital role in the film, portraying a character who protects India, and praised Director Mukerji for presenting NTR so well. "Hats off to Mukerji," he added.Baji, an NTR fan, said that NTR's character in the movie was "awesome," and thanked Director Mukerji for choosing Jr NTR for the role. He praised the actor's dance and fight sequences, saying, "The period before 'War 2' and after 'War 2' should be calculated separately for his career."Sunil, another NTR fan, said 'War 2' was an excellent film and that NTR has now dominated Bollywood with his performance.Early PredictionsIndustry estimates suggest the film’s total India gross for Day 1 could exceed Rs 60 crore once all language versions are included, with early gross estimates already touching Rs 65 crore.On the whole, the two films have amassed an estimated combined total of Rs 117.50 crore. Coolie Box Office CollectionsDespite its success, competition from 'Coolie' in the southern markets and mixed audience reception, praising action but critiquing pacing, may affect momentum. With the Independence Day holiday and weekend ahead, 'War 2' still has the potential to build on its strong start and improve its Hindi market performance.DISCLAIMER: The box office numbers in this article are compiled from our proprietary sources and diverse public data.

He passionately declared himself a proud Indian, urging the youth to prioritize unity and progress over division.  In a candid and emotional interview, Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan once spoke out about the pain of having his patriotism questioned, admitting he felt like crying over the need to defend his love for India. The 'Jawan' star, who has faced intense public scrutiny, declared himself the "proudest Indian in the world," urging the nation to rise above division and focus on progress. His powerful message resonated with many, highlighting the difference between genuine contribution and public performance.Let's take a closer look at this throwback moment.Shah Rukh Khan on the pain of having his patriotism questionedShah Rukh Khan, one of India’s most iconic stars, once opened up about the emotional toll of having his love for the country questioned. In an interview on Aap Ki Adalat, the Jawan star admitted, “Sometimes I feel very sad, I even feel like crying, that I should be made to say that I belong to this country, I am a patriot.” These remarks came during a period of intense public scrutiny, and his quiet dignity in the face of such adversity highlighted his firm belief that patriotism shouldn't be a competition.SRK on urging the youth to rise above divisionIn that heartfelt interview, SRK also directed a powerful message to the younger generation. He expressed his sadness at having to constantly explain his love for India and urged young people to focus on unity and progress. He called India "the greatest country in the world," highlighting its safety, beauty, and unity. For him, true patriotism lies in working hard and contributing to the nation's future, not in getting trapped in "small, petty matters" that divide the country. SRK said, “I get very sad when I have to explain each time how good a patriot I am,” he said. “I will tell all young people to be tolerant, be happy, work hard, and take this nation forward.” SRK on declaring his unshakable pride in IndiaThe superstar made it clear that no amount of public debate could shake his love for the country that made him who he is. "Whether my film is a hit or not, I want to say for the last time, there is no patriot greater than me in this country," he asserted. He added that no one has received more love from India than he has, and that he and his family will always work for its greatness, a sentiment that resonated deeply with his millions of fans.Work frontA few days ago, the 71st National Film Awards were announced, and Shah Rukh Khan bagged the Best Actor honour for 'Jawan'.

Abraham emphasizes the film's sensitivity in portraying Iran and Israel, aiming for balance and avoiding exaggerated action. He believes 'Tehran' is a significant Indian film, exploring diverse cultures and languages.  John Abraham, the Bollywood hunk, is known for bringing his ‘A’ game with every action thriller, and ‘Tehran’ is no exception. However, this time, he has walked an extra mile, as ‘Tehran’ is not your typical gun-blazing spectacle; this time, the high-stakes thriller spans countries, colours, and languages. “‘Tehran,’ I can confidently say, is one of the most significant and biggest international films out of India,” said John Abraham in his exclusive conversation with us.“We’ve spoken different languages, explored different cultures, and it’s been a fantastic experience,” added the actor.John Abraham reveals why he says no to bollywood parties—and yes to a 4 am wake-up callThe film is set primarily in Iran, and John Abraham has a personal connection to the country, as his mother has relatives there. When asked if his connection helped him to understand the subject matter better, the actor shared, “I believe Iran is arguably the most misrepresented country in the world.” John Abraham says the film has been crafted with sincerityHe continued, “Yes, of course, there’s a big question mark over the regime, but the people of Iran are beautiful—and that’s what I believe. We still have cousins there, and it’s a place I would want to visit. Naturally, I want to see a deeply balanced film. In our film, we’ve been very sensitive to how people feel about Iran, how people feel about Israel—especially since some of my closest friends are from Israel—and also how India is portrayed."Speaking on the subject of sensitivity, the actor also highlighted that to stay true to the movie, the team avoided any stylized or exaggerated action. “There was a temptation to go over the top, to add in those action sequences. But we steered clear of that and made the most honest film we could," concluded John Abraham.About ‘Tehran’Based on the 2012 attacks on Israeli diplomats, ‘Tehran’ is an Arun Gopalan directorial. Released on Zee5 on August 14, the movie stars John Abraham, Neeru Bajwa, and Manushi Chhillar in the lead roles.

Every man wants to have two wives in their life, but it doesn’t happen for most because they can’t handle the first one.”About The Legal DramaThe summons follows a petition filed by Davinder Rajput, who has alleged that Malik has entered into four marriages, in violation of the Hindu Marriage Act, which allows only one marriage at a time for individuals practising Hinduism.In addition to the bigamy allegations, the petition accuses Armaan and Payal Malik of hurting religious sentiments. It claims that Payal appeared dressed as the Hindu goddess Kali in an Instagram video, sparking outrage. The petitioner argues that this act was offensive to religious beliefs and constitutes a punishable offence under Indian law.Investigations into the allegations are ongoing."Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

He candidly discussed his divorce from Kristen Corley on a podcast, emphasizing their commitment to co-parenting their two daughters, Kensli and Marlie.  Chance the Rapper is gearing up to release his new album, Star Line, on August 15, 2025. In a recent interaction, he revealed details of his upcoming And We Back tour, set to kick off in September 2025 in support of the album. However, it’s not just his music making headlines. During an appearance on the New Rory & Mal podcast, the rapper also spoke candidly about his personal life and his divorce from Kristen Corley.Split after five years of marriageChance and Kristen parted ways in 2024 after being married for five years. He shared that he’s currently in a “transition” period and still learning and growing.Love and Family Bonds RemainDespite their split, Chance said they “definitely love each other.” Coming from a close-knit family, he believes it’s important for him, Kristen, and their families to stay connected and get along well.Separation from Kristen CorleyChance revealed that even though they’re separated, he and Kristen still travel together, but their relationship has a very different dynamic now.From deep love to divorceThe two first met at the age of nine and tied the knot in 2019. They have two daughters, Kensli (9) and Marlie (5). Chance and Kristen shared a strong bond, but five years into their marriage, they faced challenges they couldn’t overcome. This eventually led to what Chance describes as an “amicable” divorce.A Difficult JourneySpeaking on the New Rory & Mal podcast, Chance admitted, "I ain't gonna act like it’s not tough. I ain’t gonna act like it’s perfect and we shook hands and dipped. It’s weird. I think the toughness is that it’s a reality. I think that’s the toughest part. You might feel like you’re over it, and you’re not over it. Or you might be used to a certain pattern of operating, and because it doesn’t work like that, you have to allow yourself grace to deal with that and operate in reality."Mutual respectChance shared that he and Kristen maintain mutual respect, which allows them to keep a friendly relationship. They often visit the same places and see each other at least every other week. He noted that, unlike some separated couples who completely cut off contact.Connected through their kidsChance explained that having children means he and Kristen will always share an emotional connection. He compared it to a Venn diagram, where they are both linked through the same centre, their kids. While admitting they may not be the most emotionally mature people, he said they share the understanding that helps them avoid letting conflicts go too far. He added that he’s grateful to have a co-parent who shares this mindset.Chance The Rapper is such a family man!"Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

The test requires you to position your hands on your thighs while performing repeated palm flips upwards, then downwards, or to perform rapid thumb tapping between your fingers in sequence followed by sequence reversal  You do not (always) have to get an invasive test done to gauge the health of your brain. If you are otherwise healthy, some really simple home tests can also tell you if all is okay in the brain. Wondering how? Let's take a look...The RAM testThe Rapid Alternate Movement (RAM) test is a basic neurological examination, which evaluates the brain-muscle coordination needed to create smooth coordinated movements. The test targets the cerebellum, which functions as the control center for balance together with muscle coordination, and precise movement execution. During the RAM test, you need to perform quick hand flipping motions or finger tapping patterns. Difficulty with smooth and fast test performance can indicate problems in the brain or nervous system that result from cerebellar dysfunction, which often appears after injuries, strokes and brain-related medical conditions.What is the Rapid Alternate Movement testThe RAM test evaluates your capability to execute fast repetitive movements using your hands or feet. The examination sometimes goes by the name of dysdiadochokinesia assessment, because it tests rapid alternating movement abilities. The test requires you to position your hands on your thighs while performing repeated palm flips upwards, then downwards, or to perform rapid thumb tapping between your fingers in sequence followed by sequence reversal. The assessment evaluates how fluidly and rapidly you perform the movements. Slow, uncoordinated or clumsy movements during the test can suggest problems with the cerebellum. Doctors utilise this examination to evaluate brain operations and coordination, primarily focusing on the cerebellum.How to perform the RAM test at homeThe RAM test has a home version which helps you evaluate your motor skills and coordination abilities. Here’s how:Sit comfortably on a chair with your feet flat on the ground and your hands resting on your thighs.Place your hands flat on your thighs with the palms down.Perform quick hand movements by facing your palms up and then immediately facing them back down toward the bottom. Perform these movements as quickly and smoothly as possible for 10 seconds.The finger tapping version of the test requires you to touch your thumb tip to your index finger tip followed by middle finger tip then ring finger tip and pinky tip before repeating the sequence in reverse order. Execute these movements with maximum speed and fluidity for the entire 10 seconds.Test each hand separately before combining them into a single hand operation.Medical evaluation of your brain coordination centers becomes necessary when you experience either speed difficulties, or unsteady movements during the test.What does the RAM Test tell youThe RAM test functions as a brief assessment tool to evaluate motor coordination capabilities of your brain. Rapid alternating movement problems usually indicate cerebellum, or its connection pathway abnormalities. The conditions of stroke, brain injuries, multiple sclerosis and tumors that impact brain coordination, tend to cause this type of problem. The RAM test cannot diagnose diseases directly, but indicates that you should seek professional neurological evaluation if you experience any difficulty with the test, especially when combined with dizziness, imbalance or weakness.Limitations of the RAM TestThe RAM test functions as a single component within a complete neurological examination. The test fails to identify the specific nature of the issue, or its precise brain location. Your test performance can be influenced by stress together with tiredness, as well as nutritional deficiencies. However, the test cannot give any precise results on any condition.Sources:https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/nursingskills/chapter/6-8-assessing-cerebellar-function/https://med.stanford.edu/stanfordmedicine25/the25/cerebellar.htmlhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559262/Disclaimer: This article is informational only and not a substitute for medical adviceGet the latest lifestyle updates on Times of India, along with Happy Independence Day wishes, messages, and quotes !About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Making THESE changes in the diet can lower blood pressure
A recent study highlights the significant benefits of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables for individuals with hypertension. The research demonstrates that incorporating more fruits and vegetables into one's diet can effectively lower blood pressure, improve kidney health, and reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Unlike sodium bicarbonate, fruits and vegetables achieve these benefits while potentially reducing the need for medication.

A recent study highlights the significant benefits of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables for individuals with hypertension. The research demonstrates that incorporating more fruits and vegetables into one's diet can effectively lower blood pressure, improve kidney health, and reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Unlike sodium bicarbonate, fruits and vegetables achieve these benefits while potentially reducing the need for medication. High blood pressure, aka hypertension, affects about 1.28 billion adults (aged 30–79) globally. Among these, about 46% are unaware that this condition exists, according to the WHO. High blood pressure is a silent killer and could lead to chronic illnesses, such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Certain factors increase the risk of hypertension; however, some of them are in our control, and one is diet. A 2024 study found that making certain dietary changes can lower blood pressure and improve kidney and heart health. The findings of the five-year interventional randomized control trial are published in The American Journal of Medicine. Watch what you eatFocusing on a diet that is rich in fruits and vegetables is crucial in the treatment of hypertension patients, according to doctors. Despite efforts, hypertension-related chronic kidney disease and its cardiovascular mortality are increasing. Heart disease is the number one reason that patients with chronic kidney disease die.PollWhich factor do you think has the most significant impact on managing high blood pressure?Healthy diet (fruits & vegetables)MedicationSo what should you eat to lower blood pressure? DASH. Yes, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, is proven to lower blood pressure. This is a flexible and balanced eating plan, that is rich in fruits and vegetables. It is the recommended first-line treatment for primary hypertension. Despite scientific evidence, the DASH diet is under-prescribed and under-implemented.“As a nephrologist (kidney doctor), my acid-base laboratory studies ways by which the kidney removes acid from the blood and puts it into the urine. Our animal studies showed years ago that mechanisms used by the kidneys to remove acid from the blood can cause kidney injury if the animals were chronically (long-term) exposed to an acid-producing diet. Our patient studies showed similar findings: that is, an acid-producing diet (one high in animal products) was kidney-harmful, and one that is base-producing (one high in fruits and vegetables) is kidney-healthy. Other investigators showed that a diet high in fruits and vegetables is heart-healthy. We hypothesized that one way that fruits and vegetables are both kidney- and heart-healthy is that they reduce the amount of acid in the diet and therefore the amount of acid that kidneys have to remove from the body,” Donald E. Wesson, MD, MBA, lead investigator Department of Internal Medicine, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, said, in a statement.The study To test the hypothesis, they conducted a study with participants who had hypertension, but not diabetes, and very high levels of urine albumin excretion (macroalbuminuria). Those with macroalbuminuria have chronic kidney disease, a high risk for the worsening of their kidney disease with time, and a high risk to subsequently developing cardiovascular diseases. The trial took over a five-year period, where the 153 participants with hypertension were divided into three groups:Study participants added 2-4 cups of base-producing fruits and vegetables in addition to their usual daily food intakeStudy participants were prescribed NaHCO3 (acid-reducing sodium bicarbonate, which is common baking soda) tablets in two daily doses of 4-5 650 mg tabletsStudy participants receiving standard medical care from primary care cliniciansHow diet plays a crucial roleThe findings of the study confirmed that consumption of fruits and vegetables and NaHCO3 improved kidney health, but only fruits and vegetables, and not NaHCO3, reduced blood pressure and improved indices of cardiovascular disease risk.“Importantly, fruits and vegetables achieved the latter two benefits with lower doses of medication used to lower blood pressure and reduce cardiovascular disease risk. This means that one can get the kidney health benefits with either fruits and vegetables or NaHCO3, but we get the blood pressure reduction and reduced cardiovascular disease risk with fruits and vegetables, but not with NaHCO3. This supports our recommendation that fruits and vegetables should be ‘foundational’ treatment for patients with hypertension, because we accomplish all three goals (kidney health, lower blood pressure, and reduced cardiovascular disease risk) with fruits and vegetables, and we can do so with lower medication doses,” co-investigator Maninder Kahlon, PhD, Department of Population Health, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, explains.Low blood pressure got you down? Try these 4 home fixes!"Dietary interventions for chronic disease management are often not recommended and even less often executed because of the many challenges to get patients to implement them. Nevertheless, they are effective, and in this instance, kidney and cardiovascular protective.

Do BP readings differ between arms? Doctor explains what it means
Small blood pressure differences between arms are common, usually under 10 mmHg. However, a consistent difference exceeding 10-15 mmHg warrants medical consultation, potentially indicating artery narrowing or, rarely, aortic dissection. Doctors often check both arms to uncover hidden circulation issues, advising consistent use of the arm with higher readings for future measurements.

However, a consistent difference exceeding 10-15 mmHg warrants medical consultation, potentially indicating artery narrowing or, rarely, aortic dissection. Doctors often check both arms to uncover hidden circulation issues, advising consistent use of the arm with higher readings for future measurements.   You’re sitting in the doctor’s office, they slap the cuff on your right arm, pump it up, and read out your blood pressure. But then they decide to check the left arm too… and wait a minute the numbers don’t match. Cue the little voice in your head: Is something wrong?Let’s talk about why this happens, when it’s totally fine, and when it might be a sign to dig deeper.Yep, it’s normal… sometimesFirst, don’t panic. Small differences in blood pressure between your two arms are actually pretty common. In fact, for most healthy people, it’s normal to see a difference of up to 10 mmHg (that’s millimeters of mercury, the unit for BP).So if your right arm says 122/78 and your left says 128/80, you can probably relax, it’s likely just normal variation.When the difference could mean something moreNow, here’s the important bit, according to Harvard Health, if there’s a consistent difference of more than 10–15 mmHg between your arms, especially in the top (systolic) number, it’s worth talking to your doctor.Larger, ongoing differences can sometimes be linked to:Artery narrowing (Peripheral Artery Disease) – If one arm has a partially blocked artery, it can affect blood flow and pressure readings.Aortic dissection (rare, but serious) – This is a sudden tear in the aorta wall. It’s an emergency and comes with other severe symptoms like chest pain.Recently, Dr Sudhir Kumar took to X to explain this phenomenon. "1. Variation of systolic BP up to 10 mmHg and diastolic BP of up to 5 mmHg between two arms is normal. Always use the higher arm reading for recording. 2. If the inter-arm variation is greater than 15 mmHg, it is NOT normal- could be suggestive of a vascular disease- get evaluated by a doctor," he posted on X.Why doctors sometimes check both armsMedical pros know that arm-to-arm BP differences can reveal hidden circulation issues. That’s why many guidelines suggest measuring both arms at least once during checkups, especially for new patients or anyone at higher cardiovascular risk.If one arm consistently shows higher readings, your doctor might recommend using that arm for all future measurements to keep your numbers consistent.What you can do at homeIf you’ve got a blood pressure monitor at home (and honestly, they’re a great investment if you care about heart health), here’s how to check:Measure both arms – Sit quietly for 5 minutes, then check your BP on one arm, rest for a minute, and check the other.Keep a log – Write down your readings and any noticeable patterns.Talk to your doctor – If the difference is consistently over 10–15 mmHg, bring your log to your next appointment.A small difference in blood pressure between arms? Totally normal. But if you’re seeing a bigger, consistent gap, don’t ignore it—it could be your body’s way of flagging something important.Your arms might look the same on the outside, but the blood vessels inside could be telling two different stories. Checking both arms every once in a while is a simple, quick way to keep an eye on your circulation health.Next time a nurse or doctor checks your BP, you’ll know exactly why they sometimes switch sides. Not because they’re bored… but because your arms might be trying to tell them something.Get the latest lifestyle updates on Times of India, along with Happy Independence Day wishes, messages, and quotes !About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

They were traveling to Puerto Rico. ChatGPT gave them wrong travel advice. It said no visa was needed. But an ESTA was necessary. They missed this detail. The couple got stuck. Another man was hospitalized. He followed AI suggestions. Experts advise caution with AI.   Influencer couple Mery Caldass and Alejandro Cid were all set for what should’ve been a dreamy trip to Puerto Rico. But instead of basking in beach vibes, they ended up stuck in an airport, sobbing and blaming none other than ChatGPT for their nightmare.In a now-viral TikTok with over 13,000 views, as reported by New York Post, Mery with tears streaming, frustration loud and clearly explains that, “I always do tons of research, but I asked ChatGPT and it said no visa was needed.” Which, sure, sounds convenient. But unfortunately, that “advice” missed a tiny, yet crucial detail: while they didn’t need a visa for Puerto Rico, they did need something called an ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorization). It’s kind of like a quick online clearance that ChatGPT apparently forgot to mention.Unsurprisingly, the clip lit up the internet. A lot of people had words. Some were with the sarcasm, like commenting, “Natural selection, I guess,” mocking their decision to rely on ChatGPT for something important. Another quipped, “Who trusts ChatGPT for that kind of info?”On the flip side, a few folks defended the AI: maybe the couple just didn’t phrase their question properly, sure, they asked if they needed a visa, but they never asked whether an ESTA was necessary. What is ESTA?The ESTA, short for Electronic System for Travel Authorization, is basically an online permission slip. If you’re from one of the eligible countries, you don’t need a full visa, but you do need to fill out this quick online form before you travel. It’s not a visa interview or a mountain of paperwork, just an application you do online, pay a small fee for, and usually get approved within minutes (though they say apply at least 72 hours before your trip, just in case). Once approved, it’s valid for two years, and you can use it for multiple trips. Think of it as a “fast pass” but skip it, and you might end up like those influencers stuck at the airport instead of sipping piña coladas.Another ChatGPT mishapThis isn’t the only headline-grabbing ChatGPT slip-up lately. Other stories have spotlighted more concerning misadventures: one older guy ended up hospitalized with hallucinations after following AI-generated suggestions. Clearly, when it comes to AI, a healthy dose of skepticism and double-checking is a must.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousRubina Dilaik's powerful reality show lookstvIn pic: Radiant pictures of Pooja HegdeEntertainment5 human body parts we may no longer need in the futureLifestyleBollywood-approved ethnic sets that are perfect for Independence Day 2025Lifestyle10 Stunning ethnic looks of Megha Shettytv10 celeb-inspired Indian baby girl namesLifestyleOne's own enemy: 8 animals that get triggered by their own reflectionLifestyleIndependence Day 2025: 10 inspiring lines on Freedom that warm the heartLifestyleJanmashtami 2025: Ethnic Glam Lessons from Malavika MohananEntertainmentHow to build a balcony water garden with easy care stepsLifestyle Next123 Photostories  5 simple chia seed recipes that help in weight loss5 foods that can lower the chances of getting a strokeWhy Aarti has 5 flames: The deep meaning behind itIndia at 79: PM Modi leads Independence Day celebrations - In pics5 unique and must-have desserts made with eggsIndependence Day 2025: Bollywood actors who have portrayed freedom fightersDid you know Sameera Reddy was the first Indian actress to have her own video game?From forest to ice: 6 animals that vanish into their habitatFreedom Trails: Cities where India’s independence was forgedIndependence Day special: This Indian floral fabric threatened Europe’s textile industry123Tired of too many ads?go ad free nowlifestyle videos13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement16:34Life After 60: Why India's seniors are choosing community living04:34Control Your Senses, Gain Knowledge, Attain Peace: Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4.3906:37Cultural Clashes in Love: How To Make Your Relationship Work03:19Prayagraj MahaKumbh 2025 Readies For Millions: Massive Preparations Underway In Uttar Pradesh04:48Sadhguru Reveals The Truth About Black Magic And Your Photograph07:18BK Shivani On Forgiveness: Why It’s Essential For Inner Peace08:08How Bhairavi Sadhana Accelerates Your Path to Liberation: Sadhguru Speaks06:47Breakup Recovery: How To Not Wallow In Misery And Love Yourself03:20The Purifying Power of Yajna: Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4, Verse 3011:41How Dattatreya Accepted Parashuram as His Disciple – Sadhguru Reveals03:54Can Water Remember?

Opt for fabrics like georgette, chiffon, or cotton that flow beautifully and allow easy movement for dancing and festivities. Add a vibrant petticoat for extra volume, because more twirl means more charm.

Secure with a discreet pin to avoid mishaps. For ready-made skirts, choose one with a good flare to mimic that traditional Gopi silhouette.

Instead, tuck one end into your skirt at the waist, bring it diagonally across your torso, loop it behind your back, and drape it gracefully over the opposite shoulder. This gives a traditional yet flattering look, echoing classical temple styles.

Rich in antioxidants, it may lower blood pressure, support healthy blood fat levels, and promote liver health. Studies suggest it could aid weight loss, possess anti-cancer properties, and reduce bacterial growth, making it a flavorful and healthful addition to one's diet.  Hibiscus, a vibrant flowering plant, is widely known for its antioxidant-rich properties and potential health benefits. Most commonly consumed as hibiscus tea, it has been linked to weight loss, heart health, liver support, antibacterial activity, and even cancer prevention. With a tart, cranberry-like flavor, hibiscus tea can be enjoyed hot or cold and is made by steeping the dried flowers or extracts in boiling water. Among the many species, Hibiscus sabdariffa is the most popular for tea preparation. This article explores eight key benefits of hibiscus, including its nutritional properties, impact on chronic diseases, and tips for making and enjoying hibiscus tea.5 Things that show you have a healthy heartBenefits of consuming Hibiscus teaRich in antioxidantsHibiscus is packed with antioxidants, which are compounds that neutralize harmful free radicals in the body. Free radicals can cause cell damage, inflammation, and contribute to chronic diseases. As per the study published in PubMed, people with Marfan syndrome reported that hibiscus extract improved blood antioxidant levels.Animal research also demonstrated protection against cellular damage.Human and animal studies have shown that hibiscus extract increases antioxidant levels and reduces oxidative stress.May lower blood pressureOne of the most well-known benefits of hibiscus tea is its potential to reduce high blood pressure, a key risk factor for heart disease. Studies have shown that hibiscus tea may lower both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. A study with 46 participants found that consuming hibiscus tea for one month significantly reduced blood pressure compared to a placebo. As per the study published in PubMed, the health benefits of consuming hibiscus tea may help you prevent various heart issues and control blood pressure. Caution: People taking blood pressure medications should consult a doctor before consuming hibiscus tea to avoid interactions.Supports healthy blood fat levelsHibiscus tea may also improve cholesterol and triglyceride levels, which are critical for heart health. In diabetic participants, hibiscus tea increased HDL (good) cholesterol and reduced LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides.Some studies in people with metabolic syndrome showed similar results, though research in healthy populations is limited.Conflicting evidence exists, so more large-scale studies are needed.Promotes liver healthThe liver performs essential functions, including fat metabolism, protein synthesis, and detoxification. Hibiscus may support liver function by:Reducing liver fat accumulation (steatosis) in overweight individuals.Protecting liver cells from damage in animal studies.Improving markers of fatty liver disease in high-fat diet animal models.According to various studies, hibiscus tea is involved in supporting liver function. May aid weight lossHibiscus tea may support weight management and fat reduction:Studies with overweight participants consuming hibiscus extract reported decreases in body weight, body fat, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio.Animal studies suggest hibiscus may reduce fat accumulation and suppress appetite.Potential anti-cancer propertiesHibiscus is rich in polyphenols, compounds known for anticancer activity:Test-tube studies show hibiscus extract can inhibit the growth and spread of cancer cells, including breast, prostate, mouth, and skin cancers. These studies involve concentrated extracts, not the tea form, so human effects remain unproven.May reduce bacterial growthHibiscus may help combat harmful bacteria:Test-tube studies show hibiscus extract inhibits strains like E. coli, and other bacteria linked to infections such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections.Extracts have shown activity comparable to certain antibiotics in lab studies.How to prepare hibiscus tea and deliciousHibiscus tea is simple to make and enjoyable:Add dried hibiscus flowers to boiling water, steep for 5 minutes, strain, and optionally sweeten with honey or lime juice. It can be served hot or cold, offering a tart, cranberry-like flavour.Dried hibiscus is widely available in health stores and online, and tea bags provide a convenient alternative.How to add hibiscus tea into your dietHibiscus tea is simple to make and enjoyable:Preparation: Add dried hibiscus flowers to boiling water, steep for 5 minutes, strain, and optionally sweeten with honey or lime juice.Serving: It can be served hot or cold, offering a tart, cranberry-like flavor.Availability: Dried hibiscus is widely available in health stores and online, and tea bags provide a convenient alternative.Disclaimer: The information provided is for educational purposes only.

4 powerful food pairings to maximize nutrition
Enhance your nutrient absorption and gut health by pairing specific foods. Combining spinach with citrus boosts iron bioavailability, while tomatoes and olive oil maximize lycopene absorption.

Combining spinach with citrus boosts iron bioavailability, while tomatoes and olive oil maximize lycopene absorption. Garlic and honey preserve allicin's benefits, and turmeric with black pepper dramatically increases curcumin absorption, optimizing your diet's nutritional value.  Your health and wellness start with what you eat. Eating healthy is, however, not just about what you eat, but how you eat. While diet plays a crucial role in your well-being, the way you combine, prepare, and enjoy it is of paramount importance. Pairing certain foods with others can boost nutrition. Dr. Will Bulsiewicz, a leading gastroenterologist and gut health expert, has shared four powerful food pairings that will help you absorb more nutrients and improve gut health. Let’s take a look. Beat belly fat with millets: Easy breakfast ideas for quick weight lossSpinach and citrusSpinach, as we all know, is an excellent source of iron. But spinach has non-heme iron, which is a form of iron that the body cannot absorb efficiently when compared to heme iron from animal sources. So how do you increase its bioavailability? Dr. Bulsiewicz suggests adding citrus to it. “When you add a source of vitamin C to spinach, like a squeeze of lemon or some orange segments, it transforms the iron in spinach into a more bioavailable form, helping boost your energy and prevent iron deficiency,” the gut doctor explains.Tomatoes and olive oilEver wondered why your Nonna Pia adds olive oil to sauté the tomatoes? Well, it's more than just amping up the flavour. The generational knowledge passed down to her is rooted in science! Tomatoes contain lycopene, which is a fat-soluble antioxidant compound that reduces the risk of heart disease by slashing oxidative stress. “But it's not that easy to absorb until you combine it with extra virgin olive oil. The fat from the extra virgin olive oil actually helps you to get more of the lycopene from the tomatoes,” the doctor adds. Danielle Spencer’s Final Days: Her Mother Speaks on Her Gastric Cancer Battle | WATCHGarlic and honeyCombining honey with garlic may not appear very appetizing, but this pairing has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. “Garlic has these sulfur-containing compounds called allicin. Allicin is so good for us. But the problem is, it breaks down very quickly,” Dr. Bulsiewicz says. The best way to preserve the benefits of garlic is to add honey to it. “If you add raw honey, it can actually help to preserve the allicin while also offering its own benefits for your immune system and your gut health,” the doctor reveals. Turmeric and black pepperTurmeric and black pepper are indeed a match made in heaven! Turmeric contains a compound called curcumin, which has anti-inflammatory properties. However, it’s poorly absorbed on its own. “Turmeric is a wonderful spice and curry that has these powerful anti-inflammatory polyphenols called curcumin. The problem is, curcumin is not absorbed very easily. But what you could do is combine this with black pepper, which has piperine,” the doctor says. When you add black pepper to turmeric, its bioavailability increases by up to 2,000%. Yes, that’s indeed a dramatic boost. “These combinations aren’t gimmicks. They’re simple, evidence-based strategies to help you get more from the foods you already enjoy,” he adds.

Your brain are unable to get oxygen and nutrients they need from blood, and start to die within a few minutes. This can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death. Stroke can be caused by a variety of factors including High Blood Pressure, smoking, diabetes, and poor diet. However, certain foods provide cardiovascular benefits which help decrease blood pressure while fighting inflammation. The following five foods can decrease your chances of experiencing a stroke.... Take a look...2/6Leafy green vegetablesLeafy greens consisting of spinach, kale, collard greens etc provide brain and heart protection through their essential nutritional value. Your body transforms dietary nitrates from leafy greens into the beneficial compound nitric oxide. The production of nitric oxide results in blood vessel relaxation and expansion, which enhances blood flow while decreasing blood pressure levels. Stroke prevention becomes more likely through the consumption of leafy greens because high blood pressure remains a significant risk factor for stroke. The nutritional elements in these vegetables help protect blood vessels through their vitamin content and antioxidant properties, which fight dangerous molecules in the body. A person who consumes one cup of leafy greens each day will experience decreased chances of developing ischemic stroke, that occurs because of clots obstructing brain blood flow.3/6Walnuts and other nutsThe heart and brain benefits of walnuts, stem from their content of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) which belongs to the omega-3 fatty acid family. Omega-3s in the body create anti-inflammatory effects, which enhance blood circulation and decrease blood pressure levels to minimise stroke occurrence. Walnuts contain protective antioxidants which shield the body from oxidative stress, by protecting its cells and blood vessels. Scientific research indicates walnuts consumed on a regular basis, help decrease both heart disease and stroke risks. Daily consumption of a handful of walnuts along with almonds and flaxseeds, maintains your vascular system.4/6Citrus fruitsVitamin C along with potassium and flavonoids from citrus fruits like oranges, grapefruits and lemons, provide antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The nutrients in these foods work to preserve healthy blood vessels while decreasing inflammation, which leads to damage and blockages. Studies prove that eating citrus fruits regularly decreases stroke risk through improved blood vessel function, together with lowered blood pressure. Eating different citrus fruits each day through natural juice consumption provides these health benefits.5/6Fatty FishSalmon, mackerel, trout and fresh tuna among other fatty fish varieties are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. The healthy fats in these foods decrease blood pressure, while simultaneously fighting inflammation and improving cholesterol numbers through increased good HDL cholesterol and decreased bad LDL cholesterol. These beneficial outcomes decrease the probability of blood clots that block brain blood flow. Medical professionals advise patients to consume fatty fish twice to three times weekly, to prevent stroke. You can prepare these fish by grilling or baking them, and using them in salads and pasta dishes.6/6Yogurt and low-fat dairy productsYogurt, alongside other low-fat dairy products supply the body with calcium, potassium, protein and vitamin D. The body maintains healthy blood pressure through potassium, which regulates sodium levels. Healthy blood vessels together with strong bones, receive support from calcium and vitamin D. Selecting low-fat or non-fat dairy alternatives instead of full-fat versions, enables people to minimise their intake of saturated fat and cholesterol, which can negatively impact heart health. Research indicates that regular yogurt consumption leads to lower probabilities of developing stroke and heart disease. Yogurt serves as a snack that can be combined with fresh fruit and whole grains during breakfast time.Sourceshttps://www.healthline.com/health/stroke/foods-that-prevent-strokehttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6047334/https://continentalhospitals.com/blog/10-foods-to-add-to-your-diet-that-help-prevent-stroke/https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/8-things-you-can-do-to-prevent-a-strokehttps://www.geisinger.org/health-and-wellness/wellness-articles/2018/05/08/13/47/these-brain-foods-could-cut-your-risk-of-strokeDisclaimer: This article is informational only and not a substitute for medical adviceFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous10 must-try South Indian Paneer dishesFood5 early signs that one's nervous system is breaking downindiaSonnalli Seygall radiates elegance in a graceful saree look that turns headsindiaIn pic: Radiant pictures of Pooja Hegdeindia5 human body parts we may no longer need in the futureindia10 Stunning ethnic looks of Megha ShettyindiaBollywood-approved ethnic sets that are perfect for Independence Day 2025india10 celeb-inspired Indian baby girl namesindiaIndependence Day 2025: 10 inspiring lines on Freedom that warm the heartindia Next123 Photostories  Countries that also celebrate Independence Day on August 15105+ Happy Independence Day messages, greetings, wishes and quotes for 20255 reasons why most Gen-Z travellers in India are opting for offbeat getaways5 unique and must-have desserts made with eggsFrom forest to ice: 6 animals that vanish into their habitatDid you know Sameera Reddy was the first Indian actress to have her own video game?Freedom Trails: Cities where India’s independence was forgedFAFO parenting: 7 facts about the new parenting trendIndependence Day special: This Indian floral fabric threatened Europe’s textile industry123lifestyle videos13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement16:34Life After 60: Why India's seniors are choosing community living04:34Control Your Senses, Gain Knowledge, Attain Peace: Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4.3906:37Cultural Clashes in Love: How To Make Your Relationship Work03:19Prayagraj MahaKumbh 2025 Readies For Millions: Massive Preparations Underway In Uttar Pradesh04:48Sadhguru Reveals The Truth About Black Magic And Your Photograph07:18BK Shivani On Forgiveness: Why It’s Essential For Inner Peace08:08How Bhairavi Sadhana Accelerates Your Path to Liberation: Sadhguru Speaks06:47Breakup Recovery: How To Not Wallow In Misery And Love Yourself03:20The Purifying Power of Yajna: Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4, Verse 3011:41How Dattatreya Accepted Parashuram as His Disciple – Sadhguru Reveals03:54Can Water Remember?

A teenage mother, Jacklyn's resilience and love shaped Bezos' life and career, including her early investment in Amazon. She co-founded the Bezos Family Foundation, dedicated to education and philanthropy, leaving a lasting legacy of compassion and support. Source: USA Today Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos shared a heartfelt tribute following the passing of his mother, Jacklyn Gise Bezos, at the age of 78. Known for her resilience, generosity, and unwavering dedication to family, Jacklyn played a pivotal role in shaping Bezos’ personal and professional journey. She became a mother at just 17, raising her children with love and determination, and later supported Jeff’s entrepreneurial ambitions, including early investments in Amazon. Beyond her family, Jacklyn devoted herself to philanthropy and education, co-founding the Bezos Family Foundation and initiatives like Vroom and the Bezos Scholars Program, leaving a lasting impact on countless lives. Her legacy of love, perseverance, and service continues to inspire.Jeff Bezos No Longer World’s Second-Richest!Jeff Bezos pays emotional tribute to mother Jacklyn Gise Bezos battling Lewy Body DementiaJeff Bezos took to Instagram to announce the passing of his mother, describing the circumstances with heartfelt detail. Jacklyn Bezos had been battling Lewy Body Dementia, a progressive neurological disorder, since 2020.In his emotional tribute, Bezos wrote:"After a long fight with Lewy Body Dementia, she passed away today, surrounded by so many of us who loved her — her kids, grandkids, and my dad. I know she felt our love in those final moments. We were also lucky to be in her life. I hold her safe in my heart forever."Through these words, Bezos captured both the pain of loss and the enduring love he felt for his mother. He emphasized her extraordinary capacity to give selflessly and care for others, a trait that deeply influenced his personal and professional life.Jacklyn Gise Bezos’ journey as a teenage mother shaping Jeff Bezos’ lifeJacklyn Gise Bezos became a mother at just 17 years old, giving birth to Jeff Bezos while still a high school student in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Raising a child as a teenager presented immense challenges, yet she embraced motherhood with determination and strength. "That couldn't have been easy, but she made it all work," Bezos reflected in his tribute.Jacklyn’s early motherhood required balancing personal ambitions with the responsibilities of raising a child. Her resilience and dedication became a model of unconditional love, teaching her children the value of perseverance, compassion, and loyalty.How Jacklyn Gise Bezos and Miguel Bezos nurtured a strong blended familyWhen Jeff was four, Jacklyn married Miguel Bezos, a Cuban immigrant who later adopted Jeff. The blended family created a nurturing environment that allowed Jeff to grow up with a strong sense of love and support. Interestingly, Jeff only learned the truth about his biological father when he was 10 years old, which highlights the complexity and strength of family bonds nurtured by Jacklyn.Bezos often praised his mother for her ferocious love and commitment:"She pounced on the job of loving me with ferocity, brought my amazing dad onto the team a few years later, and then added my sister and brother to her list of people to love, guard, and nourish."Her love extended not only to her immediate family but to anyone she could support, reflecting her innate generosity and nurturing spirit. Jacklyn and Miguel Bezos were not just devoted parents; they were early investors in Amazon, contributing over $245,000 in 1995, a decision that could have grown into billions in today’s market. This early support played a crucial role in Jeff Bezos’ confidence to pursue ambitious ventures."When you have loving and supportive people in your life, you end up being able to take risks because you kind of know somebody's got your back," he told Mathias Döpfner in 2018.This combination of emotional support and financial belief illustrates how Jacklyn’s influence extended beyond the personal realm, directly impacting one of the most significant entrepreneurial journeys in modern history.Jeff Bezos also celebrated his mother publicly through Blue Origin, his aerospace company. In 2020, he named a rocket recovery ship after her:"New Glenn's first stage will come home to the Jacklyn after every flight. It couldn't be more appropriately named — Mom has always given us the best place and best heart to come home to." This act symbolised the safe, nurturing environment she provided—a home base of love and support that enabled her children to pursue extraordinary ambitions.Jacklyn Gise Bezos’ lifelong commitment to education and philanthropyJacklyn Gise Bezos was a lifelong advocate for education. Despite early obstacles due to teenage pregnancy, she persisted and graduated from high school, later earning a Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology at the age of 45. Her dedication to learning served as an inspiration for her children and countless others.In 2000, Jacklyn and Miguel co-founded the Bezos Family Foundation, through which she focused on several initiatives:Vroom: A program distributing research-based tools to support early brain development in children.Bezos Scholars Program: Empowering students across the United States and Africa with educational opportunities and leadership training.Her philanthropic work demonstrates a lifelong commitment to uplifting communities, fostering learning, and investing in the potential of future generations.Get the latest lifestyle updates on Times of India, along with Happy Independence Day wishes, messages, and quotes !About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

THESE foods and beverages can starve cancer
Dr. William Li highlights the significance of dietary choices in cancer prevention, emphasizing that certain foods can starve cancer cells.

Incorporating these foods into the diet may lower the risk of developing various cancers, including colorectal cancer. Dr. William Li highlights the significance of dietary choices in cancer prevention, emphasizing that certain foods can starve cancer cells. Coffee, tea, Brassica vegetables, beans, legumes, and omega-3-rich seafood are recommended for their anti-inflammatory and blood supply-cutting properties. Incorporating these foods into the diet may lower the risk of developing various cancers, including colorectal cancer. Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. In 2020, cancer led to nearly 10 million deaths, which is one in six deaths, according to the World Health Organisation. While several factors increase the risk of cancer, the WHO says, 30% and 50% of cancers are preventable. One lifestyle change that can reduce the risk of cancer, is eating the right foods. Dr. William Li is a world-renowned physician and author known for revolutionary theories of disease prevention through the power of eating right, has shared a list of foods that can starve cancer. Take a look. Want to live longer? Science says eating more protein might be the answerAdd coffee and tea to the menu Yes, that’s right, popular beverages, coffee and tea, do more than just wake you up. Coffee contains chlorogenic acid, which lowers inflammation and starves the cancer cells. Tea, especially green tea, contains polyphenols called catechins, which, according to Dr. Li, cut off the blood supply to cancer. “For example, the Shanghai Women’s Health Study followed 69,000 women and found that those who drank tea at least 3 times per week had a 37% reduction in the risk for colon cancer, compared to women who didn’t drink green tea. How you steep your tea can make a difference. The more you steep, the more natural cancer-fighting substances from the tea leaves are released into your cup!” Dr. Li said in his blog. Brassica vegetablesLoad your plate with vegetables from the Brassica genus within the Brassicaceae family. According to Dr. Li, Brassica vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, kale, and arugula are potent cancer-fighting foods. These vegetables contain isothiocyanates, specifically sulforaphanes, which are natural chemicals that can cut off the blood supply feeding cancer and also lower inflammation.Eat your beansDr. Li also stressed the importance of adding beans and legumes to your diet. They are an excellent way to starve cancer cells. Beans and legumes, such as white beans, black beans, pinto beans, chickpeas, soybeans and edamame, are rich in dietary fiber, which has been linked to a lower risk of colorectal cancer.Omega-3s for the winImagine eating delectable fish recipes to beat cancer. Sounds like a dream, right? Dr. Li emphasizes the importance of adding seafood to the diet. Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, seafood is linked to lower inflammation. “We used to think it was only salmon or lower on the food chain like anchovies and sardines, mackerel, but in fact, even cod and halibut and even shrimp and shellfish like mussels and clams, they also have healthy omega-3s,” he said. “All of this can contribute to lowering your risk of developing cancers, including colorectal cancer,” he adds.

Those also lower inflammation and have cancer-starving properties as well,” he said.

She became a mother at 17 and raised Jeff, later building a close-knit family with her husband, Miguel "Mike" Bezos.  Jacklyn “Jackie” Gise Bezos, matriarch of the Bezos family and Jeff Bezos's loving mum, passed away on August 14, 2025, at the age of 78. She died peacefully at her home in Miami, surrounded by family, after a long, courageous fight with Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) that she’d been battling since 2020.Jackie’s journey into motherhood began early—she became a mum at just 17, giving birth to Jeff in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Despite all odds, she raised him on her own after her first marriage ended, and later married Miguel “Mike” Bezos in 1968, who became not just her partner but also Jeff’s adoptive dad. Together they built a close-knit family that included Jeff’s siblings Christina and Mark.Jeff Bezos No Longer World’s Second-Richest!Heartfelt tributeJeff has posted a heartfelt tribute on social media for his mother. "Her adulthood started a little bit early when she became my mom at the tender age of 17. That couldn’t have been easy, but she made it all work. She pounced on the job of loving me with ferocity, brought my amazing dad onto the team a few years later, and then added my sister and brother to her list of people to love, guard, and nourish. For the rest of her life, that list of people to love never stopped growing. She always gave so much more than she ever asked for," he writes. "After a long fight with Lewy Body Dementia, she passed away today, surrounded by so many of us who loved her — her kids, grandkids, and my dad. I know she felt our love in those final moments. We were all so lucky to be in her life. I hold her safe in my heart forever," he adds.Lewy Body Dementia: What is it?Lewy Body Dementia is a brain disorder that slowly chips away at a person’s memory, thinking skills, movement, and even mood. It’s actually the second most common type of progressive dementia after Alzheimer’s, but it often flies under the radar because its symptoms can look like a mix of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.The “Lewy bodies” in the name are tiny, abnormal protein clumps (called alpha-synuclein) that build up in brain cells. Imagine little unwanted “globs” in your brain’s control center—messing with how your neurons talk to each other. Over time, these globs cause brain cells to stop working properly and eventually die off.LBD can feel like a moving target. Symptoms often change from day to day, or even within the same day. Some of the most common signs are:Memory & thinking problems – kind of like Alzheimer’s, but sometimes less obvious in the very beginning.Hallucinations – people may see things that aren’t there, and these can be vivid and detailed.Movement issues – slow walking, stiffness, tremors—very Parkinson’s-like.Sleep changes – one common thing is “acting out” dreams (called REM sleep behavior disorder), where people physically move or talk in their sleep.Alertness swings – one hour someone might be sharp and chatty, and the next they seem confused or out of it.Because it blends symptoms from different brain disorders, LBD is often misdiagnosed—and getting the right diagnosis is key for proper care.Right now, there’s no cure for Lewy Body Dementia. Doctors can help manage symptoms with a mix of medications, lifestyle adjustments, and support therapies (like physical or occupational therapy). But here’s the kicker—some common Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s drugs can actually make certain LBD symptoms worse, so treatment has to be extra carefully managed. It usually shows up in people over 50 (most often in their 70s or 80s), and both men and women can get it. It’s not rare—experts estimate it affects about 1.4 million people in the US alone, and similar rates in Canada and the UK.Jackie was diagnosed in 2020 and faced the disease head-on with dignity and courage—having her devoted husband Mike by her side at every step.She was a real-life superstar—raising kids, going back to school in her mid-40s to earn a psychology degree, all while working and juggling life’s curveballs. Her fierce spirit didn’t stop there—Jackie helped launch Amazon in 1995 with a game-changing early investment (around $245–250 k), a move that would go on to shape history.On top of that, her heart for others ran deep. In 2000, she co-founded the Bezos Family Foundation, championing initiatives like Vroom (brain-science-based parenting tools) and the Bezos Scholars Program (supporting youth both in North America and Africa). Her dedication to education, empathy, and community was palpable every step of the way.Her philanthropic impact reached even further—Jackie and Mike backed groundbreaking immunotherapy cancer research through partnerships with Seattle’s Fred Hutch Cancer Center, including a massive $710 million gift in 2022 that was one of the largest donations the center had ever seen.Jacklyn “Jackie” Gise Bezos lived a life that was nothing short of extraordinary. She was a trailblazer, a nurturer, a lifelong learner, and a visionary who invested not just in her son’s dreams but also in the futures of countless others. Her fierce love for family, coupled with her tireless work in education and healthcare, leaves an imprint that will last for generations.Get the latest lifestyle updates on Times of India, along with Happy Independence Day wishes, messages, and quotes !About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

4 effective ways to lower cholesterol naturally
Managing cholesterol is vital for heart health. Limiting trans fats found in processed foods and incorporating monounsaturated fats from avocados, olive oil, and nuts can help. Regular exercise, aiming for at least 150 minutes of moderate activity weekly, is also crucial. Maintaining a healthy weight through diet and exercise further supports healthy cholesterol levels.

Limiting trans fats found in processed foods and incorporating monounsaturated fats from avocados, olive oil, and nuts can help. Regular exercise, aiming for at least 150 minutes of moderate activity weekly, is also crucial. Maintaining a healthy weight through diet and exercise further supports healthy cholesterol levels.  High cholesterol is a condition in which you have too much of a fatty substance called cholesterol in your blood. Elevated levels of LDL 'bad' cholesterol increase the risk of buildup of plaque in arteries, which can lead to heart disease and stroke. Keeping the cholesterol levels in check is crucial. Though medications can help, taking certain steps at home can help manage cholesterol levels. Take a look. Beat belly fat with millets: Easy breakfast ideas for quick weight lossKeep trans fat at bayTrans fats, also known as trans unsaturated fatty acids, are unsaturated fats that naturally occur in foods or are modified by a process called hydrogenation. It is an unhealthy fat found in processed foods, fried items, and baked goods. Consuming this trans fat will elevate the bad cholesterol and lower your good cholesterol (HDL). How to keep them at bay? Avoid foods like margarine, pastries, baked goods, some microwaveable popcorn, fried fast food, pizzas, and nondairy coffee creamer.Say ‘Yes’ to monounsaturated fatsNot all fats are the same. One of the best ways to lower cholesterol is to incorporate more monounsaturated fats in your diet. Think of eating avocados, olive oil, nuts such as almonds, cashews, and pecans, and olives. These are healthy fats that can lower bad cholesterol and also reduce your risk of heart disease. A 2022 study has found that eating one avocado a day for six months can reduce unhealthy cholesterol levels. They found that consuming avocados daily resulted in total cholesterol decreasing 2.9 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) and LDL cholesterol decreasing 2.5 mg/dL.Exercise regularlyStaying active is essential in keeping cholesterol levels in check. Regular exercise is an effective way to improve cholesterol levels. Studies have consistently shown that physical activity helps raise HDL while lowering LDL and triglycerides. Aim to get at least 150 minutes of moderate to intense aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous activity in a week. This could be walking, swimming, jogging, or cycling. You can also engage in intense physical activity such as HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training). Adjust your exercise intensity based on your health and fitness levels. Maintain a healthy weightIt is important to maintain a healthy weight. This is not about fitting into a conventional beauty standard, but being healthy. Obesity can negatively affect cholesterol levels. Studies have consistently shown that overweight and obesity raise levels of LDL ‘bad’ cholesterol. Even losing 5 to 10 percent of body weight can significantly lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Focus on eating a well-balanced and nutritious diet, along with exercise, to maintain a healthy weight.

Dr. Saurabh Sethi highlights early detection. Brittle nails indicate protein or iron issues. Eyelid twitching suggests magnesium deficiency. Clicking joints may warn of vitamin D3 or calcium shortage. Premature graying links to vitamin B12 or copper problems. Easy bruising signals vitamin C or K1 deficiency. Addressing these signs prevents bigger health problems.  The human body signals nutrient deficiencies. Dr. Saurabh Sethi highlights early detection. Brittle nails indicate protein or iron issues. Eyelid twitching suggests magnesium deficiency. Clicking joints may warn of vitamin D3 or calcium shortage. Premature graying links to vitamin B12 or copper problems. Easy bruising signals vitamin C or K1 deficiency. Addressing these signs prevents bigger health problems.  The human body is more miraculous than we understand. When an illness or deficiency sneaks in, it gives you signs. These signs appear even before they show up in the lab tests. Your body needs essential vitamins and minerals to function properly. But when it falls short, the body sends signals. These signs could be subtle and easy to dismiss. Dr. Saurabh Sethi, a California-based gastroenterologist, has now emphasized the importance of catching these signs early and correcting them before they lead to bigger health issues.Brittle nailsIf someone has a problem with breaking nails or strange ridges, the body might be craving protein or iron. Protein is essential for nail strength, and iron helps carry oxygen to the nail beds. Low iron levels can leave the nails weak and pale. Time to load up on eggs, spinach, nuts, and lean meats!  How strong are your nails? Well, not the fake ones, your real ones. Well, the strength of your nails can really tell a lot about your health. Dr. Sethi notes that brittle nails are a sign of protein and iron deficiency in your diet. If your nails are breaking very often and are thin, it is important to look into it. Iron plays a crucial role in helping deliver oxygen to cells. Protein, on the other hand, is the building block for keratin, the main component of nails. Eyelids or lid twitchingFrequent muscle cramps, especially in the legs, can be another indicator of kidney disease. This happens due to: Imbalances in key minerals like calcium, phosphorus, and potassium. Poor regulation of electrolytes by the kidneys, leading to sudden cramps and muscle pain.While dehydration can also cause cramps, persistent muscle spasms might suggest an underlying kidney issue.If you complain about a sudden spasm in your leg, it could be more than fatigue. A lack of adequate magnesium in your body can lead to muscle twitches. Similarly, the involuntary eyelid twitching is also a sign of magnesium deficiency. Magnesium has a pivotal role in transmitting nerve impulses and supporting muscle function.Clicking sound at the joints Do you hear a clicking sound from your knees when you sit or rise from a seated position? Well, it is not nothing. Dr. Sethi says that this could be a warning sign of vitamin D3 or calcium deficiency. These nutrients are essential for bone density and joint health. A deficiency can cause this audible sound in the joints.Premature grayingAre you struggling with premature graying? Well, genetics does play a major role in hair colour, however, early graying may also be linked to nutrient deficiencies. Dr. Sethi explains that premature graying could be due to vitamin B12 or copper deficiency. “Vitamin B12 is crucial for RBC production and oxygen transport at the hair follicles. This could also be a sign of copper deficiency, which is responsible for melanin production, imparting color to your hair,” he adds. Nutrient Power: How Vitamins Affect Hair Growth, Skin, and Nail HealthEasy bruisingDo you get hurt very easily? If you notice bruises very often on your body, it is a crucial sign of nutrient deficiency. This is a sign that your body may be low in vitamin C or vitamin K1. Vitamin C is responsible for collagen formation, which keeps blood vessels strong, while vitamin K1 plays a key role in blood clotting.Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

Consider natural supplements. Creatine enhances strength. Betaine improves endurance. Carnitine aids energy production and recovery. BCAAs prevent muscle breakdown. Whey protein supports muscle repair and growth. These supplements, combined with training and diet, can give you an edge. Always consult a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement.  When it comes to building muscle and speeding up recovery, most people focus on training programs and diet plans. But certain naturally occurring compounds, many of which are already present in foods and in your body, can give your fitness progress an extra edge. While these supplements are often manufactured in labs for convenience and purity, they are chemically identical to what occurs in nature. Backed by strong research, they can improve strength, endurance, recovery, and overall performance when combined with consistent training, proper nutrition, and adequate rest. Here are five of the most effective natural supplements to consider for maximizing results safely.1. Creatine Creatine is one of the most researched and effective supplements for enhancing strength and performance. It occurs naturally in foods such as chicken and certain types of fish like salmon, tuna, and cod. The body also produces small amounts from amino acids. Studies highlight Creatine’s main role is to replenish ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the primary energy currency your muscles use for short bursts of high-intensity activity such as sprinting, heavy lifting, or explosive movements. Supplementing with creatine monohydrate has been shown to increase muscle strength, improve workout capacity, and promote lean muscle growth over time. It can also help muscles store more water, giving them a fuller look and potentially aiding recovery.2. BetaineBetaine, also known as trimethylglycine, is found naturally in beets, spinach, quinoa, sweet potatoes, wheat bran, and shellfish. It plays a key role in methylation, a biochemical process important for muscle function and protein synthesis. Studies suggest betaine can improve muscle endurance, hydration, and overall power output during training. Its osmolyte properties help cells maintain fluid balance under stress, which is particularly useful during long or intense workouts. Athletes who supplement with betaine may notice improvements in performance metrics like sprint speed, rep volume, and reduced fatigue between sets.3. CarnitineCarnitine is a compound involved in transporting fatty acids into your cells’ mitochondria, where they are burned for energy. It’s naturally abundant in red meat, poultry, dairy, avocado, asparagus, and whole milk. While your body synthesizes it from lysine and methionine (two amino acids), supplementing can help optimize energy production, especially for endurance exercise. Research has also linked carnitine to reduced muscle soreness, faster recovery after intense training, and improved oxygen delivery to muscles. Some athletes use L-carnitine L-tartrate, a specific form shown to benefit recovery from resistance training.4. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs)BCAAs, which include leucine, isoleucine, and valine, are essential amino acids found in high-protein foods such as dairy, soybeans, lentils, nuts, eggs, chicken, and seeds. These amino acids are unique because they can be directly used by muscles for energy during exercise, helping to prevent muscle breakdown. Leucine in particular acts as a signal to start muscle protein synthesis, the process of building new muscle tissue. Research suggests Supplemental BCAAs may help reduce fatigue during long workouts, decrease muscle soreness, and support recovery, especially if your diet is low in protein or you are training in a fasted state.5. Whey proteinWhey protein is a complete, fast-digesting protein derived from milk during the cheese-making process. It is rich in all essential amino acids, particularly leucine, which triggers muscle growth. Foods that naturally contain whey include milk, yogurt, cheese, and other dairy products, although in smaller amounts compared to a concentrated supplement. According to studies whey protein shakes are a convenient way to ensure your muscles get the nutrients they need for repair right after training. Beyond muscle growth, whey can also help maintain lean mass during fat loss phases, support immune function, and improve satiety.Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.

How to identify cancerous lumps: Key signs, common locations, and when to see a doctor

Cancerous lumps often feel hard with uneven edges. They usually stay fixed under the skin and are often painless. Rapid growth and unexplained weight loss are warning signs. Lumps can appear in the breast, neck, or groin. See a doctor for any hard, fixed, or growing lump. Early diagnosis is key for better treatment outcomes.  Finding a lump on your body can be worrying, but it’s important to know how to identify if it might be cancerous. Most lumps are benign and harmless, but cancerous lumps often have specific features. They tend to feel hard or firm, have irregular or uneven edges, and are usually fixed or immobile under the skin. Unlike painful lumps caused by infections, cancerous lumps are often painless and persistent. Rapid growth, noticeable changes in texture, persistence beyond two weeks, and associated symptoms like unexplained weight loss, night sweats, or fatigue are warning signs. Early medical assessment is vital for proper diagnosis and timely treatment.What is a cancerous lump and how do they feelAccording to a study published in Bowen Icon Cancer Center, a cancerous lump is an abnormal mass formed by uncontrolled cell growth that can invade surrounding tissues. These lumps can arise in different tissues and organs and often require urgent medical attention.Understanding the texture and feel of lumps can provide important clues:Hard or firm: Cancerous lumps often feel much harder or firmer than benign lumps. They may feel like a solid mass under the skin.Irregular surface: Unlike smooth benign lumps such as cysts or lipomas, cancerous lumps tend to have an irregular, uneven, or bumpy surface.Fixed in place: Cancerous lumps often feel fixed or immobile because they can adhere to the skin, muscle, or other tissues. Benign lumps typically move slightly when pressed.Non-tender or painless: Many cancerous lumps do not cause pain, especially early on. Pain is more commonly associated with infections, inflammation, or trauma.How large can a cancerous lump becomeA cancerous lump often begins as a small growth, sometimes only a few millimeters across. As the cancer develops, the lump can gradually increase in size. When it grows to 1 to 2 centimeters or larger, it is usually a sign that medical evaluation is necessary. Without treatment, the lump may expand rapidly, potentially causing more serious health issues. This highlights the importance of early detection and prompt medical attention to improve outcomes, prevent spread, and enhance treatment effectiveness.Common locations for cancerous lumpsCancerous lumps can appear anywhere, but some locations are more common and warrant particular attention:1. BreastBreast lumps are common and most are benign. However, any new, hard, or irregular lump in the breast should be examined urgently.Men can also develop breast lumps, though breast cancer in men is rare.2. Neck and throatPersistent swollen lymph nodes in the neck may indicate lymphoma or metastasis from other cancers.Hard lumps in the thyroid gland could suggest thyroid cancer.3. GroinLumps here may be swollen lymph nodes. Hard, fixed lumps could signal lymphoma or other cancers.4. SkinAny new, changing, or unusual skin lumps, nodules, or growths should be assessed.Skin cancers such as melanoma may present as irregular lumps that change colour or bleed.5. Other areasCancerous lumps can also occur in internal organs but are not usually palpable unless advanced.Soft tissue sarcomas can cause deep lumps in muscles or fat.Warning signs of cancerous lumpsLook out for the following red flags:Lump feels very hard or firm.Lump has an irregular shape or uneven borders.Lump is fixed and doesn’t move when pressed.Lump is growing rapidly or changing over weeks.Lump is painless or causing unexplained symptoms.Skin changes over the lump, such as redness, ulceration, or bleeding.Associated systemic symptoms like unexplained weight loss, fever, night sweats, or fatigue.When to see a doctorIt’s important to get a medical opinion if you notice:Any lump that is hard, fixed, or irregular.A lump growing in size or not disappearing after two weeks.Lumps accompanied by general symptoms like weight loss or fever.Any lump that causes concern or anxiety.Early diagnosis and treatment are critical for the best outcomes.Diagnosis and treatmentYour doctor will usually start by examining the lump and asking about its duration, any associated symptoms, and your medical history. Sometimes, they may recommend:Ultrasound or other imaging scans.Blood tests.Biopsy or fine needle aspiration for tissue sampling.Treatment depends on the cause, many lumps need no treatment, while others may require antibiotics, minor surgery, or specialist referral.Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.

Herpes virus triggers mood disorders through neurological impact
Herpes, beyond skin manifestations, potentially impacts neurological and psychological health, with HHV-6 linked to mood disorders. The virus infects neurons, triggering neuroinflammation and disrupting brain function, influencing cognition and emotional regulation. Understanding this broader impact is crucial for developing comprehensive treatment strategies and improving the quality of life for affected individuals.

The virus infects neurons, triggering neuroinflammation and disrupting brain function, influencing cognition and emotional regulation. Understanding this broader impact is crucial for developing comprehensive treatment strategies and improving the quality of life for affected individuals.  Herpes is a common viral infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), which primarily affects the skin, mouth, and genital regions. While most people associate herpes with visible sores or occasional flare-ups, the virus has a unique ability to remain dormant in nerve cells and reactivate unpredictably, often triggered by stress, illness, or a weakened immune system. This ability to lie hidden makes herpes a persistent and sometimes underestimated health concern.Beyond the more familiar physical symptoms, recent research done by Frontiers in Microbiology, WHO and studies published in NIH has uncovered a surprising and less-discussed dimension of herpes: its potential impact on neurological and psychological health. In particular, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) has been linked to mood disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder. The virus can infect neurons and trigger neuroinflammation, disrupting normal brain function and potentially influencing cognition, emotional regulation, and overall mental well-being.These findings underscore the need for broader awareness of herpes beyond its skin-related manifestations. Understanding the virus’s full spectrum of effects can help medical professionals develop targeted treatment strategies, including antiviral therapies and interventions to support neurological and psychological health. For individuals living with herpes, early detection, regular monitoring, and comprehensive care can significantly improve quality of life and reduce the risk of complications.Understanding herpes virus and its neurological impactHuman herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is a strain of the herpes virus that can infect a variety of cells, including neurons in the brain. Research published in Frontiers in Microbiology demonstrates that HHV-6 has the ability to target Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, which play a vital role in motor control, coordination, and cognitive functions. Infection of these neurons can interfere with normal brain activity, potentially leading to cognitive disturbances, impaired motor skills, and an increased risk of mood disorders such as depression or bipolar disorder.These findings highlight that herpes is far more than a skin or genital infection, it can have profound effects on neurological and psychological health. Understanding the virus’s broader impact is crucial for developing effective treatment strategies, early detection protocols, and preventive measures. By recognizing the full scope of HHV-6’s potential effects on the brain, medical professionals and patients alike can adopt more comprehensive approaches to managing and mitigating its long-term consequences.How herpes virus triggers neuroinflammation in mood disordersOne of the primary ways the herpes virus can impact mental health is through neuroinflammation according to a study in NIH. When herpes infects neurons, it can trigger an inflammatory response in the brain, interfering with normal neural signaling and communication. This virus-induced inflammation has been linked to psychiatric conditions, including depression, bipolar disorder, and cognitive disturbances.Researchers are actively investigating how controlling or reducing neuroinflammation could help mitigate the neurological and psychological effects of herpes. By combining antiviral therapies with strategies aimed at calming inflammation in the brain, medical professionals may be able to offer a dual approach to treatment, addressing both the viral activity and its neurological consequences. This integrated perspective not only broadens understanding of herpes beyond its physical symptoms but also opens new avenues for improving mental health outcomes in affected individuals.Herpes virus, genetics, and environmental factorsMood disorders are complex conditions shaped by a combination of genetic predispositions and environmental influences. Among these environmental factors, herpes virus can act as a trigger, potentially worsening psychiatric symptoms in individuals who have a genetic vulnerability. According to a study published in NIH, by infecting neurons and promoting neuroinflammation, herpes may amplify existing risks for conditions such as depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety.Recognizing herpes as a contributing factor in mental health challenges allows researchers and clinicians to develop more holistic treatment approaches. These strategies aim not only to control viral activity but also to address its psychological and neurological consequences. Understanding the interplay between genetic susceptibility and viral triggers can lead to more personalized therapies, early interventions, and improved outcomes for individuals affected by both herpes and mood disorders.Emerging herpes treatments and researchWhile antiviral medications like acyclovir and valacyclovir effectively manage herpes outbreaks according to WHO, emerging research is exploring therapies that could address herpes’ neurological effects. Key areas include:Targeted antiviral therapies: Personalized regimens to reduce viral reactivation and minimize neuroinflammation.Herpes vaccines: Early-stage research aims to prevent both initial infection and recurring outbreaks.Anti-inflammatory interventions: Medications or lifestyle strategies to reduce herpes-related brain inflammation.These approaches may not only control herpes physically but also alleviate associated mood disturbances. Reducing stigma around herpes and mental healthStigma surrounding herpes often intensifies its psychological impact. Many individuals living with the virus experience feelings of shame, embarrassment, or social anxiety, which can prevent them from seeking timely medical care. This reluctance not only exacerbates mood disorders such as depression and anxiety but also reduces adherence to treatment, potentially worsening physical and mental health outcomes.Raising public awareness about herpes, providing accurate sexual health education, and fostering open, nonjudgmental conversations about the infection can play a critical role in reducing stigma. When people feel informed and supported, they are more likely to seek medical advice, adhere to treatment plans, and manage both the physical and psychological effects of the virus. Addressing stigma is therefore essential for improving mental health outcomes, promoting overall well-being, and empowering individuals to lead confident, healthy lives despite a herpes diagnosis.Herpes is more than a virus causing visible outbreaks; it has the potential to affect neurological and mental health through infection and inflammation of the brain. By recognizing herpes as a factor in mood disorders like depression and bipolar disorder, healthcare providers and patients can adopt strategies that combine antiviral treatment, mental health support, and lifestyle interventions. Increasing awareness, reducing stigma, and advancing research are key to helping those affected by herpes live healthier, more confident lives.Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

The National Family Health Survey reveals a high prevalence, necessitating targeted interventions. Government initiatives like Anemia Mukt Bharat and POSHAN Abhiyaan aim to combat this through supplementation, improved nutrition, and awareness campaigns.  Anemia, a condition marked by a shortage of healthy red blood cells necessary to carry adequate oxygen to the body’s tissues, has traditionally been seen as a challenge primarily affecting rural India. However, recent data shows a worrying shift: urban women are now increasingly experiencing this silent health crisis. Despite better access to healthcare, improved sanitation, and higher living standards, factors such as poor dietary choices, irregular meal patterns, busy lifestyles, and socio-economic pressures are contributing to the rising prevalence of anemia in city settings.Iron deficiency, vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, and inadequate consumption of nutrient-rich foods like leafy greens, pulses, and lean proteins are common culprits. Additionally, lifestyle factors including stress, irregular sleep, and high consumption of processed foods can exacerbate the problem. The growing incidence of anemia among urban women according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and a survey conducted by The National Family Health Survey highlights the need for greater awareness, proactive screening, and nutrition-focused interventions to protect their health, productivity, and overall well-being.Understanding anemia: A growing concern for urban womenAnemia is most commonly caused by iron deficiency, but insufficient levels of other essential nutrients like folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin A also contribute significantly to the condition. According to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, anemia occurs when hemoglobin levels in the blood are too low, reducing its capacity to transport oxygen to vital organs and tissues. This oxygen shortage can lead to fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and compromised immune function.In addition to nutritional deficiencies, factors such as menstrual blood loss, pregnancy, chronic illnesses, and poor dietary diversity can exacerbate anemia, particularly among women. Understanding the multifactorial causes of anemia is critical for prevention, timely diagnosis, and effective treatment strategies, especially in urban populations where lifestyle and dietary habits may increase vulnerability.Alarming statistics: The prevalence of anemia in urban IndiaThe National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), conducted between 2019 and 2021, reveals a concerning trend: 57% of Indian women aged 15–49 years are anemic, compared to just 25% of men in the same age group. This stark gender disparity highlights how women, particularly of reproductive age, are disproportionately affected by anemia due to factors such as menstrual blood loss, pregnancy, and nutritional deficiencies. The data underscores the urgent need for targeted interventions, including nutrition education, iron and vitamin supplementation, and lifestyle modifications.Addressing anemia among women is not only critical for their own health but also has broader implications for family well-being and community development. Adequate hemoglobin levels support energy, cognitive function, and immunity, enabling women to lead productive lives. Without focused measures, the high prevalence of anemia can perpetuate cycles of poor health, reduced work capacity, and intergenerational nutritional challenges, making it a pressing public health concern that demands immediate attention.Factors contributing to anemia among urban womenDietary habitsUrban diets often include a high intake of processed foods, leading to nutritional deficiencies. The consumption of dark green leafy vegetables, rich in iron, remains suboptimal among urban women.Lifestyle choicesSedentary lifestyles and increased stress levels can exacerbate health issues, including anemia. The lack of physical activity and poor dietary choices contribute to the condition.Socio-Economic factorsWomen from lower socio-economic backgrounds are more susceptible to anemia. Limited access to nutritious food and healthcare services increases the risk.Educational levelsLower levels of education are associated with higher rates of anemia. Educated women are more likely to be aware of nutritional needs and health services.Government initiatives to combat anemiaThe Indian government has launched several initiatives to address anemia:Anemia Mukt Bharat (AMB) Program: This program focuses on reducing anemia through iron and folic acid supplementation, deworming, and improving dietary practices.POSHAN Abhiyaan: A national mission to improve nutritional outcomes for children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.School Health Program: Aimed at screening and treating anemia among school-going children and adolescents.Anemia among urban women in India is a complex and multifaceted health issue that demands comprehensive, targeted strategies. Public health campaigns play a crucial role in raising awareness about the causes, risks, and prevention of anemia, while regular health screenings help identify cases early, allowing timely intervention. Improving dietary habits by promoting iron-rich foods, fortified products, and balanced nutrition is essential for preventing nutrient deficiencies that contribute to anemia.In addition, lifestyle modifications, such as stress management, adequate sleep, and education on healthy eating practices, can further support women’s overall well-being.

Your lip health may signal heart problems: 6 warning signs you should not ignore
Lips serve as indicators of overall health, reflecting hydration and nutrition levels. Changes in lip color, texture, or moisture can signal potential health concerns like nutritional deficiencies, infections, or systemic conditions. Maintaining hydration, a nutrient-rich diet, and protective habits are crucial for detecting problems early and supporting both lip health and overall wellness.

Changes in lip color, texture, or moisture can signal potential health concerns like nutritional deficiencies, infections, or systemic conditions. Maintaining hydration, a nutrient-rich diet, and protective habits are crucial for detecting problems early and supporting both lip health and overall wellness.  Our lips are not just a prominent facial feature—they serve as a visible indicator of overall health. Normally, healthy lips appear soft, smooth, and pink, reflecting proper hydration and nutrition. Changes in their color, texture, or moisture levels can signal potential health concerns, ranging from nutritional deficiencies and dehydration to infections or systemic conditions. Studies and reputable health sources emphasise that lips often reveal early warning signs before other symptoms appear, making them a valuable tool for monitoring well-being. Regularly observing the condition of your lips, maintaining proper hydration, and ensuring a nutrient-rich diet can help detect problems early and support both lip health and overall wellness.How lips indicate internal health problemsAccording to health organisations, the lips, like skin and nails, provide visible cues about the body’s internal state. Changes in lip appearance—such as paleness, dryness, swelling, or unusual pigmentation—may reflect issues with circulation, hydration, nutrient levels, or immune function.Your lips are a subtle but powerful indicator of internal health. From dryness and cracking to color changes or swelling, these signs may reveal nutritional deficiencies, infections, or systemic conditions. By observing your lips, maintaining hydration, practicing good hygiene, and supporting overall health through nutrition, you can protect both your lips and your well-being.A study published in the National Library of Medicine, emphasises that lip color and texture are closely linked to cardiovascular, respiratory, and nutritional health, making them important indicators to monitor.Common warning signs from your lipsPale or bluish lipsPale or bluish lips may indicate low oxygen levels in the blood, potentially linked to anemia, respiratory problems, or poor circulation. As reported, persistent paleness can signal an underlying deficiency in red blood cells or cardiovascular issues.Dry and chapped lipsDry, cracked, or chapped lips are common in cold or dry climates. However, persistent dryness can also suggest dehydration, vitamin deficiencies (especially B vitamins), or malnutrition. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), lips are highly sensitive to hydration and nutrient levels, so ongoing dryness should be investigated.Swollen lipsLip swelling can occur due to allergic reactions, infections, or inflammatory conditions. Resources like the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) highlight that sudden or recurrent swelling may require medical attention to rule out conditions like angioedema or allergic responses.Sores or lesionsSores, blisters, or lesions may result from viral infections such as cold sores (herpes simplex virus) or canker sores. Studies indicate that recurrent lesions can affect quality of life and may signal immune system weakness or chronic stress.Cracks at the corners of the mouthCracks or splits at the corners of the lips—a condition called angular cheilitis—are linked to iron or B-vitamin deficiencies or fungal infections. As health sources note that improving nutrition and maintaining lip hygiene can prevent these painful cracks.Discoloration or unusual pigmentationDark spots or unusual pigmentation on the lips may indicate hormonal imbalances, vitamin deficiencies, or reactions to medications. Research shows that lip discoloration can sometimes signal underlying systemic issues, making observation important for early detection.Prevention tips to maintain healthy lipsMaintaining healthy lips involves both lifestyle habits and attention to overall health. Health studies and websites provide these evidence-based tips:Stay hydratedDrinking sufficient water is essential for lip moisture. The NIH recommends balancing hydration throughout the day, as lips are among the first areas to show dehydration.Use lip protectionApplying a lip balm with SPF can prevent sun damage, dryness, and irritation. The AAD highlights that protecting lips from UV exposure reduces the risk of long-term damage and discoloration.Avoid licking lipsSaliva evaporates quickly, leaving lips drier than before. Avoiding excessive lip licking helps maintain moisture and prevents chapping.Eat a nutrient-rich dietA diet rich in iron, vitamins B2, B3, B6, and B12 supports healthy lips. Health studies show that deficiencies in these nutrients often manifest first in skin and lip changes.Protect lips from extreme weatherWind, cold, and dry climates can damage lips. Covering lips with scarves, masks, or moisturizers reduces the impact of environmental stressors.Identify allergensAvoid substances that trigger lip swelling or irritation, such as certain cosmetics or foods. Studies on contact dermatitis indicate that early avoidance reduces recurring inflammation.Maintain hygieneDo not share lip products such as balms or lipsticks, as this can transmit infections. Good hygiene supports both lip health and overall immune defense."Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Rumours suggest global icons Billie Eilish and Linkin Park could headline, alongside major acts from America and India. Talks are ongoing with major alternative metal bands and EDM artists, but nothing has been officially confirmed.Nillohit BagchiUpdated: Aug 14, 2025, 10:57 IST  4  min read  The buzz around Lollapalooza India 2026 has officially begun, and if the rumours are true, fans are in for a massive treat. Insider chatter and Reddit claims suggest Billie Eilish and Linkin Park have already signed contracts for headline performances. While the organisers have yet to confirm, the news has set social media on fire, with fans speculating on what could be one of the most diverse and high-energy festival lineups in recent memory. Alongside these global stars, several other big names are reportedly in talks, making the Lollapalooza 2026 edition a highly anticipated event for music lovers in India and beyond.Rumour mill: Billie Eilish and Linkin Park to take centre stage in Lollapalooza 2026? According to insiders in Lollapalooza India’s Reddit subreddit (r/lollapaloozaind), Billie Eilish, fresh off her latest world tour, Hit Me Hard and Soft, could bring her signature mix of haunting vocals and electrifying stage presence to the festival. 
 Billie Eilish, fresh off her latest world tour, Hit Me Hard and Soft, could bring her signature mix of haunting vocals and electrifying stage presence to the festival (Credits: X/@billiesource)Scoopwhoop reported that the seven-time AMA (American Music Awards) winner Linkin Park may co-headline the music festival. The rock band’s involvement is equally exciting, marking what could be a rare and emotional live set for the legendary rock band. If confirmed, their inclusion would give Lollapalooza India a unique blend of alternative, pop, rock, and metal energy.
 Linkin Park may co-headline Lollapalooza 2026 India (Credits: X/@linkinpark)Sharing alleged inside information about Billie and Linkin Park’s rumoured sets, one Reddit user wrote, “I can confirm the following: Billie Eilish (for headline slot), Linkin Park, M.I.A., Raja Kumari, Raftaar have signed contracts officially. They are negotiating with My Chemical Romance, but the band wants more of a payout, which would affect the festival budget. David Guetta is in talks, but nothing has been signed yet, and again, like MCR, it’s both a logistical and financial issue. A lot of people have been saying Bruno Mars, but my source has told me that it is false, and they have not reached out.”

Negotiations are reportedly ongoing with American alt rock/metal band, My Chemical Romance (Credits: X/@rt_yourfavbands)Negotiations are reportedly ongoing with American alt-rock/metal band My Chemical Romance, though budget concerns are creating hurdles. Well-known EDM artist David Guetta is also in talks, but nothing has been signed yet. As for the widely rumoured Bruno Mars, insiders insist there’s no truth to his inclusion.A dream come true for music enthusiasts in IndiaIf the rumours prove true, Lollapalooza 2026 could mark the first-ever India performances for both Billie Eilish and Linkin Park. For long-time rock and metal fans, Linkin Park’s arrival would be a dream come true, fulfilling years of anticipation after speculation that they might come in 2025. Their music shaped an entire generation, and seeing them live in India would be a historic moment. 
Billie Eilish commands a massive fanbase in India (Credits: X/@billiesource)On the other hand, Gen Z favourite Billie Eilish commands a massive fanbase in the country, with her unique style and chart-topping hits making her one of the most anticipated potential headliners of the festival.Despite the growing excitement, festival organisers have not confirmed any of these names. Lollapalooza India is known for delivering big surprises, so fans will have to wait for the official lineup announcement. Until then, speculation will continue, and if these rumours turn into reality, 2026 might just be Indian music fans’ biggest year yet.

The test requires you to position your hands on your thighs while performing repeated palm flips upwards, then downwards, or to perform rapid thumb tapping between your fingers in sequence followed by sequence reversal  You do not (always) have to get an invasive test done to gauge the health of your brain. If you are otherwise healthy, some really simple home tests can also tell you if all is okay in the brain. Wondering how? Let's take a look...The RAM testThe Rapid Alternate Movement (RAM) test is a basic neurological examination, which evaluates the brain-muscle coordination needed to create smooth coordinated movements. The test targets the cerebellum, which functions as the control center for balance together with muscle coordination, and precise movement execution. During the RAM test, you need to perform quick hand flipping motions or finger tapping patterns. Difficulty with smooth and fast test performance can indicate problems in the brain or nervous system that result from cerebellar dysfunction, which often appears after injuries, strokes and brain-related medical conditions.What is the Rapid Alternate Movement testThe RAM test evaluates your capability to execute fast repetitive movements using your hands or feet. The examination sometimes goes by the name of dysdiadochokinesia assessment, because it tests rapid alternating movement abilities. The test requires you to position your hands on your thighs while performing repeated palm flips upwards, then downwards, or to perform rapid thumb tapping between your fingers in sequence followed by sequence reversal. The assessment evaluates how fluidly and rapidly you perform the movements. Slow, uncoordinated or clumsy movements during the test can suggest problems with the cerebellum. Doctors utilise this examination to evaluate brain operations and coordination, primarily focusing on the cerebellum.How to perform the RAM test at homeThe RAM test has a home version which helps you evaluate your motor skills and coordination abilities. Here’s how:Sit comfortably on a chair with your feet flat on the ground and your hands resting on your thighs.Place your hands flat on your thighs with the palms down.Perform quick hand movements by facing your palms up and then immediately facing them back down toward the bottom. Perform these movements as quickly and smoothly as possible for 10 seconds.The finger tapping version of the test requires you to touch your thumb tip to your index finger tip followed by middle finger tip then ring finger tip and pinky tip before repeating the sequence in reverse order. Execute these movements with maximum speed and fluidity for the entire 10 seconds.Test each hand separately before combining them into a single hand operation.Medical evaluation of your brain coordination centers becomes necessary when you experience either speed difficulties, or unsteady movements during the test.What does the RAM Test tell youThe RAM test functions as a brief assessment tool to evaluate motor coordination capabilities of your brain. Rapid alternating movement problems usually indicate cerebellum, or its connection pathway abnormalities. The conditions of stroke, brain injuries, multiple sclerosis and tumors that impact brain coordination, tend to cause this type of problem. The RAM test cannot diagnose diseases directly, but indicates that you should seek professional neurological evaluation if you experience any difficulty with the test, especially when combined with dizziness, imbalance or weakness.Limitations of the RAM TestThe RAM test functions as a single component within a complete neurological examination. The test fails to identify the specific nature of the issue, or its precise brain location. Your test performance can be influenced by stress together with tiredness, as well as nutritional deficiencies. However, the test cannot give any precise results on any condition.Sources:https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/nursingskills/chapter/6-8-assessing-cerebellar-function/https://med.stanford.edu/stanfordmedicine25/the25/cerebellar.htmlhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559262/Disclaimer: This article is informational only and not a substitute for medical adviceGet the latest lifestyle updates on Times of India, along with Happy Independence Day wishes, messages, and quotes !About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Making THESE changes in the diet can lower blood pressure
A recent study highlights the significant benefits of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables for individuals with hypertension. The research demonstrates that incorporating more fruits and vegetables into one's diet can effectively lower blood pressure, improve kidney health, and reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Unlike sodium bicarbonate, fruits and vegetables achieve these benefits while potentially reducing the need for medication.

A recent study highlights the significant benefits of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables for individuals with hypertension. The research demonstrates that incorporating more fruits and vegetables into one's diet can effectively lower blood pressure, improve kidney health, and reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Unlike sodium bicarbonate, fruits and vegetables achieve these benefits while potentially reducing the need for medication. High blood pressure, aka hypertension, affects about 1.28 billion adults (aged 30–79) globally. Among these, about 46% are unaware that this condition exists, according to the WHO. High blood pressure is a silent killer and could lead to chronic illnesses, such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Certain factors increase the risk of hypertension; however, some of them are in our control, and one is diet. A 2024 study found that making certain dietary changes can lower blood pressure and improve kidney and heart health. The findings of the five-year interventional randomized control trial are published in The American Journal of Medicine. Watch what you eatFocusing on a diet that is rich in fruits and vegetables is crucial in the treatment of hypertension patients, according to doctors. Despite efforts, hypertension-related chronic kidney disease and its cardiovascular mortality are increasing. Heart disease is the number one reason that patients with chronic kidney disease die.PollWhich factor do you think has the most significant impact on managing high blood pressure?Healthy diet (fruits & vegetables)MedicationSo what should you eat to lower blood pressure? DASH. Yes, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, is proven to lower blood pressure. This is a flexible and balanced eating plan, that is rich in fruits and vegetables. It is the recommended first-line treatment for primary hypertension. Despite scientific evidence, the DASH diet is under-prescribed and under-implemented.“As a nephrologist (kidney doctor), my acid-base laboratory studies ways by which the kidney removes acid from the blood and puts it into the urine. Our animal studies showed years ago that mechanisms used by the kidneys to remove acid from the blood can cause kidney injury if the animals were chronically (long-term) exposed to an acid-producing diet. Our patient studies showed similar findings: that is, an acid-producing diet (one high in animal products) was kidney-harmful, and one that is base-producing (one high in fruits and vegetables) is kidney-healthy. Other investigators showed that a diet high in fruits and vegetables is heart-healthy. We hypothesized that one way that fruits and vegetables are both kidney- and heart-healthy is that they reduce the amount of acid in the diet and therefore the amount of acid that kidneys have to remove from the body,” Donald E. Wesson, MD, MBA, lead investigator Department of Internal Medicine, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, said, in a statement.The study To test the hypothesis, they conducted a study with participants who had hypertension, but not diabetes, and very high levels of urine albumin excretion (macroalbuminuria). Those with macroalbuminuria have chronic kidney disease, a high risk for the worsening of their kidney disease with time, and a high risk to subsequently developing cardiovascular diseases. The trial took over a five-year period, where the 153 participants with hypertension were divided into three groups:Study participants added 2-4 cups of base-producing fruits and vegetables in addition to their usual daily food intakeStudy participants were prescribed NaHCO3 (acid-reducing sodium bicarbonate, which is common baking soda) tablets in two daily doses of 4-5 650 mg tabletsStudy participants receiving standard medical care from primary care cliniciansHow diet plays a crucial roleThe findings of the study confirmed that consumption of fruits and vegetables and NaHCO3 improved kidney health, but only fruits and vegetables, and not NaHCO3, reduced blood pressure and improved indices of cardiovascular disease risk.“Importantly, fruits and vegetables achieved the latter two benefits with lower doses of medication used to lower blood pressure and reduce cardiovascular disease risk. This means that one can get the kidney health benefits with either fruits and vegetables or NaHCO3, but we get the blood pressure reduction and reduced cardiovascular disease risk with fruits and vegetables, but not with NaHCO3. This supports our recommendation that fruits and vegetables should be ‘foundational’ treatment for patients with hypertension, because we accomplish all three goals (kidney health, lower blood pressure, and reduced cardiovascular disease risk) with fruits and vegetables, and we can do so with lower medication doses,” co-investigator Maninder Kahlon, PhD, Department of Population Health, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, explains.Low blood pressure got you down? Try these 4 home fixes!"Dietary interventions for chronic disease management are often not recommended and even less often executed because of the many challenges to get patients to implement them. Nevertheless, they are effective, and in this instance, kidney and cardiovascular protective. We must increase our efforts to incorporate them into patient management and more broadly, make healthy diets more accessible to populations at increased risk for kidney and cardiovascular disease,” Dr. Wesson adds.Get the latest lifestyle updates on Times of India, along with Happy Independence Day wishes, messages, and quotes !About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Do BP readings differ between arms? Doctor explains what it means
Small blood pressure differences between arms are common, usually under 10 mmHg. However, a consistent difference exceeding 10-15 mmHg warrants medical consultation, potentially indicating artery narrowing or, rarely, aortic dissection. Doctors often check both arms to uncover hidden circulation issues, advising consistent use of the arm with higher readings for future measurements.

However, a consistent difference exceeding 10-15 mmHg warrants medical consultation, potentially indicating artery narrowing or, rarely, aortic dissection. Doctors often check both arms to uncover hidden circulation issues, advising consistent use of the arm with higher readings for future measurements.   You’re sitting in the doctor’s office, they slap the cuff on your right arm, pump it up, and read out your blood pressure. But then they decide to check the left arm too… and wait a minute the numbers don’t match. Cue the little voice in your head: Is something wrong?Let’s talk about why this happens, when it’s totally fine, and when it might be a sign to dig deeper.Yep, it’s normal… sometimesFirst, don’t panic. Small differences in blood pressure between your two arms are actually pretty common. In fact, for most healthy people, it’s normal to see a difference of up to 10 mmHg (that’s millimeters of mercury, the unit for BP).So if your right arm says 122/78 and your left says 128/80, you can probably relax, it’s likely just normal variation.When the difference could mean something moreNow, here’s the important bit, according to Harvard Health, if there’s a consistent difference of more than 10–15 mmHg between your arms, especially in the top (systolic) number, it’s worth talking to your doctor.Larger, ongoing differences can sometimes be linked to:Artery narrowing (Peripheral Artery Disease) – If one arm has a partially blocked artery, it can affect blood flow and pressure readings.Aortic dissection (rare, but serious) – This is a sudden tear in the aorta wall. It’s an emergency and comes with other severe symptoms like chest pain.Recently, Dr Sudhir Kumar took to X to explain this phenomenon. "1. Variation of systolic BP up to 10 mmHg and diastolic BP of up to 5 mmHg between two arms is normal. Always use the higher arm reading for recording. 2. If the inter-arm variation is greater than 15 mmHg, it is NOT normal- could be suggestive of a vascular disease- get evaluated by a doctor," he posted on X.Why doctors sometimes check both armsMedical pros know that arm-to-arm BP differences can reveal hidden circulation issues. That’s why many guidelines suggest measuring both arms at least once during checkups, especially for new patients or anyone at higher cardiovascular risk.If one arm consistently shows higher readings, your doctor might recommend using that arm for all future measurements to keep your numbers consistent.What you can do at homeIf you’ve got a blood pressure monitor at home (and honestly, they’re a great investment if you care about heart health), here’s how to check:Measure both arms – Sit quietly for 5 minutes, then check your BP on one arm, rest for a minute, and check the other.Keep a log – Write down your readings and any noticeable patterns.Talk to your doctor – If the difference is consistently over 10–15 mmHg, bring your log to your next appointment.A small difference in blood pressure between arms? Totally normal. But if you’re seeing a bigger, consistent gap, don’t ignore it—it could be your body’s way of flagging something important.Your arms might look the same on the outside, but the blood vessels inside could be telling two different stories. Checking both arms every once in a while is a simple, quick way to keep an eye on your circulation health.Next time a nurse or doctor checks your BP, you’ll know exactly why they sometimes switch sides. Not because they’re bored… but because your arms might be trying to tell them something.Get the latest lifestyle updates on Times of India, along with Happy Independence Day wishes, messages, and quotes !About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Influencers miss flight after ChatGPT advice: The twist will leave you speechless
Couple Mery Caldass and Alejandro Cid faced airport trouble. They were traveling to Puerto Rico. ChatGPT gave them wrong travel advice. It said no visa was needed. But an ESTA was necessary. They missed this detail. The couple got stuck. Another man was hospitalized. He followed AI suggestions. Experts advise caution with AI.

They were traveling to Puerto Rico. ChatGPT gave them wrong travel advice. It said no visa was needed. But an ESTA was necessary. They missed this detail. The couple got stuck. Another man was hospitalized. He followed AI suggestions. Experts advise caution with AI.   Influencer couple Mery Caldass and Alejandro Cid were all set for what should’ve been a dreamy trip to Puerto Rico. But instead of basking in beach vibes, they ended up stuck in an airport, sobbing and blaming none other than ChatGPT for their nightmare.In a now-viral TikTok with over 13,000 views, as reported by New York Post, Mery with tears streaming, frustration loud and clearly explains that, “I always do tons of research, but I asked ChatGPT and it said no visa was needed.” Which, sure, sounds convenient. But unfortunately, that “advice” missed a tiny, yet crucial detail: while they didn’t need a visa for Puerto Rico, they did need something called an ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorization). It’s kind of like a quick online clearance that ChatGPT apparently forgot to mention.Unsurprisingly, the clip lit up the internet. A lot of people had words. Some were with the sarcasm, like commenting, “Natural selection, I guess,” mocking their decision to rely on ChatGPT for something important. Another quipped, “Who trusts ChatGPT for that kind of info?”On the flip side, a few folks defended the AI: maybe the couple just didn’t phrase their question properly, sure, they asked if they needed a visa, but they never asked whether an ESTA was necessary. What is ESTA?The ESTA, short for Electronic System for Travel Authorization, is basically an online permission slip. If you’re from one of the eligible countries, you don’t need a full visa, but you do need to fill out this quick online form before you travel. It’s not a visa interview or a mountain of paperwork, just an application you do online, pay a small fee for, and usually get approved within minutes (though they say apply at least 72 hours before your trip, just in case). Once approved, it’s valid for two years, and you can use it for multiple trips. Think of it as a “fast pass” but skip it, and you might end up like those influencers stuck at the airport instead of sipping piña coladas.Another ChatGPT mishapThis isn’t the only headline-grabbing ChatGPT slip-up lately. Other stories have spotlighted more concerning misadventures: one older guy ended up hospitalized with hallucinations after following AI-generated suggestions. Clearly, when it comes to AI, a healthy dose of skepticism and double-checking is a must.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousRubina Dilaik's powerful reality show lookstvIn pic: Radiant pictures of Pooja HegdeEntertainment5 human body parts we may no longer need in the futureLifestyleBollywood-approved ethnic sets that are perfect for Independence Day 2025Lifestyle10 Stunning ethnic looks of Megha Shettytv10 celeb-inspired Indian baby girl namesLifestyleOne's own enemy: 8 animals that get triggered by their own reflectionLifestyleIndependence Day 2025: 10 inspiring lines on Freedom that warm the heartLifestyleJanmashtami 2025: Ethnic Glam Lessons from Malavika MohananEntertainmentHow to build a balcony water garden with easy care stepsLifestyle Next123 Photostories  5 simple chia seed recipes that help in weight loss5 foods that can lower the chances of getting a strokeWhy Aarti has 5 flames: The deep meaning behind itIndia at 79: PM Modi leads Independence Day celebrations - In pics5 unique and must-have desserts made with eggsIndependence Day 2025: Bollywood actors who have portrayed freedom fightersDid you know Sameera Reddy was the first Indian actress to have her own video game?From forest to ice: 6 animals that vanish into their habitatFreedom Trails: Cities where India’s independence was forgedIndependence Day special: This Indian floral fabric threatened Europe’s textile industry123Tired of too many ads?go ad free nowlifestyle videos13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement16:34Life After 60: Why India's seniors are choosing community living04:34Control Your Senses, Gain Knowledge, Attain Peace: Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4.3906:37Cultural Clashes in Love: How To Make Your Relationship Work03:19Prayagraj MahaKumbh 2025 Readies For Millions: Massive Preparations Underway In Uttar Pradesh04:48Sadhguru Reveals The Truth About Black Magic And Your Photograph07:18BK Shivani On Forgiveness: Why It’s Essential For Inner Peace08:08How Bhairavi Sadhana Accelerates Your Path to Liberation: Sadhguru Speaks06:47Breakup Recovery: How To Not Wallow In Misery And Love Yourself03:20The Purifying Power of Yajna: Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4, Verse 3011:41How Dattatreya Accepted Parashuram as His Disciple – Sadhguru Reveals03:54Can Water Remember?

Opt for fabrics like georgette, chiffon, or cotton that flow beautifully and allow easy movement for dancing and festivities. Add a vibrant petticoat for extra volume, because more twirl means more charm.
View this post on InstagramThe wrap-and-tuck skirt methodIf using a saree, start by tucking one end firmly into your waist and wrap it around until you get a comfortable fit. Secure with a discreet pin to avoid mishaps. For ready-made skirts, choose one with a good flare to mimic that traditional Gopi silhouette.

Instead, tuck one end into your skirt at the waist, bring it diagonally across your torso, loop it behind your back, and drape it gracefully over the opposite shoulder. This gives a traditional yet flattering look, echoing classical temple styles.

Pair a royal blue skirt with a bright yellow dupatta for a Radha-inspired look, or try deep pink with green for a festive contrast. Embroidery, mirror work, or simple golden borders can instantly make the outfit stand out.
View this post on InstagramAccessories that complete the lookAdd a kamarbandh to define your waist and wear traditional jewellery such as jhumkas, a matha-patti, and payals. Fresh jasmine flowers or gajra around a bun or braid will add a fragrant, graceful touch. Small details make all the difference in transforming your look from simple to divine. And most important, do not forget to do the gopi dots to cimplete the look.

Rich in antioxidants, it may lower blood pressure, support healthy blood fat levels, and promote liver health. Studies suggest it could aid weight loss, possess anti-cancer properties, and reduce bacterial growth, making it a flavorful and healthful addition to one's diet.  Hibiscus, a vibrant flowering plant, is widely known for its antioxidant-rich properties and potential health benefits. Most commonly consumed as hibiscus tea, it has been linked to weight loss, heart health, liver support, antibacterial activity, and even cancer prevention. With a tart, cranberry-like flavor, hibiscus tea can be enjoyed hot or cold and is made by steeping the dried flowers or extracts in boiling water. Among the many species, Hibiscus sabdariffa is the most popular for tea preparation. This article explores eight key benefits of hibiscus, including its nutritional properties, impact on chronic diseases, and tips for making and enjoying hibiscus tea.5 Things that show you have a healthy heartBenefits of consuming Hibiscus teaRich in antioxidantsHibiscus is packed with antioxidants, which are compounds that neutralize harmful free radicals in the body. Free radicals can cause cell damage, inflammation, and contribute to chronic diseases. As per the study published in PubMed, people with Marfan syndrome reported that hibiscus extract improved blood antioxidant levels.Animal research also demonstrated protection against cellular damage.Human and animal studies have shown that hibiscus extract increases antioxidant levels and reduces oxidative stress.May lower blood pressureOne of the most well-known benefits of hibiscus tea is its potential to reduce high blood pressure, a key risk factor for heart disease. Studies have shown that hibiscus tea may lower both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. A study with 46 participants found that consuming hibiscus tea for one month significantly reduced blood pressure compared to a placebo. As per the study published in PubMed, the health benefits of consuming hibiscus tea may help you prevent various heart issues and control blood pressure. Caution: People taking blood pressure medications should consult a doctor before consuming hibiscus tea to avoid interactions.Supports healthy blood fat levelsHibiscus tea may also improve cholesterol and triglyceride levels, which are critical for heart health. In diabetic participants, hibiscus tea increased HDL (good) cholesterol and reduced LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides.Some studies in people with metabolic syndrome showed similar results, though research in healthy populations is limited.Conflicting evidence exists, so more large-scale studies are needed.Promotes liver healthThe liver performs essential functions, including fat metabolism, protein synthesis, and detoxification. Hibiscus may support liver function by:Reducing liver fat accumulation (steatosis) in overweight individuals.Protecting liver cells from damage in animal studies.Improving markers of fatty liver disease in high-fat diet animal models.According to various studies, hibiscus tea is involved in supporting liver function. May aid weight lossHibiscus tea may support weight management and fat reduction:Studies with overweight participants consuming hibiscus extract reported decreases in body weight, body fat, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio.Animal studies suggest hibiscus may reduce fat accumulation and suppress appetite.Potential anti-cancer propertiesHibiscus is rich in polyphenols, compounds known for anticancer activity:Test-tube studies show hibiscus extract can inhibit the growth and spread of cancer cells, including breast, prostate, mouth, and skin cancers. These studies involve concentrated extracts, not the tea form, so human effects remain unproven.May reduce bacterial growthHibiscus may help combat harmful bacteria:Test-tube studies show hibiscus extract inhibits strains like E. coli, and other bacteria linked to infections such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections.Extracts have shown activity comparable to certain antibiotics in lab studies.How to prepare hibiscus tea and deliciousHibiscus tea is simple to make and enjoyable:Add dried hibiscus flowers to boiling water, steep for 5 minutes, strain, and optionally sweeten with honey or lime juice. It can be served hot or cold, offering a tart, cranberry-like flavour.Dried hibiscus is widely available in health stores and online, and tea bags provide a convenient alternative.How to add hibiscus tea into your dietHibiscus tea is simple to make and enjoyable:Preparation: Add dried hibiscus flowers to boiling water, steep for 5 minutes, strain, and optionally sweeten with honey or lime juice.Serving: It can be served hot or cold, offering a tart, cranberry-like flavor.Availability: Dried hibiscus is widely available in health stores and online, and tea bags provide a convenient alternative.Disclaimer: The information provided is for educational purposes only.

4 powerful food pairings to maximize nutrition
Enhance your nutrient absorption and gut health by pairing specific foods. Combining spinach with citrus boosts iron bioavailability, while tomatoes and olive oil maximize lycopene absorption. Garlic and honey preserve allicin's benefits, and turmeric with black pepper dramatically increases curcumin absorption, optimizing your diet's nutritional value.

Combining spinach with citrus boosts iron bioavailability, while tomatoes and olive oil maximize lycopene absorption. Garlic and honey preserve allicin's benefits, and turmeric with black pepper dramatically increases curcumin absorption, optimizing your diet's nutritional value.  Your health and wellness start with what you eat. Eating healthy is, however, not just about what you eat, but how you eat. While diet plays a crucial role in your well-being, the way you combine, prepare, and enjoy it is of paramount importance. Pairing certain foods with others can boost nutrition. Dr. Will Bulsiewicz, a leading gastroenterologist and gut health expert, has shared four powerful food pairings that will help you absorb more nutrients and improve gut health. Let’s take a look. Beat belly fat with millets: Easy breakfast ideas for quick weight lossSpinach and citrusSpinach, as we all know, is an excellent source of iron. But spinach has non-heme iron, which is a form of iron that the body cannot absorb efficiently when compared to heme iron from animal sources. So how do you increase its bioavailability? Dr. Bulsiewicz suggests adding citrus to it. “When you add a source of vitamin C to spinach, like a squeeze of lemon or some orange segments, it transforms the iron in spinach into a more bioavailable form, helping boost your energy and prevent iron deficiency,” the gut doctor explains.Tomatoes and olive oilEver wondered why your Nonna Pia adds olive oil to sauté the tomatoes? Well, it's more than just amping up the flavour. The generational knowledge passed down to her is rooted in science! Tomatoes contain lycopene, which is a fat-soluble antioxidant compound that reduces the risk of heart disease by slashing oxidative stress. “But it's not that easy to absorb until you combine it with extra virgin olive oil. The fat from the extra virgin olive oil actually helps you to get more of the lycopene from the tomatoes,” the doctor adds. Danielle Spencer’s Final Days: Her Mother Speaks on Her Gastric Cancer Battle | WATCHGarlic and honeyCombining honey with garlic may not appear very appetizing, but this pairing has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. “Garlic has these sulfur-containing compounds called allicin. Allicin is so good for us. But the problem is, it breaks down very quickly,” Dr. Bulsiewicz says. The best way to preserve the benefits of garlic is to add honey to it. “If you add raw honey, it can actually help to preserve the allicin while also offering its own benefits for your immune system and your gut health,” the doctor reveals. Turmeric and black pepperTurmeric and black pepper are indeed a match made in heaven! Turmeric contains a compound called curcumin, which has anti-inflammatory properties. However, it’s poorly absorbed on its own. “Turmeric is a wonderful spice and curry that has these powerful anti-inflammatory polyphenols called curcumin. The problem is, curcumin is not absorbed very easily. But what you could do is combine this with black pepper, which has piperine,” the doctor says. When you add black pepper to turmeric, its bioavailability increases by up to 2,000%. Yes, that’s indeed a dramatic boost. “These combinations aren’t gimmicks. They’re simple, evidence-based strategies to help you get more from the foods you already enjoy,” he adds.

Your brain are unable to get oxygen and nutrients they need from blood, and start to die within a few minutes. This can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death. Stroke can be caused by a variety of factors including High Blood Pressure, smoking, diabetes, and poor diet. However, certain foods provide cardiovascular benefits which help decrease blood pressure while fighting inflammation. The following five foods can decrease your chances of experiencing a stroke.... Take a look...2/6Leafy green vegetablesLeafy greens consisting of spinach, kale, collard greens etc provide brain and heart protection through their essential nutritional value. Your body transforms dietary nitrates from leafy greens into the beneficial compound nitric oxide. The production of nitric oxide results in blood vessel relaxation and expansion, which enhances blood flow while decreasing blood pressure levels. Stroke prevention becomes more likely through the consumption of leafy greens because high blood pressure remains a significant risk factor for stroke. The nutritional elements in these vegetables help protect blood vessels through their vitamin content and antioxidant properties, which fight dangerous molecules in the body. A person who consumes one cup of leafy greens each day will experience decreased chances of developing ischemic stroke, that occurs because of clots obstructing brain blood flow.3/6Walnuts and other nutsThe heart and brain benefits of walnuts, stem from their content of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) which belongs to the omega-3 fatty acid family. Omega-3s in the body create anti-inflammatory effects, which enhance blood circulation and decrease blood pressure levels to minimise stroke occurrence. Walnuts contain protective antioxidants which shield the body from oxidative stress, by protecting its cells and blood vessels. Scientific research indicates walnuts consumed on a regular basis, help decrease both heart disease and stroke risks. Daily consumption of a handful of walnuts along with almonds and flaxseeds, maintains your vascular system.4/6Citrus fruitsVitamin C along with potassium and flavonoids from citrus fruits like oranges, grapefruits and lemons, provide antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The nutrients in these foods work to preserve healthy blood vessels while decreasing inflammation, which leads to damage and blockages. Studies prove that eating citrus fruits regularly decreases stroke risk through improved blood vessel function, together with lowered blood pressure. Eating different citrus fruits each day through natural juice consumption provides these health benefits.5/6Fatty FishSalmon, mackerel, trout and fresh tuna among other fatty fish varieties are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. The healthy fats in these foods decrease blood pressure, while simultaneously fighting inflammation and improving cholesterol numbers through increased good HDL cholesterol and decreased bad LDL cholesterol. These beneficial outcomes decrease the probability of blood clots that block brain blood flow. Medical professionals advise patients to consume fatty fish twice to three times weekly, to prevent stroke. You can prepare these fish by grilling or baking them, and using them in salads and pasta dishes.6/6Yogurt and low-fat dairy productsYogurt, alongside other low-fat dairy products supply the body with calcium, potassium, protein and vitamin D. The body maintains healthy blood pressure through potassium, which regulates sodium levels. Healthy blood vessels together with strong bones, receive support from calcium and vitamin D. Selecting low-fat or non-fat dairy alternatives instead of full-fat versions, enables people to minimise their intake of saturated fat and cholesterol, which can negatively impact heart health.

A teenage mother, Jacklyn's resilience and love shaped Bezos' life and career, including her early investment in Amazon. She co-founded the Bezos Family Foundation, dedicated to education and philanthropy, leaving a lasting legacy of compassion and support. Source: USA Today Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos shared a heartfelt tribute following the passing of his mother, Jacklyn Gise Bezos, at the age of 78. Known for her resilience, generosity, and unwavering dedication to family, Jacklyn played a pivotal role in shaping Bezos’ personal and professional journey. She became a mother at just 17, raising her children with love and determination, and later supported Jeff’s entrepreneurial ambitions, including early investments in Amazon. Beyond her family, Jacklyn devoted herself to philanthropy and education, co-founding the Bezos Family Foundation and initiatives like Vroom and the Bezos Scholars Program, leaving a lasting impact on countless lives. Her legacy of love, perseverance, and service continues to inspire.Jeff Bezos No Longer World’s Second-Richest!Jeff Bezos pays emotional tribute to mother Jacklyn Gise Bezos battling Lewy Body DementiaJeff Bezos took to Instagram to announce the passing of his mother, describing the circumstances with heartfelt detail. Jacklyn Bezos had been battling Lewy Body Dementia, a progressive neurological disorder, since 2020.In his emotional tribute, Bezos wrote:"After a long fight with Lewy Body Dementia, she passed away today, surrounded by so many of us who loved her — her kids, grandkids, and my dad. I know she felt our love in those final moments. We were also lucky to be in her life. I hold her safe in my heart forever."Through these words, Bezos captured both the pain of loss and the enduring love he felt for his mother. He emphasized her extraordinary capacity to give selflessly and care for others, a trait that deeply influenced his personal and professional life.Jacklyn Gise Bezos’ journey as a teenage mother shaping Jeff Bezos’ lifeJacklyn Gise Bezos became a mother at just 17 years old, giving birth to Jeff Bezos while still a high school student in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Raising a child as a teenager presented immense challenges, yet she embraced motherhood with determination and strength. "That couldn't have been easy, but she made it all work," Bezos reflected in his tribute.Jacklyn’s early motherhood required balancing personal ambitions with the responsibilities of raising a child. Her resilience and dedication became a model of unconditional love, teaching her children the value of perseverance, compassion, and loyalty.How Jacklyn Gise Bezos and Miguel Bezos nurtured a strong blended familyWhen Jeff was four, Jacklyn married Miguel Bezos, a Cuban immigrant who later adopted Jeff. The blended family created a nurturing environment that allowed Jeff to grow up with a strong sense of love and support. Interestingly, Jeff only learned the truth about his biological father when he was 10 years old, which highlights the complexity and strength of family bonds nurtured by Jacklyn.Bezos often praised his mother for her ferocious love and commitment:"She pounced on the job of loving me with ferocity, brought my amazing dad onto the team a few years later, and then added my sister and brother to her list of people to love, guard, and nourish."Her love extended not only to her immediate family but to anyone she could support, reflecting her innate generosity and nurturing spirit. Jacklyn and Miguel Bezos were not just devoted parents; they were early investors in Amazon, contributing over $245,000 in 1995, a decision that could have grown into billions in today’s market. This early support played a crucial role in Jeff Bezos’ confidence to pursue ambitious ventures."When you have loving and supportive people in your life, you end up being able to take risks because you kind of know somebody's got your back," he told Mathias Döpfner in 2018.This combination of emotional support and financial belief illustrates how Jacklyn’s influence extended beyond the personal realm, directly impacting one of the most significant entrepreneurial journeys in modern history.Jeff Bezos also celebrated his mother publicly through Blue Origin, his aerospace company. In 2020, he named a rocket recovery ship after her:"New Glenn's first stage will come home to the Jacklyn after every flight. It couldn't be more appropriately named — Mom has always given us the best place and best heart to come home to." This act symbolised the safe, nurturing environment she provided—a home base of love and support that enabled her children to pursue extraordinary ambitions.Jacklyn Gise Bezos’ lifelong commitment to education and philanthropyJacklyn Gise Bezos was a lifelong advocate for education. Despite early obstacles due to teenage pregnancy, she persisted and graduated from high school, later earning a Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology at the age of 45. Her dedication to learning served as an inspiration for her children and countless others.In 2000, Jacklyn and Miguel co-founded the Bezos Family Foundation, through which she focused on several initiatives:Vroom: A program distributing research-based tools to support early brain development in children.Bezos Scholars Program: Empowering students across the United States and Africa with educational opportunities and leadership training.Her philanthropic work demonstrates a lifelong commitment to uplifting communities, fostering learning, and investing in the potential of future generations.Get the latest lifestyle updates on Times of India, along with Happy Independence Day wishes, messages, and quotes !About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

THESE foods and beverages can starve cancer
Dr. William Li highlights the significance of dietary choices in cancer prevention, emphasizing that certain foods can starve cancer cells. Coffee, tea, Brassica vegetables, beans, legumes, and omega-3-rich seafood are recommended for their anti-inflammatory and blood supply-cutting properties. Incorporating these foods into the diet may lower the risk of developing various cancers, including colorectal cancer.

Dr. William Li highlights the significance of dietary choices in cancer prevention, emphasizing that certain foods can starve cancer cells. Coffee, tea, Brassica vegetables, beans, legumes, and omega-3-rich seafood are recommended for their anti-inflammatory and blood supply-cutting properties. Incorporating these foods into the diet may lower the risk of developing various cancers, including colorectal cancer. Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. In 2020, cancer led to nearly 10 million deaths, which is one in six deaths, according to the World Health Organisation. While several factors increase the risk of cancer, the WHO says, 30% and 50% of cancers are preventable. One lifestyle change that can reduce the risk of cancer, is eating the right foods. Dr. William Li is a world-renowned physician and author known for revolutionary theories of disease prevention through the power of eating right, has shared a list of foods that can starve cancer. Take a look. Want to live longer? Science says eating more protein might be the answerAdd coffee and tea to the menu Yes, that’s right, popular beverages, coffee and tea, do more than just wake you up. Coffee contains chlorogenic acid, which lowers inflammation and starves the cancer cells. Tea, especially green tea, contains polyphenols called catechins, which, according to Dr. Li, cut off the blood supply to cancer. “For example, the Shanghai Women’s Health Study followed 69,000 women and found that those who drank tea at least 3 times per week had a 37% reduction in the risk for colon cancer, compared to women who didn’t drink green tea. How you steep your tea can make a difference. The more you steep, the more natural cancer-fighting substances from the tea leaves are released into your cup!” Dr. Li said in his blog. Brassica vegetablesLoad your plate with vegetables from the Brassica genus within the Brassicaceae family. According to Dr. Li, Brassica vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, kale, and arugula are potent cancer-fighting foods. These vegetables contain isothiocyanates, specifically sulforaphanes, which are natural chemicals that can cut off the blood supply feeding cancer and also lower inflammation.Eat your beansDr. Li also stressed the importance of adding beans and legumes to your diet. They are an excellent way to starve cancer cells. Beans and legumes, such as white beans, black beans, pinto beans, chickpeas, soybeans and edamame, are rich in dietary fiber, which has been linked to a lower risk of colorectal cancer.Omega-3s for the winImagine eating delectable fish recipes to beat cancer. Sounds like a dream, right? Dr. Li emphasizes the importance of adding seafood to the diet. Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, seafood is linked to lower inflammation. “We used to think it was only salmon or lower on the food chain like anchovies and sardines, mackerel, but in fact, even cod and halibut and even shrimp and shellfish like mussels and clams, they also have healthy omega-3s,” he said. “All of this can contribute to lowering your risk of developing cancers, including colorectal cancer,” he adds. Trump’s Niece Drops Health Bombshell: 3 Troubling Signs About President's Health | WATCHAnother food that can help curb cancer is olive oil. “Extra virgin olive oil contains polyphenols like hydroxytyrosol and oleocanthal. Those also lower inflammation and have cancer-starving properties as well,” he said.

She became a mother at 17 and raised Jeff, later building a close-knit family with her husband, Miguel "Mike" Bezos.  Jacklyn “Jackie” Gise Bezos, matriarch of the Bezos family and Jeff Bezos's loving mum, passed away on August 14, 2025, at the age of 78. She died peacefully at her home in Miami, surrounded by family, after a long, courageous fight with Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) that she’d been battling since 2020.Jackie’s journey into motherhood began early—she became a mum at just 17, giving birth to Jeff in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Despite all odds, she raised him on her own after her first marriage ended, and later married Miguel “Mike” Bezos in 1968, who became not just her partner but also Jeff’s adoptive dad. Together they built a close-knit family that included Jeff’s siblings Christina and Mark.Jeff Bezos No Longer World’s Second-Richest!Heartfelt tributeJeff has posted a heartfelt tribute on social media for his mother. "Her adulthood started a little bit early when she became my mom at the tender age of 17. That couldn’t have been easy, but she made it all work. She pounced on the job of loving me with ferocity, brought my amazing dad onto the team a few years later, and then added my sister and brother to her list of people to love, guard, and nourish. For the rest of her life, that list of people to love never stopped growing. She always gave so much more than she ever asked for," he writes. "After a long fight with Lewy Body Dementia, she passed away today, surrounded by so many of us who loved her — her kids, grandkids, and my dad. I know she felt our love in those final moments. We were all so lucky to be in her life. I hold her safe in my heart forever," he adds.Lewy Body Dementia: What is it?Lewy Body Dementia is a brain disorder that slowly chips away at a person’s memory, thinking skills, movement, and even mood. It’s actually the second most common type of progressive dementia after Alzheimer’s, but it often flies under the radar because its symptoms can look like a mix of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.The “Lewy bodies” in the name are tiny, abnormal protein clumps (called alpha-synuclein) that build up in brain cells. Imagine little unwanted “globs” in your brain’s control center—messing with how your neurons talk to each other. Over time, these globs cause brain cells to stop working properly and eventually die off.LBD can feel like a moving target. Symptoms often change from day to day, or even within the same day. Some of the most common signs are:Memory & thinking problems – kind of like Alzheimer’s, but sometimes less obvious in the very beginning.Hallucinations – people may see things that aren’t there, and these can be vivid and detailed.Movement issues – slow walking, stiffness, tremors—very Parkinson’s-like.Sleep changes – one common thing is “acting out” dreams (called REM sleep behavior disorder), where people physically move or talk in their sleep.Alertness swings – one hour someone might be sharp and chatty, and the next they seem confused or out of it.Because it blends symptoms from different brain disorders, LBD is often misdiagnosed—and getting the right diagnosis is key for proper care.Right now, there’s no cure for Lewy Body Dementia. Doctors can help manage symptoms with a mix of medications, lifestyle adjustments, and support therapies (like physical or occupational therapy). But here’s the kicker—some common Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s drugs can actually make certain LBD symptoms worse, so treatment has to be extra carefully managed. It usually shows up in people over 50 (most often in their 70s or 80s), and both men and women can get it. It’s not rare—experts estimate it affects about 1.4 million people in the US alone, and similar rates in Canada and the UK.Jackie was diagnosed in 2020 and faced the disease head-on with dignity and courage—having her devoted husband Mike by her side at every step.She was a real-life superstar—raising kids, going back to school in her mid-40s to earn a psychology degree, all while working and juggling life’s curveballs. Her fierce spirit didn’t stop there—Jackie helped launch Amazon in 1995 with a game-changing early investment (around $245–250 k), a move that would go on to shape history.On top of that, her heart for others ran deep. In 2000, she co-founded the Bezos Family Foundation, championing initiatives like Vroom (brain-science-based parenting tools) and the Bezos Scholars Program (supporting youth both in North America and Africa). Her dedication to education, empathy, and community was palpable every step of the way.Her philanthropic impact reached even further—Jackie and Mike backed groundbreaking immunotherapy cancer research through partnerships with Seattle’s Fred Hutch Cancer Center, including a massive $710 million gift in 2022 that was one of the largest donations the center had ever seen.Jacklyn “Jackie” Gise Bezos lived a life that was nothing short of extraordinary. She was a trailblazer, a nurturer, a lifelong learner, and a visionary who invested not just in her son’s dreams but also in the futures of countless others. Her fierce love for family, coupled with her tireless work in education and healthcare, leaves an imprint that will last for generations.Get the latest lifestyle updates on Times of India, along with Happy Independence Day wishes, messages, and quotes !About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

4 effective ways to lower cholesterol naturally
Managing cholesterol is vital for heart health. Limiting trans fats found in processed foods and incorporating monounsaturated fats from avocados, olive oil, and nuts can help. Regular exercise, aiming for at least 150 minutes of moderate activity weekly, is also crucial. Maintaining a healthy weight through diet and exercise further supports healthy cholesterol levels.

Limiting trans fats found in processed foods and incorporating monounsaturated fats from avocados, olive oil, and nuts can help. Regular exercise, aiming for at least 150 minutes of moderate activity weekly, is also crucial. Maintaining a healthy weight through diet and exercise further supports healthy cholesterol levels.  High cholesterol is a condition in which you have too much of a fatty substance called cholesterol in your blood. Elevated levels of LDL 'bad' cholesterol increase the risk of buildup of plaque in arteries, which can lead to heart disease and stroke. Keeping the cholesterol levels in check is crucial. Though medications can help, taking certain steps at home can help manage cholesterol levels. Take a look. Beat belly fat with millets: Easy breakfast ideas for quick weight lossKeep trans fat at bayTrans fats, also known as trans unsaturated fatty acids, are unsaturated fats that naturally occur in foods or are modified by a process called hydrogenation. It is an unhealthy fat found in processed foods, fried items, and baked goods. Consuming this trans fat will elevate the bad cholesterol and lower your good cholesterol (HDL). How to keep them at bay? Avoid foods like margarine, pastries, baked goods, some microwaveable popcorn, fried fast food, pizzas, and nondairy coffee creamer.Say ‘Yes’ to monounsaturated fatsNot all fats are the same. One of the best ways to lower cholesterol is to incorporate more monounsaturated fats in your diet. Think of eating avocados, olive oil, nuts such as almonds, cashews, and pecans, and olives. These are healthy fats that can lower bad cholesterol and also reduce your risk of heart disease. A 2022 study has found that eating one avocado a day for six months can reduce unhealthy cholesterol levels. They found that consuming avocados daily resulted in total cholesterol decreasing 2.9 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) and LDL cholesterol decreasing 2.5 mg/dL.Exercise regularlyStaying active is essential in keeping cholesterol levels in check. Regular exercise is an effective way to improve cholesterol levels. Studies have consistently shown that physical activity helps raise HDL while lowering LDL and triglycerides. Aim to get at least 150 minutes of moderate to intense aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous activity in a week. This could be walking, swimming, jogging, or cycling. You can also engage in intense physical activity such as HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training). Adjust your exercise intensity based on your health and fitness levels. Maintain a healthy weightIt is important to maintain a healthy weight. This is not about fitting into a conventional beauty standard, but being healthy. Obesity can negatively affect cholesterol levels. Studies have consistently shown that overweight and obesity raise levels of LDL ‘bad’ cholesterol. Even losing 5 to 10 percent of body weight can significantly lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Focus on eating a well-balanced and nutritious diet, along with exercise, to maintain a healthy weight.

5 signs your body needs more nutrients
The human body signals nutrient deficiencies. Dr. Saurabh Sethi highlights early detection. Brittle nails indicate protein or iron issues. Eyelid twitching suggests magnesium deficiency. Clicking joints may warn of vitamin D3 or calcium shortage. Premature graying links to vitamin B12 or copper problems. Easy bruising signals vitamin C or K1 deficiency. Addressing these signs prevents bigger health problems.

Eyelid twitching suggests magnesium deficiency. Clicking joints may warn of vitamin D3 or calcium shortage. Premature graying links to vitamin B12 or copper problems. Easy bruising signals vitamin C or K1 deficiency. Addressing these signs prevents bigger health problems.  The human body is more miraculous than we understand. When an illness or deficiency sneaks in, it gives you signs. These signs appear even before they show up in the lab tests. Your body needs essential vitamins and minerals to function properly. But when it falls short, the body sends signals. These signs could be subtle and easy to dismiss. Dr. Saurabh Sethi, a California-based gastroenterologist, has now emphasized the importance of catching these signs early and correcting them before they lead to bigger health issues.Brittle nailsIf someone has a problem with breaking nails or strange ridges, the body might be craving protein or iron. Protein is essential for nail strength, and iron helps carry oxygen to the nail beds. Low iron levels can leave the nails weak and pale. Time to load up on eggs, spinach, nuts, and lean meats!  How strong are your nails? Well, not the fake ones, your real ones. Well, the strength of your nails can really tell a lot about your health. Dr. Sethi notes that brittle nails are a sign of protein and iron deficiency in your diet. If your nails are breaking very often and are thin, it is important to look into it. Iron plays a crucial role in helping deliver oxygen to cells. Protein, on the other hand, is the building block for keratin, the main component of nails. Eyelids or lid twitchingFrequent muscle cramps, especially in the legs, can be another indicator of kidney disease. This happens due to: Imbalances in key minerals like calcium, phosphorus, and potassium. Poor regulation of electrolytes by the kidneys, leading to sudden cramps and muscle pain.While dehydration can also cause cramps, persistent muscle spasms might suggest an underlying kidney issue.If you complain about a sudden spasm in your leg, it could be more than fatigue. A lack of adequate magnesium in your body can lead to muscle twitches. Similarly, the involuntary eyelid twitching is also a sign of magnesium deficiency. Magnesium has a pivotal role in transmitting nerve impulses and supporting muscle function.Clicking sound at the joints Do you hear a clicking sound from your knees when you sit or rise from a seated position? Well, it is not nothing. Dr. Sethi says that this could be a warning sign of vitamin D3 or calcium deficiency. These nutrients are essential for bone density and joint health. A deficiency can cause this audible sound in the joints.Premature grayingAre you struggling with premature graying? Well, genetics does play a major role in hair colour, however, early graying may also be linked to nutrient deficiencies. Dr. Sethi explains that premature graying could be due to vitamin B12 or copper deficiency. “Vitamin B12 is crucial for RBC production and oxygen transport at the hair follicles. This could also be a sign of copper deficiency, which is responsible for melanin production, imparting color to your hair,” he adds. Nutrient Power: How Vitamins Affect Hair Growth, Skin, and Nail HealthEasy bruisingDo you get hurt very easily? If you notice bruises very often on your body, it is a crucial sign of nutrient deficiency. This is a sign that your body may be low in vitamin C or vitamin K1. Vitamin C is responsible for collagen formation, which keeps blood vessels strong, while vitamin K1 plays a key role in blood clotting.Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

Consider natural supplements. Creatine enhances strength. Betaine improves endurance. Carnitine aids energy production and recovery. BCAAs prevent muscle breakdown. Whey protein supports muscle repair and growth. These supplements, combined with training and diet, can give you an edge. Always consult a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement.  When it comes to building muscle and speeding up recovery, most people focus on training programs and diet plans. But certain naturally occurring compounds, many of which are already present in foods and in your body, can give your fitness progress an extra edge. While these supplements are often manufactured in labs for convenience and purity, they are chemically identical to what occurs in nature. Backed by strong research, they can improve strength, endurance, recovery, and overall performance when combined with consistent training, proper nutrition, and adequate rest. Here are five of the most effective natural supplements to consider for maximizing results safely.1. Creatine Creatine is one of the most researched and effective supplements for enhancing strength and performance. It occurs naturally in foods such as chicken and certain types of fish like salmon, tuna, and cod. The body also produces small amounts from amino acids. Studies highlight Creatine’s main role is to replenish ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the primary energy currency your muscles use for short bursts of high-intensity activity such as sprinting, heavy lifting, or explosive movements. Supplementing with creatine monohydrate has been shown to increase muscle strength, improve workout capacity, and promote lean muscle growth over time. It can also help muscles store more water, giving them a fuller look and potentially aiding recovery.2. BetaineBetaine, also known as trimethylglycine, is found naturally in beets, spinach, quinoa, sweet potatoes, wheat bran, and shellfish. It plays a key role in methylation, a biochemical process important for muscle function and protein synthesis. Studies suggest betaine can improve muscle endurance, hydration, and overall power output during training. Its osmolyte properties help cells maintain fluid balance under stress, which is particularly useful during long or intense workouts. Athletes who supplement with betaine may notice improvements in performance metrics like sprint speed, rep volume, and reduced fatigue between sets.3. CarnitineCarnitine is a compound involved in transporting fatty acids into your cells’ mitochondria, where they are burned for energy. It’s naturally abundant in red meat, poultry, dairy, avocado, asparagus, and whole milk. While your body synthesizes it from lysine and methionine (two amino acids), supplementing can help optimize energy production, especially for endurance exercise. Research has also linked carnitine to reduced muscle soreness, faster recovery after intense training, and improved oxygen delivery to muscles. Some athletes use L-carnitine L-tartrate, a specific form shown to benefit recovery from resistance training.4. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs)BCAAs, which include leucine, isoleucine, and valine, are essential amino acids found in high-protein foods such as dairy, soybeans, lentils, nuts, eggs, chicken, and seeds. These amino acids are unique because they can be directly used by muscles for energy during exercise, helping to prevent muscle breakdown. Leucine in particular acts as a signal to start muscle protein synthesis, the process of building new muscle tissue. Research suggests Supplemental BCAAs may help reduce fatigue during long workouts, decrease muscle soreness, and support recovery, especially if your diet is low in protein or you are training in a fasted state.5. Whey proteinWhey protein is a complete, fast-digesting protein derived from milk during the cheese-making process. It is rich in all essential amino acids, particularly leucine, which triggers muscle growth. Foods that naturally contain whey include milk, yogurt, cheese, and other dairy products, although in smaller amounts compared to a concentrated supplement. According to studies whey protein shakes are a convenient way to ensure your muscles get the nutrients they need for repair right after training. Beyond muscle growth, whey can also help maintain lean mass during fat loss phases, support immune function, and improve satiety.Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.

Cancerous lumps often feel hard with uneven edges. They usually stay fixed under the skin and are often painless. Rapid growth and unexplained weight loss are warning signs. Lumps can appear in the breast, neck, or groin. See a doctor for any hard, fixed, or growing lump. Early diagnosis is key for better treatment outcomes.  Finding a lump on your body can be worrying, but it’s important to know how to identify if it might be cancerous. Most lumps are benign and harmless, but cancerous lumps often have specific features. They tend to feel hard or firm, have irregular or uneven edges, and are usually fixed or immobile under the skin. Unlike painful lumps caused by infections, cancerous lumps are often painless and persistent. Rapid growth, noticeable changes in texture, persistence beyond two weeks, and associated symptoms like unexplained weight loss, night sweats, or fatigue are warning signs. Early medical assessment is vital for proper diagnosis and timely treatment.What is a cancerous lump and how do they feelAccording to a study published in Bowen Icon Cancer Center, a cancerous lump is an abnormal mass formed by uncontrolled cell growth that can invade surrounding tissues. These lumps can arise in different tissues and organs and often require urgent medical attention.Understanding the texture and feel of lumps can provide important clues:Hard or firm: Cancerous lumps often feel much harder or firmer than benign lumps. They may feel like a solid mass under the skin.Irregular surface: Unlike smooth benign lumps such as cysts or lipomas, cancerous lumps tend to have an irregular, uneven, or bumpy surface.Fixed in place: Cancerous lumps often feel fixed or immobile because they can adhere to the skin, muscle, or other tissues. Benign lumps typically move slightly when pressed.Non-tender or painless: Many cancerous lumps do not cause pain, especially early on. Pain is more commonly associated with infections, inflammation, or trauma.How large can a cancerous lump becomeA cancerous lump often begins as a small growth, sometimes only a few millimeters across. As the cancer develops, the lump can gradually increase in size. When it grows to 1 to 2 centimeters or larger, it is usually a sign that medical evaluation is necessary. Without treatment, the lump may expand rapidly, potentially causing more serious health issues. This highlights the importance of early detection and prompt medical attention to improve outcomes, prevent spread, and enhance treatment effectiveness.Common locations for cancerous lumpsCancerous lumps can appear anywhere, but some locations are more common and warrant particular attention:1. BreastBreast lumps are common and most are benign. However, any new, hard, or irregular lump in the breast should be examined urgently.Men can also develop breast lumps, though breast cancer in men is rare.2. Neck and throatPersistent swollen lymph nodes in the neck may indicate lymphoma or metastasis from other cancers.Hard lumps in the thyroid gland could suggest thyroid cancer.3. GroinLumps here may be swollen lymph nodes. Hard, fixed lumps could signal lymphoma or other cancers.4. SkinAny new, changing, or unusual skin lumps, nodules, or growths should be assessed.Skin cancers such as melanoma may present as irregular lumps that change colour or bleed.5. Other areasCancerous lumps can also occur in internal organs but are not usually palpable unless advanced.Soft tissue sarcomas can cause deep lumps in muscles or fat.Warning signs of cancerous lumpsLook out for the following red flags:Lump feels very hard or firm.Lump has an irregular shape or uneven borders.Lump is fixed and doesn’t move when pressed.Lump is growing rapidly or changing over weeks.Lump is painless or causing unexplained symptoms.Skin changes over the lump, such as redness, ulceration, or bleeding.Associated systemic symptoms like unexplained weight loss, fever, night sweats, or fatigue.When to see a doctorIt’s important to get a medical opinion if you notice:Any lump that is hard, fixed, or irregular.A lump growing in size or not disappearing after two weeks.Lumps accompanied by general symptoms like weight loss or fever.Any lump that causes concern or anxiety.Early diagnosis and treatment are critical for the best outcomes.Diagnosis and treatmentYour doctor will usually start by examining the lump and asking about its duration, any associated symptoms, and your medical history. Sometimes, they may recommend:Ultrasound or other imaging scans.Blood tests.Biopsy or fine needle aspiration for tissue sampling.Treatment depends on the cause, many lumps need no treatment, while others may require antibiotics, minor surgery, or specialist referral.Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.

The virus infects neurons, triggering neuroinflammation and disrupting brain function, influencing cognition and emotional regulation. Understanding this broader impact is crucial for developing comprehensive treatment strategies and improving the quality of life for affected individuals.  Herpes is a common viral infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), which primarily affects the skin, mouth, and genital regions. While most people associate herpes with visible sores or occasional flare-ups, the virus has a unique ability to remain dormant in nerve cells and reactivate unpredictably, often triggered by stress, illness, or a weakened immune system. This ability to lie hidden makes herpes a persistent and sometimes underestimated health concern.Beyond the more familiar physical symptoms, recent research done by Frontiers in Microbiology, WHO and studies published in NIH has uncovered a surprising and less-discussed dimension of herpes: its potential impact on neurological and psychological health. In particular, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) has been linked to mood disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder. The virus can infect neurons and trigger neuroinflammation, disrupting normal brain function and potentially influencing cognition, emotional regulation, and overall mental well-being.These findings underscore the need for broader awareness of herpes beyond its skin-related manifestations. Understanding the virus’s full spectrum of effects can help medical professionals develop targeted treatment strategies, including antiviral therapies and interventions to support neurological and psychological health. For individuals living with herpes, early detection, regular monitoring, and comprehensive care can significantly improve quality of life and reduce the risk of complications.Understanding herpes virus and its neurological impactHuman herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is a strain of the herpes virus that can infect a variety of cells, including neurons in the brain. Research published in Frontiers in Microbiology demonstrates that HHV-6 has the ability to target Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, which play a vital role in motor control, coordination, and cognitive functions. Infection of these neurons can interfere with normal brain activity, potentially leading to cognitive disturbances, impaired motor skills, and an increased risk of mood disorders such as depression or bipolar disorder.These findings highlight that herpes is far more than a skin or genital infection, it can have profound effects on neurological and psychological health. Understanding the virus’s broader impact is crucial for developing effective treatment strategies, early detection protocols, and preventive measures. By recognizing the full scope of HHV-6’s potential effects on the brain, medical professionals and patients alike can adopt more comprehensive approaches to managing and mitigating its long-term consequences.How herpes virus triggers neuroinflammation in mood disordersOne of the primary ways the herpes virus can impact mental health is through neuroinflammation according to a study in NIH. When herpes infects neurons, it can trigger an inflammatory response in the brain, interfering with normal neural signaling and communication. This virus-induced inflammation has been linked to psychiatric conditions, including depression, bipolar disorder, and cognitive disturbances.Researchers are actively investigating how controlling or reducing neuroinflammation could help mitigate the neurological and psychological effects of herpes. By combining antiviral therapies with strategies aimed at calming inflammation in the brain, medical professionals may be able to offer a dual approach to treatment, addressing both the viral activity and its neurological consequences. This integrated perspective not only broadens understanding of herpes beyond its physical symptoms but also opens new avenues for improving mental health outcomes in affected individuals.Herpes virus, genetics, and environmental factorsMood disorders are complex conditions shaped by a combination of genetic predispositions and environmental influences. Among these environmental factors, herpes virus can act as a trigger, potentially worsening psychiatric symptoms in individuals who have a genetic vulnerability. According to a study published in NIH, by infecting neurons and promoting neuroinflammation, herpes may amplify existing risks for conditions such as depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety.Recognizing herpes as a contributing factor in mental health challenges allows researchers and clinicians to develop more holistic treatment approaches. These strategies aim not only to control viral activity but also to address its psychological and neurological consequences. Understanding the interplay between genetic susceptibility and viral triggers can lead to more personalized therapies, early interventions, and improved outcomes for individuals affected by both herpes and mood disorders.Emerging herpes treatments and researchWhile antiviral medications like acyclovir and valacyclovir effectively manage herpes outbreaks according to WHO, emerging research is exploring therapies that could address herpes’ neurological effects. Key areas include:Targeted antiviral therapies: Personalized regimens to reduce viral reactivation and minimize neuroinflammation.Herpes vaccines: Early-stage research aims to prevent both initial infection and recurring outbreaks.Anti-inflammatory interventions: Medications or lifestyle strategies to reduce herpes-related brain inflammation.These approaches may not only control herpes physically but also alleviate associated mood disturbances. Reducing stigma around herpes and mental healthStigma surrounding herpes often intensifies its psychological impact. Many individuals living with the virus experience feelings of shame, embarrassment, or social anxiety, which can prevent them from seeking timely medical care. This reluctance not only exacerbates mood disorders such as depression and anxiety but also reduces adherence to treatment, potentially worsening physical and mental health outcomes.Raising public awareness about herpes, providing accurate sexual health education, and fostering open, nonjudgmental conversations about the infection can play a critical role in reducing stigma. When people feel informed and supported, they are more likely to seek medical advice, adhere to treatment plans, and manage both the physical and psychological effects of the virus. Addressing stigma is therefore essential for improving mental health outcomes, promoting overall well-being, and empowering individuals to lead confident, healthy lives despite a herpes diagnosis.Herpes is more than a virus causing visible outbreaks; it has the potential to affect neurological and mental health through infection and inflammation of the brain. By recognizing herpes as a factor in mood disorders like depression and bipolar disorder, healthcare providers and patients can adopt strategies that combine antiviral treatment, mental health support, and lifestyle interventions. Increasing awareness, reducing stigma, and advancing research are key to helping those affected by herpes live healthier, more confident lives.Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

The National Family Health Survey reveals a high prevalence, necessitating targeted interventions. Government initiatives like Anemia Mukt Bharat and POSHAN Abhiyaan aim to combat this through supplementation, improved nutrition, and awareness campaigns.  Anemia, a condition marked by a shortage of healthy red blood cells necessary to carry adequate oxygen to the body’s tissues, has traditionally been seen as a challenge primarily affecting rural India. However, recent data shows a worrying shift: urban women are now increasingly experiencing this silent health crisis. Despite better access to healthcare, improved sanitation, and higher living standards, factors such as poor dietary choices, irregular meal patterns, busy lifestyles, and socio-economic pressures are contributing to the rising prevalence of anemia in city settings.Iron deficiency, vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, and inadequate consumption of nutrient-rich foods like leafy greens, pulses, and lean proteins are common culprits. Additionally, lifestyle factors including stress, irregular sleep, and high consumption of processed foods can exacerbate the problem. The growing incidence of anemia among urban women according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and a survey conducted by The National Family Health Survey highlights the need for greater awareness, proactive screening, and nutrition-focused interventions to protect their health, productivity, and overall well-being.Understanding anemia: A growing concern for urban womenAnemia is most commonly caused by iron deficiency, but insufficient levels of other essential nutrients like folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin A also contribute significantly to the condition. According to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, anemia occurs when hemoglobin levels in the blood are too low, reducing its capacity to transport oxygen to vital organs and tissues. This oxygen shortage can lead to fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and compromised immune function.In addition to nutritional deficiencies, factors such as menstrual blood loss, pregnancy, chronic illnesses, and poor dietary diversity can exacerbate anemia, particularly among women. Understanding the multifactorial causes of anemia is critical for prevention, timely diagnosis, and effective treatment strategies, especially in urban populations where lifestyle and dietary habits may increase vulnerability.Alarming statistics: The prevalence of anemia in urban IndiaThe National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), conducted between 2019 and 2021, reveals a concerning trend: 57% of Indian women aged 15–49 years are anemic, compared to just 25% of men in the same age group. This stark gender disparity highlights how women, particularly of reproductive age, are disproportionately affected by anemia due to factors such as menstrual blood loss, pregnancy, and nutritional deficiencies. The data underscores the urgent need for targeted interventions, including nutrition education, iron and vitamin supplementation, and lifestyle modifications.Addressing anemia among women is not only critical for their own health but also has broader implications for family well-being and community development. Adequate hemoglobin levels support energy, cognitive function, and immunity, enabling women to lead productive lives. Without focused measures, the high prevalence of anemia can perpetuate cycles of poor health, reduced work capacity, and intergenerational nutritional challenges, making it a pressing public health concern that demands immediate attention.Factors contributing to anemia among urban womenDietary habitsUrban diets often include a high intake of processed foods, leading to nutritional deficiencies. The consumption of dark green leafy vegetables, rich in iron, remains suboptimal among urban women.Lifestyle choicesSedentary lifestyles and increased stress levels can exacerbate health issues, including anemia. The lack of physical activity and poor dietary choices contribute to the condition.Socio-Economic factorsWomen from lower socio-economic backgrounds are more susceptible to anemia. Limited access to nutritious food and healthcare services increases the risk.Educational levelsLower levels of education are associated with higher rates of anemia. Educated women are more likely to be aware of nutritional needs and health services.Government initiatives to combat anemiaThe Indian government has launched several initiatives to address anemia:Anemia Mukt Bharat (AMB) Program: This program focuses on reducing anemia through iron and folic acid supplementation, deworming, and improving dietary practices.POSHAN Abhiyaan: A national mission to improve nutritional outcomes for children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.School Health Program: Aimed at screening and treating anemia among school-going children and adolescents.Anemia among urban women in India is a complex and multifaceted health issue that demands comprehensive, targeted strategies. Public health campaigns play a crucial role in raising awareness about the causes, risks, and prevention of anemia, while regular health screenings help identify cases early, allowing timely intervention. Improving dietary habits by promoting iron-rich foods, fortified products, and balanced nutrition is essential for preventing nutrient deficiencies that contribute to anemia.In addition, lifestyle modifications, such as stress management, adequate sleep, and education on healthy eating practices, can further support women’s overall well-being. Collaboration between healthcare providers, government programs, and community organizations is vital to ensure these interventions reach those most at risk. By addressing these factors holistically, India can significantly reduce anemia prevalence, empowering urban women to lead healthier, more productive lives and strengthening the health of entire communities.Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Changes in lip color, texture, or moisture can signal potential health concerns like nutritional deficiencies, infections, or systemic conditions. Maintaining hydration, a nutrient-rich diet, and protective habits are crucial for detecting problems early and supporting both lip health and overall wellness.  Our lips are not just a prominent facial feature—they serve as a visible indicator of overall health. Normally, healthy lips appear soft, smooth, and pink, reflecting proper hydration and nutrition. Changes in their color, texture, or moisture levels can signal potential health concerns, ranging from nutritional deficiencies and dehydration to infections or systemic conditions. Studies and reputable health sources emphasise that lips often reveal early warning signs before other symptoms appear, making them a valuable tool for monitoring well-being. Regularly observing the condition of your lips, maintaining proper hydration, and ensuring a nutrient-rich diet can help detect problems early and support both lip health and overall wellness.How lips indicate internal health problemsAccording to health organisations, the lips, like skin and nails, provide visible cues about the body’s internal state. Changes in lip appearance—such as paleness, dryness, swelling, or unusual pigmentation—may reflect issues with circulation, hydration, nutrient levels, or immune function.Your lips are a subtle but powerful indicator of internal health. From dryness and cracking to color changes or swelling, these signs may reveal nutritional deficiencies, infections, or systemic conditions. By observing your lips, maintaining hydration, practicing good hygiene, and supporting overall health through nutrition, you can protect both your lips and your well-being.A study published in the National Library of Medicine, emphasises that lip color and texture are closely linked to cardiovascular, respiratory, and nutritional health, making them important indicators to monitor.Common warning signs from your lipsPale or bluish lipsPale or bluish lips may indicate low oxygen levels in the blood, potentially linked to anemia, respiratory problems, or poor circulation. As reported, persistent paleness can signal an underlying deficiency in red blood cells or cardiovascular issues.Dry and chapped lipsDry, cracked, or chapped lips are common in cold or dry climates. However, persistent dryness can also suggest dehydration, vitamin deficiencies (especially B vitamins), or malnutrition. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), lips are highly sensitive to hydration and nutrient levels, so ongoing dryness should be investigated.Swollen lipsLip swelling can occur due to allergic reactions, infections, or inflammatory conditions. Resources like the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) highlight that sudden or recurrent swelling may require medical attention to rule out conditions like angioedema or allergic responses.Sores or lesionsSores, blisters, or lesions may result from viral infections such as cold sores (herpes simplex virus) or canker sores. Studies indicate that recurrent lesions can affect quality of life and may signal immune system weakness or chronic stress.Cracks at the corners of the mouthCracks or splits at the corners of the lips—a condition called angular cheilitis—are linked to iron or B-vitamin deficiencies or fungal infections. As health sources note that improving nutrition and maintaining lip hygiene can prevent these painful cracks.Discoloration or unusual pigmentationDark spots or unusual pigmentation on the lips may indicate hormonal imbalances, vitamin deficiencies, or reactions to medications. Research shows that lip discoloration can sometimes signal underlying systemic issues, making observation important for early detection.Prevention tips to maintain healthy lipsMaintaining healthy lips involves both lifestyle habits and attention to overall health. Health studies and websites provide these evidence-based tips:Stay hydratedDrinking sufficient water is essential for lip moisture. The NIH recommends balancing hydration throughout the day, as lips are among the first areas to show dehydration.Use lip protectionApplying a lip balm with SPF can prevent sun damage, dryness, and irritation. The AAD highlights that protecting lips from UV exposure reduces the risk of long-term damage and discoloration.Avoid licking lipsSaliva evaporates quickly, leaving lips drier than before. Avoiding excessive lip licking helps maintain moisture and prevents chapping.Eat a nutrient-rich dietA diet rich in iron, vitamins B2, B3, B6, and B12 supports healthy lips. Health studies show that deficiencies in these nutrients often manifest first in skin and lip changes.Protect lips from extreme weatherWind, cold, and dry climates can damage lips. Covering lips with scarves, masks, or moisturizers reduces the impact of environmental stressors.Identify allergensAvoid substances that trigger lip swelling or irritation, such as certain cosmetics or foods. Studies on contact dermatitis indicate that early avoidance reduces recurring inflammation.Maintain hygieneDo not share lip products such as balms or lipsticks, as this can transmit infections.

Reddit rumours fuel excitement among Indian fans – Here’s what we knowLollapalooza India 2026 might be shaping up to be its biggest edition yet. Rumours suggest global icons Billie Eilish and Linkin Park could headline, alongside major acts from America and India. Talks are ongoing with major alternative metal bands and EDM artists, but nothing has been officially confirmed.Nillohit BagchiUpdated: Aug 14, 2025, 10:57 IST  4  min read  The buzz around Lollapalooza India 2026 has officially begun, and if the rumours are true, fans are in for a massive treat. Insider chatter and Reddit claims suggest Billie Eilish and Linkin Park have already signed contracts for headline performances. While the organisers have yet to confirm, the news has set social media on fire, with fans speculating on what could be one of the most diverse and high-energy festival lineups in recent memory. Alongside these global stars, several other big names are reportedly in talks, making the Lollapalooza 2026 edition a highly anticipated event for music lovers in India and beyond.Rumour mill: Billie Eilish and Linkin Park to take centre stage in Lollapalooza 2026? According to insiders in Lollapalooza India’s Reddit subreddit (r/lollapaloozaind), Billie Eilish, fresh off her latest world tour, Hit Me Hard and Soft, could bring her signature mix of haunting vocals and electrifying stage presence to the festival.

The rock band’s involvement is equally exciting, marking what could be a rare and emotional live set for the legendary rock band. If confirmed, their inclusion would give Lollapalooza India a unique blend of alternative, pop, rock, and metal energy.
 Linkin Park may co-headline Lollapalooza 2026 India (Credits: X/@linkinpark)Sharing alleged inside information about Billie and Linkin Park’s rumoured sets, one Reddit user wrote, “I can confirm the following: Billie Eilish (for headline slot), Linkin Park, M.I.A., Raja Kumari, Raftaar have signed contracts officially. They are negotiating with My Chemical Romance, but the band wants more of a payout, which would affect the festival budget. David Guetta is in talks, but nothing has been signed yet, and again, like MCR, it’s both a logistical and financial issue. A lot of people have been saying Bruno Mars, but my source has told me that it is false, and they have not reached out.”

Negotiations are reportedly ongoing with American alt rock/metal band, My Chemical Romance (Credits: X/@rt_yourfavbands)Negotiations are reportedly ongoing with American alt-rock/metal band My Chemical Romance, though budget concerns are creating hurdles. Well-known EDM artist David Guetta is also in talks, but nothing has been signed yet. As for the widely rumoured Bruno Mars, insiders insist there’s no truth to his inclusion.A dream come true for music enthusiasts in IndiaIf the rumours prove true, Lollapalooza 2026 could mark the first-ever India performances for both Billie Eilish and Linkin Park. For long-time rock and metal fans, Linkin Park’s arrival would be a dream come true, fulfilling years of anticipation after speculation that they might come in 2025. Their music shaped an entire generation, and seeing them live in India would be a historic moment. 
Billie Eilish commands a massive fanbase in India (Credits: X/@billiesource)On the other hand, Gen Z favourite Billie Eilish commands a massive fanbase in the country, with her unique style and chart-topping hits making her one of the most anticipated potential headliners of the festival.Despite the growing excitement, festival organisers have not confirmed any of these names. Lollapalooza India is known for delivering big surprises, so fans will have to wait for the official lineup announcement. Until then, speculation will continue, and if these rumours turn into reality, 2026 might just be Indian music fans’ biggest year yet.
