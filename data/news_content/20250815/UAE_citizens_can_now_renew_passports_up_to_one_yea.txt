The new rule, issued by the ICP, is part of a broader initiative to enhance travel flexibility, streamline official procedures, and strengthen the UAE passport’s global standing.New timeline for passport renewalsThe Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Ports Security (ICP) has revised the policy governing passport renewals for UAE citizens. As per the latest decision by Ali Mohammed Al Shamsi, Chairman of the ICP, Emiratis will now be permitted to renew their passports once the remaining validity is one year or less. This is a shift from the previous rule that allowed renewals only when six months or fewer were left before expiration. The change will be effective Monday, August 18, 2025, and is applicable to all UAE nationals with eligible passports. The aim is to allow for better advance planning, especially for international travel, while reducing disruptions in official transactions and providing extended use of digital documentation. ICP noted that the new timeline will also support seamless transitions for UAE citizens who travel frequently or are involved in long-term visa procedures abroad.Digital-first, accessible renewal processThe ICP has confirmed that the renewal process will remain efficient and widely accessible, continuing to focus on digital services to facilitate ease of access. Citizens can complete the entire renewal process online through the ICP smart services platform, accessible via both the official website and mobile application. The online process allows applicants to:  Fill out the application form   Upload necessary documentation   Make payments digitally   For those who prefer or require in-person assistance, customer happiness centers within the UAE will remain available. Additionally, UAE nationals living abroad can submit their applications through UAE embassies and consulates, and they also have the option to initiate the process online and collect the renewed passport from a diplomatic mission.UAE passport strength and global ranking This update comes at a time when the UAE passport continues to see a significant rise in its global ranking and travel privileges.
