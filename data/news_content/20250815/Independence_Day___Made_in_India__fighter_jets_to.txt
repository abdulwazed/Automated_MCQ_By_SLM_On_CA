PM Modi NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday marked his 12th consecutive Independence Day address from the Red Fort ramparts, breaking former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s record of 11 straight speeches.On the 79th Independence Day, he unveiled a series of initiatives aimed at making India self-reliant, technologically advanced, and economically stronger -- with the clear goal of becoming a developed nation by 2047.Mission Sudarshan ChakraAnnouncing an ambitious plan to strengthen India’s defence capabilities, PM Modi launched "Mission Sudarshan Chakra", inspired by the weapon of Lord Shri Krishna.The mission aims to create an indigenous air defence system similar to Israel’s Iron Dome to protect critical sites, including civilian areas, from terrorist attacks. The Prime Minister set a 2035 target for expanding and modernising this “national security shield” entirely through domestic research, development, and manufacturing.First Made-in-India semiconductor chipsPM Modi confirmed that India’s first domestically produced semiconductor chips will hit the market by the end of 2025. Highlighting decades of lost opportunity, he said the country’s early semiconductor ambitions were stalled “50-60 years ago,” while other nations surged ahead.The launch, he said, will be a turning point for India’s electronics, automotive, and defence sectors.High-power demography missionWarning of demographic changes in border areas, the Prime Minister alleged that infiltrators were threatening livelihoods, targeting women, and misleading tribal communities to seize land.He announced the launch of a “High-Power Demography Mission” to address these concerns, calling demographic shifts in sensitive regions “a direct threat to national security.”PM Viksit Bharat Rozgar YojanaThe Prime Minister officially rolled out the Rs 1 lakh crore "PM Viksit Bharat Rozgar Yojana", aimed at creating 3.5 crore jobs.Under the scheme, youth entering their first private sector job will receive Rs 15,000 from the government, while employers hiring them will get financial incentives.GST reforms as 'Diwali gift'Calling it a “double Diwali” for citizens, PM Modi announced that the government will soon implement next-generation GST reforms to drastically cut taxes on essential goods.He said the changes are “the need of the hour” to ease the financial burden on ordinary people.'Samudra Manthan'The prime minister revealed plans for a National Deep Water Exploration Mission, dubbed "Samudra Manthan", to explore oil and gas reserves in the ocean.The initiative will operate in mission mode and is expected to advance underwater engineering, mineral resource exploration, and ocean research.A large share of India’s budget is still spent on importing petrol, diesel, and gas. PM announced the launch of the National Deepwater Exploration Mission to harness ocean resources, along with major expansions in solar, hydrogen, hydro, and nuclear energy.Defence and space self-relianceThe Prime Minister urged young scientists and engineers to develop a fully indigenous jet engine for India’s fighter aircraft.In the space sector, he announced plans for India to have its own space station, alongside preparations for the Gaganyaan human spaceflight mission. He noted that reforms have enabled over 300 start-ups to enter the space sector, employing thousands of young innovators.Nuclear energy expansionAddressing future energy needs, PM Modi said India is working to increase its nuclear energy capacity tenfold by 2047, with 10 new reactors already in progress. He also highlighted a 30-fold increase in solar capacity over the past 11 years and ongoing investments in hydropower, hydrogen energy, and dam construction.Reform task forceTo accelerate growth, the Prime Minister announced a Reform Task Force that will modernise laws, policies, and governance systems to prepare India for a $10 trillion economy. The task force will work with fixed deadlines to deliver reforms aligned with global best practices.Centre reforms target lower costsThe government’s reforms are designed to cut compliance costs for startups, MSMEs, and entrepreneurs, while removing the fear of outdated legal provisions. The goal is to create a business-friendly environment that fosters innovation and supports economic self-reliance.Reduce compliance costs for startups, MSMEs, and entrepreneursProvide freedom from fear of arbitrary legal actionsEnsure laws are streamlined for ease of doing business'About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
