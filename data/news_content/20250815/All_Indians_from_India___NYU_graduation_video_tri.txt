A video of NYU students sharing their joy of joining jobs straight after their graduation turned into a controversial one as social media users pointed out that almost none of the students interviewed in the video were American. While many users complained that all of them were Indians, all of them were not Indian but mostly all of them were Asians. The video did not reveal their names and all assumptions were based on the appearance and the accent of the graduates. "NYU just posted a video of where their graduates are heading to work after college. Anyone notice anything in this video?" the video meant for rage-bait was captioned. Many users did not take the bait and said they all looked like America-born immigrants and there was nothing wrong about it. Some, in fact, pointed out the lack of diversity in their jobs, showing they are not interested in other fields. "Nice dog whistle. The reason the US is an economic powerhouse is because of it’s cognitively elite immigrants. But yeah, keep being mad at them," one wrote. "All of them must be sent back. We must reclaim our universities for Americans," another wrote.PollDo you think diversity among graduates entering the workforce is a strength?Yes, it brings fresh perspectivesNo, it affects local opportunities"Can someone please explain how these foreigners get into this school, the how can they afford it? After they got here to this country and got into this school and all that good stuff , how do they get jobs in the biggest companies on earth? I was born in Brooklyn , I can’t even get a job at Burger King. Asking for a friend thanks," one wrote. "Why is America educating its enemies? I’ve heard that they also get scholarships and aid. What are we doing here?" one comment read. "All the Indians are from India with accents not American born and they’re taking jobs away from American born graduates," a user wrote. "Too much brown. And a lot of purple," one wrote, purple being the color of their graduation robe. With the big tech companies announcing major layoffs this year, all eyes are on the hirings and how much of it actually goes to American graduates.
