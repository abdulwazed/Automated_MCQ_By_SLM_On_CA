She proposed measures to strengthen the system and expand benefits. Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren (AP images) President Donald Trump on Thursday said that Senator Elizabeth Warren “has got to take a drug test” in response to her claims that he is trying to cut Social Security.Trump made the remarks during a White House event marking the 90th anniversary of the Social Security Act, where he pledged to strengthen the program “for generations to come.”"It's so vicious what they do. Elizabeth Warren said she was an Indian. We call her Pocahontas. She's a liar. She lied her whole career," Trump said. "Based on the fact that she was an Indian, she was able to get into certain colleges, get certain jobs, get into certain universities to work there. And she's a liar and a mean person." Trump also criticized Warren for supporting Democratic Socialist New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. "She's a nutjob. I watched her the other night. She's all hopped up endorsing a communist in New York City, and she was all excited and jumping up and down. She's got to take a drug test. She really, though, she's got to take a drug test. There's no way somebody can act that way and be normal.”Earlier this year, Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, wrote an op-ed for Fox News claiming that Social Security is under unprecedented attack under the Trump administration. She criticized billionaire Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Elon Musk, alleging attempts to weaken the program by firing workers, closing offices and cutting services, as reported by Fox News.Warren said that Social Security services should not be cut or Americans’ benefits threatened. She added that people are struggling with high prices while their retirement savings shrink. She called for a temporary increase in benefits to provide relief and suggested lifting the cap on contributions from millionaires and billionaires to secure the system long-term and fund permanent benefit expansion.Trump defended his administration’s approach, saying, “We've already kicked nearly 275,000 illegal aliens off of the Social Security system."The US President said that many of these people have already left the country, yet they were still receiving Social Security checks. He added that removing them strengthens the system and contrasted with former President Joe Biden, who he claimed did not remove anyone and allowed everyone to stay on.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
