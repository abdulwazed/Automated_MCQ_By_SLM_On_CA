"The problem can be solved only by regulating the population of street dogs. But, it cannot be resolved by putting stray dogs in shelters,” he said.According to Shyam Thapa, a Kathmandu-based telecom professional, Nepalese see dogs as sacred and worship the mute canines during the ritual of the Himalayan nation's five-day Kukur Tihar."This unique ritual during Diwali celebrates the beautiful bond between humans and dogs. We urge all Indians to unite against the Supreme Court order and save the stray dogs. Population control & community feeding will help put an end to the so-called problem," he said.In fact, the significance of Kukur Tihar "is deeply rooted in Nepalese mythology", he said. On its second day, pet and stray dogs are honoured with garlands of flowers, given a tika and offered food."Nepalese worship dogs, both strays & pets, as they symbolise loyalty and ultimate protection. But it's heartbreaking to see that a vocal group in India is celebrating the top court's death sentence to strays in Delhi-NCR," said Mohanlal Bhandari, a Kathmandu-based businessman.It may be mentioned here that dogs are also revered in Indian mythology for their loyalty and protective nature. In Mahabharat, for example, Yudhishtir refuses to go to heaven without his faithful dog by his side."Cutting across political and religious lines, all Indians must unite and save the strays. Putting them in pounds will lead to their deaths. And those pounds will eventually become breeding grounds for zoonotic diseases," said Neha Acharya, a Nepali student.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousDivine baby names inspired by Lord KrishnaastrologyAshnoor Kaur’s top 10 ultra-glam lookstvRubina Dilaik's powerful reality show lookstvIn pic: Radiant pictures of Pooja HegdeEntertainment5 human body parts we may no longer need in the futureLifestyleBollywood-approved ethnic sets that are perfect for Independence Day 2025Lifestyle10 Stunning ethnic looks of Megha Shettytv10 celeb-inspired Indian baby girl namesLifestyleOne's own enemy: 8 animals that get triggered by their own reflectionLifestyleIndependence Day 2025: 10 inspiring lines on Freedom that warm the heartLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Independence Day: PM Modi's iconic turban looks at Red Fort since 2014 - In picsBeyond the Crown: Lara Dutta’s surprising life stories9 health benefits of potatoes (backed by science)Janmashtami 2025: 5 diabetes-friendly sweet recipes for Janmashtami bhog50 Years of Thalaivar: Rajinikanth’s iconic movies that fans cherish forever7 workout supplements every fitness enthusiast should know5 simple chia seed recipes that help in weight loss5 foods that can lower the chances of getting a strokeWhy Aarti has 5 flames: The deep meaning behind itIndia at 79: PM Modi leads Independence Day celebrations - In pics123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingLeBron JamesTom BradyDwyane WadeBrock Lesnar Net WorthPlayStation Plus GamesShedeur SanderStefon DiggsJoy TaylorNYU StudentsPatrick MahmoesTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteIndependence Day: 'Made in India' fighter jets to Rs 1 lakh crore youth employment push — 10 major announcements by PM ModiKishtwar cloudburst: PM Modi assures all help to J&K CM Omar Abdullah; death toll rises to 60'Infiltrators snatching bread & butter': PM Modi announces demographic mission on Independence Day - What is it?Sudarshan Chakra Mission: India to develop powerful weapon system; all you need to know about ‘Rashtriya Suraksha Kavach’79th Independence Day: PM Modi delivers longest speech at 103 minutes; breaks previous 98-minute recordIndia at 79: Google Doodle celebrates India's Independence Day - from cricket to cinemaIndependence Day: US extends warm wishes; calls 'historical ties' with India 'consequential and far-reaching'Independence Day 2025: Tiranga, Operation Sindoor banner soar above Red Fort - video‘First job, Rs 15,000 from government’: PM Modi announces Pradhan Mantri Viksit Bharat Rozgar Yojana; unveils scheme in Independence Day speechIndependence Day: PM Modi warns ‘India will not tolerate nuclear threats’; strong message to Pakistan from Red FortIndependence Day 2025 Live Updates: PM Modi calls for indigenous jet engines; pitches for ‘Made in India’ fighter jetsPM Modi announces ₹99,446 crore PM-VBRY scheme, how it will boost the job sectorLeBron James’ wife Savannah James revealed that their love story might have ended if he hadn’t made a crucial career moveRussell Wilson's wife Ciara becomes first descendants of enslaved Africans to receive Benin citizenship under historic new lawJamie Dimon on US-China technology arms race: It’s a little embarrassing that we as a nation allowed 100 per cent of our Penicillin to come from China, and all ...LinkedIn announces list of 50 best US colleges for long-term career success: Princeton leads, with Duke, UPenn, MIT and Cornell in top five'All Indians from India': NYU graduation video triggers major row; 'too much brown'Vanessa Bryant finally breaks silence on wild pregnancy rumors with a wild response featuring a Rihanna memeDrug trafficking, forcing migrant minors to work at hotels, visa fraud: Five Indian-Americans charged in NebraskaH-1B cap cases denied because of digital signatures?
