The district has introduced safe zones, virtual schooling, legal aid, and family support programs to protect immigrant students and address trauma-induced absenteeism and anxiety.  A routine school registration turned into a flashpoint over immigration enforcement in Los Angeles recently, when a 15-year-old boy with significant disabilities was allegedly detained at gunpoint outside Arleta High School. According to Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) officials, the incident unfolded as federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security approached the family of a female student who was registering at the school.“Today, unidentified immigration agents handcuffed, detained, and drew their guns on a BD6 student outside Arleta High School in an alleged case of mistaken identity,” LAUSD Board Member Kelly Gonez said in a statement. “Such actions — violently detaining a child just outside a public school — are absolutely reprehensible and should have no place in our country.”The boy was ultimately released at the scene. According to media reports, he is a student at San Fernando High School and had gone to Arleta High only to accompany a family member for registration, according to media reports. The campus falls within LAUSD’s Board District 6, which covers the eastern San Fernando Valley and is represented by Board Member Kelly Gonez. For LAUSD, the detention was more than an isolated enforcement action; it was a wake-up call to reinforce its role as a protector of vulnerable students. So, LSAUD is strengthening its safety measures to keep school kids safe. Here is how.Safe zones and virtual schoolsIn response to incidents such as this, LAUSD has strengthened safety protocols to create “safe zones” at and around school campuses. The district has established rapid-response protocols to address any future encounters with immigration personnel. These measures are designed to protect students from undue stress or disruption while on or near school grounds.LAUSD also continues to offer virtual schooling options for students affected by immigration enforcement. By enabling online learning, the district ensures continuity in education for students whose families may feel apprehensive about attending in-person classes. Enrollment in these virtual programs has reportedly increased in recent months, reflecting both the demand for alternative learning options and the anxiety that students and families are experiencing.Support for familiesBeyond physical safety, LAUSD has introduced a suite of initiatives to support the emotional and legal needs of immigrant families. These include:A 24/7 family hotline that provides assistance with immigration and mental health concerns.Legal referrals as part of the district’s 2025 “We Are One” campaign, which aims to actively involve immigrant families in school affairs.The “We Have Rights” empowerment campaign, offering guidance on common immigration enforcement encounters through animated resources in seven languages.Weekly workshops beginning August 22 to educate students and families on their legal rights and to provide practical support in navigating enforcement situations.These initiatives are part of LAUSD’s broader effort to ensure that immigrant families feel included, supported, and informed within the school community.The new lesson plan in America’s schools: FearRecent immigration enforcement policies under the Trump administration — marked by ambiguity over who will be arrested and how long they may be detained — are fueling chronic anxiety among students. This anxiety, according to a July report by psychiatric researchers at the University of California, Riverside, and New York University, has been linked to absenteeism, classroom disengagement, and heightened emotional distress. The researchers wrote that such fears have driven some students “to avoid school or withdraw from public life.”While the report underscores schools’ importance in identifying and supporting students’ mental health needs early, it also warns that they can become sites where immigrant youth “experience trauma-related avoidance, disengagement, or behavioral challenges.”TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.
