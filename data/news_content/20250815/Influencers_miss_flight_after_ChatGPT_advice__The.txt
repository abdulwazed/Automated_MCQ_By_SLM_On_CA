They were traveling to Puerto Rico. ChatGPT gave them wrong travel advice. It said no visa was needed. But an ESTA was necessary. They missed this detail. The couple got stuck. Another man was hospitalized. He followed AI suggestions. Experts advise caution with AI.   Influencer couple Mery Caldass and Alejandro Cid were all set for what should’ve been a dreamy trip to Puerto Rico. But instead of basking in beach vibes, they ended up stuck in an airport, sobbing and blaming none other than ChatGPT for their nightmare.In a now-viral TikTok with over 13,000 views, as reported by New York Post, Mery with tears streaming, frustration loud and clearly explains that, “I always do tons of research, but I asked ChatGPT and it said no visa was needed.” Which, sure, sounds convenient. But unfortunately, that “advice” missed a tiny, yet crucial detail: while they didn’t need a visa for Puerto Rico, they did need something called an ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorization). It’s kind of like a quick online clearance that ChatGPT apparently forgot to mention.Unsurprisingly, the clip lit up the internet. A lot of people had words. Some were with the sarcasm, like commenting, “Natural selection, I guess,” mocking their decision to rely on ChatGPT for something important. Another quipped, “Who trusts ChatGPT for that kind of info?”On the flip side, a few folks defended the AI: maybe the couple just didn’t phrase their question properly, sure, they asked if they needed a visa, but they never asked whether an ESTA was necessary. What is ESTA?The ESTA, short for Electronic System for Travel Authorization, is basically an online permission slip. If you’re from one of the eligible countries, you don’t need a full visa, but you do need to fill out this quick online form before you travel. It’s not a visa interview or a mountain of paperwork, just an application you do online, pay a small fee for, and usually get approved within minutes (though they say apply at least 72 hours before your trip, just in case). Once approved, it’s valid for two years, and you can use it for multiple trips. Think of it as a “fast pass” but skip it, and you might end up like those influencers stuck at the airport instead of sipping piña coladas.Another ChatGPT mishapThis isn’t the only headline-grabbing ChatGPT slip-up lately. Other stories have spotlighted more concerning misadventures: one older guy ended up hospitalized with hallucinations after following AI-generated suggestions. Clearly, when it comes to AI, a healthy dose of skepticism and double-checking is a must.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousRubina Dilaik's powerful reality show lookstvIn pic: Radiant pictures of Pooja HegdeEntertainment5 human body parts we may no longer need in the futureLifestyleBollywood-approved ethnic sets that are perfect for Independence Day 2025Lifestyle10 Stunning ethnic looks of Megha Shettytv10 celeb-inspired Indian baby girl namesLifestyleOne's own enemy: 8 animals that get triggered by their own reflectionLifestyleIndependence Day 2025: 10 inspiring lines on Freedom that warm the heartLifestyleJanmashtami 2025: Ethnic Glam Lessons from Malavika MohananEntertainmentHow to build a balcony water garden with easy care stepsLifestyle Next123 Photostories  5 simple chia seed recipes that help in weight loss5 foods that can lower the chances of getting a strokeWhy Aarti has 5 flames: The deep meaning behind itIndia at 79: PM Modi leads Independence Day celebrations - In pics5 unique and must-have desserts made with eggsIndependence Day 2025: Bollywood actors who have portrayed freedom fightersDid you know Sameera Reddy was the first Indian actress to have her own video game?From forest to ice: 6 animals that vanish into their habitatFreedom Trails: Cities where India’s independence was forgedIndependence Day special: This Indian floral fabric threatened Europe’s textile industry123Tired of too many ads?go ad free nowlifestyle videos13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement16:34Life After 60: Why India's seniors are choosing community living04:34Control Your Senses, Gain Knowledge, Attain Peace: Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4.3906:37Cultural Clashes in Love: How To Make Your Relationship Work03:19Prayagraj MahaKumbh 2025 Readies For Millions: Massive Preparations Underway In Uttar Pradesh04:48Sadhguru Reveals The Truth About Black Magic And Your Photograph07:18BK Shivani On Forgiveness: Why It’s Essential For Inner Peace08:08How Bhairavi Sadhana Accelerates Your Path to Liberation: Sadhguru Speaks06:47Breakup Recovery: How To Not Wallow In Misery And Love Yourself03:20The Purifying Power of Yajna: Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4, Verse 3011:41How Dattatreya Accepted Parashuram as His Disciple – Sadhguru Reveals03:54Can Water Remember?
