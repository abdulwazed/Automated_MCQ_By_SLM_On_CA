Tropical Storm Erin is intensifying in the Atlantic and is projected to become the first hurricane of the 2025 season by Friday, August 15. Meteorologists warn that Erin could escalate into a Category 3 major hurricane by the weekend, posing potential risks to the US East Coast and Bermuda.

The storm is expected to pass north-northeast of Puerto Rico, Antigua and Barbuda, and the Virgin Islands. Tropical storm watches are in effect for Anguilla, Barbuda, St. Martin, St. Maarten, and surrounding islands. While Erin is projected to stay over open waters for now, its potential intensification into a major hurricane raises concerns for the US East Coast and Bermuda later next week.Emergency preparedness and state of emergency for stormIn anticipation of Erin's possible impact, local governments in the Virgin Islands are ramping up emergency response efforts. Authorities are urging residents to secure their property and stock essential supplies.
