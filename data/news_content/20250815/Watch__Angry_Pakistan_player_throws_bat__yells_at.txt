The incident occurred after the opening partnership had built a strong foundation of 118 runs in the first 11 overs, with both batters having scored half-centuries.The run-out occurred on the first ball of the 12th over when Khan faced right-arm pacer Mrittunjoy Chowdhury. Khan attempted to flick a ball that was angling across him into the leg side, which hit his pads and rolled across the pitch. Nafay immediately started running for a single while Khan hesitated to check if the ball was rolling back towards his stumps.Despite Khan's signal to stop, Nafay continued his run down the pitch. Khan took a step forward before deciding against the single, but by then, the wicketkeeper had nearly collected the ball. Although Nafay tried to make it back to his crease, the ball was thrown accurately to Chowdhury at the non-striker's end, who removed the bails with Nafay well short of his ground.The dismissal triggered an immediate and intense reaction from Nafay, who threw his bat onto the ground in frustration. He then turned towards Khan and displayed his anger through aggressive gestures, throwing his arms out and pointing at his partner.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.
