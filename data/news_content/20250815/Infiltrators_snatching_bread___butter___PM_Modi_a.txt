(Pic credit: PTI) NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said that a premeditated conspiracy is being orchestrated to change the demography of India through illegal infiltration. In a strongly worded speech, the Prime Minister said that these "ghuspaithiyas" (infiltrators) are posing major challenges, but no nation can tolerate intruders. To tackle this "new crisis", he announced a high-powered demographic mission. Addressing the nation on the 79th Independence Day, PM Modi said the country's forefathers made the supreme sacrifice to win freedom for Indians, and it is the duty of its citizens not to accept such activities.'Ghuspaithiyas snatching bread & butter, targeting daughters & sisters"I wish to warn the country about a concern that is emerging as a crisis. As part of a premeditated conspiracy, the country's demography is being changed. Seeds of a new crisis are being sown," PM Modi said. "These ghuspaithiyas (infiltrators) are snatching the bread and butter of our youth. These ghuspaithiyas are targeting our country's daughters and sisters. This will not be tolerated. These ghuspaithiyas are fooling innocent tribals and capturing their forest land. This country will not tolerate this," he asserted. What is demographic mission? PM Modi highlighted that the government is starting a high-powered demographic mission to tackle this crisis."From the ramparts of the Red Fort, I want to say that we have decided to start a high-powered demographic mission. This mission will tackle this serious crisis and will take care of the crisis looming large over our country in a set time frame. We are moving forward towards it," he announced.How can we hand over Bharat to them?PM Modi underscored the threats posed by infiltrators, saying that when demographic changes occur, they create a national security crisis. "It also creates a crisis for our unity, integrity and progress. It sows the seeds of social tension. No nation in the world can hand over itself to ghuspaithiyas, then how can we hand over Bharat to them?" PM Modi stressed."Our forefathers got freedom by making the supreme sacrifice. They gave us an independent India and it is our duty that we do not accept such activities. This will be our true tribute to them," he added.
