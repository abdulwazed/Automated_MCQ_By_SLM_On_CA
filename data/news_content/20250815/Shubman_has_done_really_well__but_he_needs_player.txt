Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma (AFP Photo) Former India cricket stalwarts Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, who retired from Test cricket in May, face uncertainty about their international future in limited-overs formats as they approach their late 30s. While India's Test transition progresses smoothly with new captain Shubman Gill and others performing well, questions remain about the veteran duo's place in the team leading up to the 2027 World Cup, where they would be 40 and 39 years old, respectively.The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and team management under Gautam Gambhir will need to make crucial decisions about their roles, particularly with reports suggesting Rohit may soon be asked to step down as ODI captain to facilitate Gill's leadership transition.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Former India cricketer Suresh Raina has voiced strong support for retaining both players, highlighting their crucial experience in white-ball cricket."India don't have dependable players at No. 1 and No. 3 (in ODIs) at the moment, especially when chasing. Rohit and Virat's experience is very important. It's crucial for the seniors to stay involved with the juniors. Shubman (Gill) has done really well, but he needs players like Virat and Rohit," said Raina, who was part of India's 2011 World Cup-winning team, in an interview with Telecom Asia Sport.Both Rohit and Kohli demonstrated their continued value to Indian cricket during the recent Champions Trophy in the UAE, just five months after a disappointing Border-Gavaskar Trophy tour to Australia.Rohit earned the Player of the Match award in the final victory against New Zealand, while Kohli contributed significantly with an 84-run knock in the semi-final against Australia and a century against Pakistan."They have won the Champions Trophy, they have won the World Cups. Virat won the last IPL also. For the astute leadership they have shown during their respective careers, they need to be part of the dressing room," Raina emphasised.Statistics from the current decade (since 2020) underscore their consistent performances in ODI cricket. Kohli has scored 2,572 runs in 57 innings at an average of 50.43, including eight centuries and 19 fifties. Rohit has accumulated 2,224 runs in 51 innings at an average of 47.31, with four centuries and 15 fifties.The immediate future will see both players absent from India's T20 Asia Cup campaign and home Test matches in September. Their next anticipated international appearance will be during India's tour of Australia in October, featuring three ODIs beginning October 19 in Perth, followed by matches in Adelaide and Sydney.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
