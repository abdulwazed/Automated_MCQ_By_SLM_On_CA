Outperforming 934 participants, she contributed to a record 294 pythons removed during the 10-day event. The challenge highlights the critical role of citizen engagement in controlling this invasive species and protecting Florida's native wildlife.  A Florida woman has won the 2025 Florida Python Challenge after removing 60 invasive Burmese pythons from the Everglades, winning the grand prize of $10,000. Taylor Stanberry outperformed 934 participants from 30 U.S. states and Canada in a 10-day competition aimed at controlling the spread of this dangerous species. The event, held from July 11 to 20, saw a record 294 pythons removed from the wild, highlighting both the scale of the infestation and the critical role of citizen engagement in conservation. Officials described Stanberry’s achievement as a major win for Florida’s native wildlife.Taylor Stanberry’s record-breaking python achievementTaylor Stanberry, a Naples resident and self-described “venomous keeper” and “relocator,” captured 60 pythons during the challenge, more than any other participant. Known as the “new queen of the Everglades,” she demonstrated exceptional skill and patience, contributing significantly to efforts to curb the Burmese python population in Florida. Burmese pythons are highly adaptable and can lay 50–100 eggs at a time, making them a persistent threat to the Everglades’ delicate ecosystem. Her accomplishment underscores how individual action can make a measurable difference in wildlife conservation and sets a high benchmark for future competitors.The Florida Python Challenge: purpose and participationThe Florida Python Challenge is an annual event organized by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) to reduce the number of invasive pythons and raise public awareness about their impact on native ecosystems. This year, 934 participants competed across eight official locations, including Everglades National Park, to capture the most pythons within the 10-day window. Participants must complete online training and adhere to humane python-killing guidelines. Firearms, dogs, or other animals are not permitted, emphasizing safe and responsible removal.Conservation impact and community engagementThe record removal of 294 pythons in 2025 represents a milestone in ongoing conservation efforts. FWC Chairman Rodney Barreto noted, “With over 1,400 pythons removed during all Florida Python Challenge events to date and over 16,000 pythons removed by FWC and South Florida Water Management District contractors since 2017, collective efforts are the key to continuing to address the threats Burmese pythons pose to Florida’s native wildlife and ecosystems.” Pedro Ramos, superintendent of Everglades National Park, added that the challenge highlighted the importance of citizen participation in tackling invasive species.Understanding the threat of Burmese pythonsBurmese pythons are native to Southeast Asia but have become one of Florida’s most notorious invasive species due to the exotic pet trade. Their rapid reproduction and adaptability threaten the natural food chain in the Everglades, impacting native species and the overall ecosystem. Since 2000, over 23,000 pythons have been removed from the wild, but the challenge continues to play a crucial role in controlling their population. The annual event educates the public about the ecological risks and encourages responsible participation in wildlife management.Other competition highlightsAside from the grand prize winner, participants competed in various categories, including the “longest python” captured. Taylor Stanberry’s success has brought additional attention to the Python Challenge, inspiring new participants and emphasizing the importance of collaboration with partners like the South Florida Water Management District and the National Park Service. The inclusion of Everglades National Park as an official competition site this year provided both a new challenge and an opportunity to raise public awareness about the ongoing threat posed by invasive Burmese pythons.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
