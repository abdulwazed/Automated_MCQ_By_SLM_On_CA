Malik faces allegations of violating the Hindu Marriage Act by allegedly having four marriages. Additionally, Payal Malik is accused of hurting religious sentiments by dressing as the Hindu goddess Kali in a video.  YouTuber and Bigg Boss OTT 3 contestant Armaan Malik, along with his wives Payal Malik and Kritika Malik, have been summoned by a Patiala district court in connection with two separate legal cases. According to reports on news portals, the court has directed all three to appear on 2 September.At a time when the YouTuber is in the midst of controversy over his personal life and alleged four marriages, just last year, during his stint on Bigg Boss OTT 3, Malik opened up to ETimes TV and described entering the reality show with both wives as a “historic” moment. On His Bigg Boss Stint“This is going to go down in Bigg Boss history that we entered the show together and I was able to handle things well with them. Also, Payal and Kritika are very sensible, strong, and capable of standing up for themselves,” he said.On Criticism Over 2 WivesResponding to criticism over his marital choices, Malik added, “I am not here to change anyone’s thinking or mindset. I just want to take care of my home and my wives. Everyone’s life is different. Every man wants to have two wives in their life, but it doesn’t happen for most because they can’t handle the first one.”About The Legal DramaThe summons follows a petition filed by Davinder Rajput, who has alleged that Malik has entered into four marriages, in violation of the Hindu Marriage Act, which allows only one marriage at a time for individuals practising Hinduism.In addition to the bigamy allegations, the petition accuses Armaan and Payal Malik of hurting religious sentiments. It claims that Payal appeared dressed as the Hindu goddess Kali in an Instagram video, sparking outrage. The petitioner argues that this act was offensive to religious beliefs and constitutes a punishable offence under Indian law.Investigations into the allegations are ongoing."Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
