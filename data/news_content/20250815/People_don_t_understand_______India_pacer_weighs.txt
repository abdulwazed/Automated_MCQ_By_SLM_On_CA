Jasprit Bumrah NEW DELHI: India pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar has thrown his weight behind Jasprit Bumrah amid the ongoing debate over the star fast bowler’s workload management. Ahead of the 2025 Anderson–Tendulkar Trophy against England, the selectors decided that Bumrah would play only three of the five Tests — a move that sparked widespread discussion.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Speaking on the podcast Talk with Manvendra, Bhuvneshwar offered a strong defence of the decision. "Look, considering how many years Jasprit Bumrah has been playing and competing in all formats, it is tough for anyone to sustain that. And with the kind of bowling action Bumrah has, injuries can happen to him or to anyone," he said.How Jasprit Bumrah is preparing for Lord's Test - batting, bowling and lot of jokes!"I had no problem with him playing three out of five matches. If the selectors know what he can offer and are okay with it, it’s because they know he can still make a big impact in those three games. If a player might not play all five matches but will contribute significantly in three, that should be okay," he added.PollDo you agree with the selectors' decision to allow Bumrah to play only three out of five Tests?Yes, it's a smart move for his longevityNo, he should play all matchesBhuvneshwar highlighted the physical and mental demands Bumrah faces. "People don’t always understand how tough it is to keep playing for so many years across formats. Bumrah is always bowling in tough situations, which brings both mental and physical pressure. If you want a player to have a long career, you have to manage them somehow."Bumrah repaid the faith in style, bagging 14 wickets in his three appearances against England, including two five-wicket hauls.Reflecting on Bumrah’s journey, Bhuvneshwar said: "When he first came in, everyone could see there was something special. Skill-wise, nothing has changed — he was as good back then as he is now. But with years of performance comes confidence. Once you are established, you don’t panic if things go wrong. That maturity comes with age."With 207 international matches and 457 wickets to his name, Bumrah remains a cornerstone of India’s attack.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
