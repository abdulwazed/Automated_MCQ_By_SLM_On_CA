Limiting trans fats found in processed foods and incorporating monounsaturated fats from avocados, olive oil, and nuts can help. Regular exercise, aiming for at least 150 minutes of moderate activity weekly, is also crucial. Maintaining a healthy weight through diet and exercise further supports healthy cholesterol levels.  High cholesterol is a condition in which you have too much of a fatty substance called cholesterol in your blood. Elevated levels of LDL 'bad' cholesterol increase the risk of buildup of plaque in arteries, which can lead to heart disease and stroke. Keeping the cholesterol levels in check is crucial. Though medications can help, taking certain steps at home can help manage cholesterol levels. Take a look. Beat belly fat with millets: Easy breakfast ideas for quick weight lossKeep trans fat at bayTrans fats, also known as trans unsaturated fatty acids, are unsaturated fats that naturally occur in foods or are modified by a process called hydrogenation. It is an unhealthy fat found in processed foods, fried items, and baked goods. Consuming this trans fat will elevate the bad cholesterol and lower your good cholesterol (HDL). How to keep them at bay? Avoid foods like margarine, pastries, baked goods, some microwaveable popcorn, fried fast food, pizzas, and nondairy coffee creamer.Say ‘Yes’ to monounsaturated fatsNot all fats are the same. One of the best ways to lower cholesterol is to incorporate more monounsaturated fats in your diet. Think of eating avocados, olive oil, nuts such as almonds, cashews, and pecans, and olives. These are healthy fats that can lower bad cholesterol and also reduce your risk of heart disease. A 2022 study has found that eating one avocado a day for six months can reduce unhealthy cholesterol levels. They found that consuming avocados daily resulted in total cholesterol decreasing 2.9 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) and LDL cholesterol decreasing 2.5 mg/dL.Exercise regularlyStaying active is essential in keeping cholesterol levels in check. Regular exercise is an effective way to improve cholesterol levels. Studies have consistently shown that physical activity helps raise HDL while lowering LDL and triglycerides. Aim to get at least 150 minutes of moderate to intense aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous activity in a week. This could be walking, swimming, jogging, or cycling. You can also engage in intense physical activity such as HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training). Adjust your exercise intensity based on your health and fitness levels. Maintain a healthy weightIt is important to maintain a healthy weight. This is not about fitting into a conventional beauty standard, but being healthy. Obesity can negatively affect cholesterol levels. Studies have consistently shown that overweight and obesity raise levels of LDL ‘bad’ cholesterol. Even losing 5 to 10 percent of body weight can significantly lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Focus on eating a well-balanced and nutritious diet, along with exercise, to maintain a healthy weight.
