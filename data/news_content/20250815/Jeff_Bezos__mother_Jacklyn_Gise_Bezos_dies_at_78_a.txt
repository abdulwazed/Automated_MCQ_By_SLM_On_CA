She became a mother at 17 and raised Jeff, later building a close-knit family with her husband, Miguel "Mike" Bezos.  Jacklyn “Jackie” Gise Bezos, matriarch of the Bezos family and Jeff Bezos's loving mum, passed away on August 14, 2025, at the age of 78. She died peacefully at her home in Miami, surrounded by family, after a long, courageous fight with Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) that she’d been battling since 2020.Jackie’s journey into motherhood began early—she became a mum at just 17, giving birth to Jeff in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Despite all odds, she raised him on her own after her first marriage ended, and later married Miguel “Mike” Bezos in 1968, who became not just her partner but also Jeff’s adoptive dad. Together they built a close-knit family that included Jeff’s siblings Christina and Mark.Jeff Bezos No Longer World’s Second-Richest!Heartfelt tributeJeff has posted a heartfelt tribute on social media for his mother. "Her adulthood started a little bit early when she became my mom at the tender age of 17. That couldn’t have been easy, but she made it all work. She pounced on the job of loving me with ferocity, brought my amazing dad onto the team a few years later, and then added my sister and brother to her list of people to love, guard, and nourish. For the rest of her life, that list of people to love never stopped growing. She always gave so much more than she ever asked for," he writes. "After a long fight with Lewy Body Dementia, she passed away today, surrounded by so many of us who loved her — her kids, grandkids, and my dad. I know she felt our love in those final moments. We were all so lucky to be in her life. I hold her safe in my heart forever," he adds.Lewy Body Dementia: What is it?Lewy Body Dementia is a brain disorder that slowly chips away at a person’s memory, thinking skills, movement, and even mood. It’s actually the second most common type of progressive dementia after Alzheimer’s, but it often flies under the radar because its symptoms can look like a mix of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.The “Lewy bodies” in the name are tiny, abnormal protein clumps (called alpha-synuclein) that build up in brain cells. Imagine little unwanted “globs” in your brain’s control center—messing with how your neurons talk to each other. Over time, these globs cause brain cells to stop working properly and eventually die off.LBD can feel like a moving target. Symptoms often change from day to day, or even within the same day. Some of the most common signs are:Memory & thinking problems – kind of like Alzheimer’s, but sometimes less obvious in the very beginning.Hallucinations – people may see things that aren’t there, and these can be vivid and detailed.Movement issues – slow walking, stiffness, tremors—very Parkinson’s-like.Sleep changes – one common thing is “acting out” dreams (called REM sleep behavior disorder), where people physically move or talk in their sleep.Alertness swings – one hour someone might be sharp and chatty, and the next they seem confused or out of it.Because it blends symptoms from different brain disorders, LBD is often misdiagnosed—and getting the right diagnosis is key for proper care.Right now, there’s no cure for Lewy Body Dementia. Doctors can help manage symptoms with a mix of medications, lifestyle adjustments, and support therapies (like physical or occupational therapy). But here’s the kicker—some common Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s drugs can actually make certain LBD symptoms worse, so treatment has to be extra carefully managed. It usually shows up in people over 50 (most often in their 70s or 80s), and both men and women can get it. It’s not rare—experts estimate it affects about 1.4 million people in the US alone, and similar rates in Canada and the UK.Jackie was diagnosed in 2020 and faced the disease head-on with dignity and courage—having her devoted husband Mike by her side at every step.She was a real-life superstar—raising kids, going back to school in her mid-40s to earn a psychology degree, all while working and juggling life’s curveballs. Her fierce spirit didn’t stop there—Jackie helped launch Amazon in 1995 with a game-changing early investment (around $245–250 k), a move that would go on to shape history.On top of that, her heart for others ran deep. In 2000, she co-founded the Bezos Family Foundation, championing initiatives like Vroom (brain-science-based parenting tools) and the Bezos Scholars Program (supporting youth both in North America and Africa). Her dedication to education, empathy, and community was palpable every step of the way.Her philanthropic impact reached even further—Jackie and Mike backed groundbreaking immunotherapy cancer research through partnerships with Seattle’s Fred Hutch Cancer Center, including a massive $710 million gift in 2022 that was one of the largest donations the center had ever seen.Jacklyn “Jackie” Gise Bezos lived a life that was nothing short of extraordinary. She was a trailblazer, a nurturer, a lifelong learner, and a visionary who invested not just in her son’s dreams but also in the futures of countless others. Her fierce love for family, coupled with her tireless work in education and healthcare, leaves an imprint that will last for generations.Get the latest lifestyle updates on Times of India, along with Happy Independence Day wishes, messages, and quotes !About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.
