From cultural events to historic quotes by Bhagat Singh, Ambedkar, Nehru, Azad, and Gandhi, the day echoed pride and purpose. Citizens shared heartfelt wishes, pledging peace, resilience, and a united vision for India’s future.  India today stands draped in the tricolour, marking 79 years since it cast off the yoke of British colonial rule on August 15, 1947. The anniversary of freedom is not merely a date on the calendar — it is a reminder of the long, arduous struggle waged by freedom fighters and ordinary citizens who dreamed of a sovereign nation. Across the country, streets are alive with cultural programmes, rallies, flag processions, marathons, and seminars, all paying homage to those who sacrificed their lives for India’s liberty.Echoes of the freedom struggle resonate across IndiaThis year’s celebrations carry a dual spirit — a commemoration of the past and a vision for the future. Voices from history echo through the nation’s consciousness, reminding people why freedom must be cherished and protected. As Sardar Bhagat Singh once proclaimed, "May the sun in his course visit no land more free, more happy, more lovely, than this our country!"Words from the icons who shaped India’s destinyThe fight for independence was never solely about political sovereignty; it was about liberating the human spirit. BR Ambedkar’s words resonate deeply in this regard: "Freedom of mind is real freedom. A person whose mind is not free, though he may not be in chains, is a slave, not a free man. One whose mind is not free, though he may not be in prison, is a prisoner and not a free man. One whose mind is not free, though alive, is no better than dead. Freedom of mind is the proof of one's existence."For Chandra Shekhar Azad, the essence of freedom lay in self-discipline and personal excellence: "Don't see others doing better than you beat your own records every day, because success is a fight between you and yourself."From Bhagat Singh to Gandhi: Messages that still inspireThe country’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, captured the essence of responsible citizenship in a single line: "Citizenship consists in the service of the country."And Mahatma Gandhi, the moral compass of India’s independence movement, summed up the invaluable nature of liberty: "Freedom is never dear at any price. It is the breath of life. What would a man not pay for living?"Citizens share heartfelt Independence Day wishesAs citizens wave the national flag today, many share heartfelt wishes that echo the spirit of unity and progress: "Happy Independence Day to you and your family. May this day be a reminder of the wonderful country we live in and how we worked hard for its freedom." Others look ahead with optimism: "Happy Independence Day 2025. Here's to building a stronger, powerful and more resilient India."There is also a call for togetherness: "On this Independence Day, let's unite as one nation and celebrate the diversity that makes us strong." The emotional fervour continues with words of hope: "May the spirit of freedom and patriotism ignite in our hearts. Happy Independence Day!" and "Let's celebrate our nation's sovereignty and freedom. Wishing you a Happy Independence Day!"Looking ahead: A resilient and united IndiaFinally, the collective aspiration for peace and prosperity is clear in the message: "May our country always be blessed with peace, prosperity and harmony. Happy Independence Day!"Seventy-nine years on, India celebrates not just its hard-won sovereignty but the enduring responsibility to guard and nurture it. Today’s Independence Day is both a tribute to history and a promise to the future, that the sacrifices of the past will continue to inspire a united, resilient, and forward-looking nation.Ready to navigate global policies?
