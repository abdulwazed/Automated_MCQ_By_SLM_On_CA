This incident, during Jr NTR's entry scene, prompted mixed reactions online, with some criticizing the dangerous behavior. Similar incidents occurred previously, such as during a 'Tiger 3' screening, raising alarms about safety enforcement in cinemas.  The release of 'War 2' sparked massive celebrations and fanfare among fans of actor Jr NTR, who plays a leading role in the Bollywood film. But while most of the celebrations involved fans throwing confetti showers in the theatres, coupled with cheering, dancing and cheering, one viral incident has raised serious safety concerns.The incident in question features a man lighting up a 'flame thrower' inside the theatre. The frenzy began with Jr NTR’s much-hyped entry scene where the superstar ‘flies’ onto the screen via a drone, landing shirtless on a ship and flaunting his chiselled eight-pack abs. As the crowd erupts, he is introduced on-screen as the “Man of the Masses.” While others in the audience threw confetti, applauded and whistled, one group of fans rushed to the front of the theatre and raised eyebrows with their unruly behaviour. Viral VideoIn the footage, a group of enthusiastic fans is seen dancing near the screen with posters, when one man appears to ignite what looks like a flamethrower. It remains unclear whether he used a lighter and deodorant spray to create the flame effect or if he actually brought a flamethrower to the theatre, but the stunt has raised alarm over the potential risk to fellow moviegoers.Safety ConcernsSocial media reactions have been mixed. While some brushed it off as part of the celebration, many netizens slammed the behaviour, pointing out the fire dangers. “This could have gone horribly wrong,” one user commented.Similar Past ReactionsThis is not the first time that Bollywood films have seen such celebrations turn hazardous. In 2023, Salman Khan fans made headlines for lighting fireworks inside a theatre during 'Tiger 3' screening at Mohan Cinema in Malegaon, Maharashtra. The incident, which included rockets and string bombs ignited in the front rows, caused panic among audiences and led to calls for stricter safety enforcement in cinemas. The viral video even prompted Salman to put out a tweet warning fans about the dangers of such actions.Box Office Performance'War 2' recorded a massive Rs 52.50 crore debut at the box office, and according to early estiamtes on Day 2, the film has added another Rs 8.33 crore to its kitty. This takes the Hrithik Roshan, Jr NTR and Kiara Advani starrer’s total earnings to Rs 60.83 crore in just two days.The film, which is part of YRF’s lucrative Spy Universe, has been drawing audiences with its high-octane action sequences and the first-time pairing of Hrithik and Jr NTR. While the Hindi version’s opening fell short of expectations, the Telugu dubbed version has emerged as a key contributor, powered by Jr NTR’s massive fan following in the South.With the Independence Day holiday driving higher footfalls across the country, trade analysts predict a strong upward trajectory for the weekend, with the potential to cross the Rs 100 crore mark. However, competition from Rajinikanth’s 'Coolie' in southern markets remains a factor to watch in the days ahead."Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
