He candidly discussed his divorce from Kristen Corley on a podcast, emphasizing their commitment to co-parenting their two daughters, Kensli and Marlie.  Chance the Rapper is gearing up to release his new album, Star Line, on August 15, 2025. In a recent interaction, he revealed details of his upcoming And We Back tour, set to kick off in September 2025 in support of the album. However, it’s not just his music making headlines. During an appearance on the New Rory & Mal podcast, the rapper also spoke candidly about his personal life and his divorce from Kristen Corley.Split after five years of marriageChance and Kristen parted ways in 2024 after being married for five years. He shared that he’s currently in a “transition” period and still learning and growing.Love and Family Bonds RemainDespite their split, Chance said they “definitely love each other.” Coming from a close-knit family, he believes it’s important for him, Kristen, and their families to stay connected and get along well.Separation from Kristen CorleyChance revealed that even though they’re separated, he and Kristen still travel together, but their relationship has a very different dynamic now.From deep love to divorceThe two first met at the age of nine and tied the knot in 2019. They have two daughters, Kensli (9) and Marlie (5). Chance and Kristen shared a strong bond, but five years into their marriage, they faced challenges they couldn’t overcome. This eventually led to what Chance describes as an “amicable” divorce.A Difficult JourneySpeaking on the New Rory & Mal podcast, Chance admitted, "I ain't gonna act like it’s not tough. I ain’t gonna act like it’s perfect and we shook hands and dipped. It’s weird. I think the toughness is that it’s a reality. I think that’s the toughest part. You might feel like you’re over it, and you’re not over it. Or you might be used to a certain pattern of operating, and because it doesn’t work like that, you have to allow yourself grace to deal with that and operate in reality."Mutual respectChance shared that he and Kristen maintain mutual respect, which allows them to keep a friendly relationship. They often visit the same places and see each other at least every other week. He noted that, unlike some separated couples who completely cut off contact.Connected through their kidsChance explained that having children means he and Kristen will always share an emotional connection. He compared it to a Venn diagram, where they are both linked through the same centre, their kids. While admitting they may not be the most emotionally mature people, he said they share the understanding that helps them avoid letting conflicts go too far. He added that he’s grateful to have a co-parent who shares this mindset.Chance The Rapper is such a family man!"Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
