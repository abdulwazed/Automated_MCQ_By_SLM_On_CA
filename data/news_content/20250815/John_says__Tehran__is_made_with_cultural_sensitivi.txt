Abraham emphasizes the film's sensitivity in portraying Iran and Israel, aiming for balance and avoiding exaggerated action. He believes 'Tehran' is a significant Indian film, exploring diverse cultures and languages.  John Abraham, the Bollywood hunk, is known for bringing his ‘A’ game with every action thriller, and ‘Tehran’ is no exception. However, this time, he has walked an extra mile, as ‘Tehran’ is not your typical gun-blazing spectacle; this time, the high-stakes thriller spans countries, colours, and languages. “‘Tehran,’ I can confidently say, is one of the most significant and biggest international films out of India,” said John Abraham in his exclusive conversation with us.“We’ve spoken different languages, explored different cultures, and it’s been a fantastic experience,” added the actor.John Abraham reveals why he says no to bollywood parties—and yes to a 4 am wake-up callThe film is set primarily in Iran, and John Abraham has a personal connection to the country, as his mother has relatives there. When asked if his connection helped him to understand the subject matter better, the actor shared, “I believe Iran is arguably the most misrepresented country in the world.” John Abraham says the film has been crafted with sincerityHe continued, “Yes, of course, there’s a big question mark over the regime, but the people of Iran are beautiful—and that’s what I believe. We still have cousins there, and it’s a place I would want to visit. Naturally, I want to see a deeply balanced film. In our film, we’ve been very sensitive to how people feel about Iran, how people feel about Israel—especially since some of my closest friends are from Israel—and also how India is portrayed."Speaking on the subject of sensitivity, the actor also highlighted that to stay true to the movie, the team avoided any stylized or exaggerated action. “There was a temptation to go over the top, to add in those action sequences. But we steered clear of that and made the most honest film we could," concluded John Abraham.About ‘Tehran’Based on the 2012 attacks on Israeli diplomats, ‘Tehran’ is an Arun Gopalan directorial. Released on Zee5 on August 14, the movie stars John Abraham, Neeru Bajwa, and Manushi Chhillar in the lead roles.
