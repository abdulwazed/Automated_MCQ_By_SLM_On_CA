In an interview on Aap Ki Adalat, the Jawan star admitted, “Sometimes I feel very sad, I even feel like crying, that I should be made to say that I belong to this country, I am a patriot.” These remarks came during a period of intense public scrutiny, and his quiet dignity in the face of such adversity highlighted his firm belief that patriotism shouldn't be a competition.SRK on urging the youth to rise above divisionIn that heartfelt interview, SRK also directed a powerful message to the younger generation.

He called India "the greatest country in the world," highlighting its safety, beauty, and unity. For him, true patriotism lies in working hard and contributing to the nation's future, not in getting trapped in "small, petty matters" that divide the country.
