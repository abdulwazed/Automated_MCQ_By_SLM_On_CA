"Six or seven planes came down. They were ready to go. Maybe nuclear. We solved that," Trump said about the India-Pakistan tension. Air Chief Marshal Staff Amar Preet Singh recently said India shot down five Pakistani fighter jets and one other large aircraft during Operation Sindoor. Pakistan rejected the claim. Trump again claimed he solved the India-Pakistan tension. US President Donald Trump again claimed he brokered peace between India and Pakistan when the countries were probably going "nuclear". The statement came as Trump is all set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday in Alaska to settle the Russia-Ukraine war. As Trump spoke about the negotiations he facilitated since coming to power, he mentioned India and Pakistan, though India repeatedly rejected Trump's ceasefire claims. "I've solved six wars in the last six months, little more than six months now. And I'm very proud of it. We had one war raging, as you know, for 37 years. One in the Congo with Rwanda was raging for 31 years. We solved six of them. Made peace, not just solved them. If you look at Pakistan and India. Planes were being knocked out of the air. Six or seven planes came down. They were ready to go. Maybe nuclear. We solved that," Trump said. Air Chief Marshal Staff Amar Preet Singh recently said India shot down five Pakistani fighter jets and one other large aircraft during Operation Sindoor. Pakistan rejected the claim. On his Alaska meeting, Trump said the more important meeting will be the second meeting he will have with Putin after he sets the stage at the first meeting. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and some of the European leaders may take part in the second meeting, apart from him and Putin."I think President Putin will make peace, President Zelenskyy will make peace. We will see if they can get along. And if they can, it will be great. Trump said he thought solving the Russia-Ukraine war would be the easiest one, but it's actually the most difficult one. This war has no reason and would have never started, had he been the president, Trump said reiterating that the Russia-Ukraine war is Biden's war.
