Trent Alexander-Arnold, Lamine Yamal and Julian Alvarez (Images via Getty Images) With Real Madrid aiming to wrestle the Spanish title back from champions Barcelona, here's a look at five talking points as the La Liga season begins on Friday.Alonso's challengeCarlo Ancelotti's Real Madrid were dismantled on a regular basis by rivals Barcelona last season, who triumphed in all four meetings between the sides as well as winning La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the Spanish Super Cup.The Italian departed, to be replaced by former Madrid midfielder Xabi Alonso, who has work on his hands to help revive them despite a squad boasting numerous star names including Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior.Madrid were thrashed 4-0 by Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup semi-finals and it remains to be seen how playing in the competition will impact squad fatigue and preparation for the new season.Defenders Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dean Huijsen give Alonso more options than Ancelotti had last season, along with Dani Carvajal's return from a long-term knee injury.However Madrid could be short in midfield after Luka Modric's departure and with Jude Bellingham set to be out until October after shoulder surgery.Can Yamal maintain level?Lamine Yamal, now 18 and wearing No 10, will carry the weight of his side's success going into the new season (Photo by Alex Caparros/Getty Images)Barcelona excelled in attack last season and much of that was down to skilful teenage star Lamine Yamal.The Spain international turned 18 in July and has already made over 100 appearances for the club, becoming the Catalans' key player going forward.If Flick's side are to defend their title and push on for more in the Champions League, as they prepare to return to their rebuilt Camp Nou stadium, the winger maintaining his world-class level is essential.Yamal took former Barca all-time great Lionel Messi's number 10 shirt in July and insists he is forging his own path at the club.After helping his country triumph at Euro 2024, Yamal will also have his eye on the 2026 World Cup next summer.If new arrival Marcus Rashford hits the ground running coach Hansi Flick may be able to give Yamal the occasional rest, moving Raphinha over to the right. Atletico reshuffleAfter a poor end to the previous campaign and a surprise group stage Club World Cup elimination, Diego Simeone's Atletico took action this summer.They brought in playmaker Alex Baena from Villarreal and Real Betis' Johnny Cardoso to provide new midfield impetus, as well as several other new recruits.Long-time Atletico players Angel Correa, Rodrigo De Paul, Saul Niguez depart, among others.Despite the strength of their squad and Simeone's reputation as one of the best coaches in the world -- and the highest paid in Europe -- Atletico have won just three trophies in the last decade, La Liga in 2021 and both the Europa League and the UEFA Super Cup in 2018.Questions over whether Simeone has taken them as far as he can will quickly rear up if things start to go wrong. Cazorla's OviedoSpanish midfield maestro Santi Cazorla penned a new one-year deal with Real Oviedo for their return to Spain's top flight after a 24-year absence.It is a miraculous finale for the 40-year-old -- a member of the Spain side that won the 2008 and 2012 Euro titles -- who came close to losing his right leg due to his ankle bone going soft when he was at Arsenal. Former Arsenal playmaker Cazorla had a key role in the team's rise to La Liga, when he re-joined them he initially offered to play for nothing but was obliged under the rules to accept the minimum wage, and in their first match they take on his former side Villarreal.Whether he will be able to have as much of an impact this season is debatable but Cazorla will get a fine send-off at grounds around the country when Oviedo hit the road.Fresh startsReal Sociedad and Sevilla have made new managerial appointments as they try to bounce back from poor 2024-25 campaigns.After seven years at the helm Real's Imanol Alguacil stepped down and has been replaced by reserve team coach Sergio Francisco.PollWho do you think will win La Liga this season?BarcelonaReal MadridAtletico MadridAnother teamMeanwhile Matias Almeyda takes over at a Sevilla side which finished 17th last season and sacked coach Francesco Garcia Pimienta in April.Both clubs have been among the strongest in Spain over the past decade but have fallen from grace.Real Sociedad in particular will have to find a way to move forward after the departure of key midfielder Martin Zubimendi to Arsenal.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
