PM Modi pays tribute to Rajghat NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday greeted the nation on its 79th Independence Day and urged everyone to work even harder to build a developed Bharat."Wishing everyone a very happy Independence Day. May this day inspire us to keep working even harder to realise the dreams of our freedom fighters and build a Viksit Bharat. Jai Hind," Modi said in a post on X.Key points:PM Modi will be addressing the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort for the 12th time. Ahead of the address, the Prime Minister visited Rajghat and paid his tribute.In his 98-minute address on August 15 in 2024, he had made an unequivocal pitch for a "secular" civil code instead of the current framework which is "communal" and promoted "discrimination", and also for simultaneous polls.He had announced that 75,000 more medical seats will be created in the country in the next five years.Social ills like crimes against women have also figured prominently in some of his speeches, and so are his push for cleanliness and empowerment of women and traditionally disadvantaged communities.Political watchers will eagerly look out for any signalling from him on the foreign policy front at a time when India's generally solid ties with the US are under strain amid Trump's repeated claims of mediating cease fire between India and Pakistan and use of tariff to pressure India on trade.Trump's decision to single out India for high tariff of 50 per cent, his occasional praise of Pakistan and ceasefire claims have given the opposition fodder to attack the Modi government.With Parliament's Monsoon session continuing and marred by disruption from the Opposition, which has alleged poll irregularities and demanded a discussion on the Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls in poll-bound Bihar, it will be seen with interest whether the prime minister responds to the allegations.His government's muscular stand against Pakistan-sponsored terrorism and naxalism has been a regular highlight in Modi's annual speeches, and this year is unlikely to be any different.The prime minister had sought suggestions from citizens for his address, and it will be keenly watched if some of these ideas make it to his speech.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
