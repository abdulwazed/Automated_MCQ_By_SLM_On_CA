Offering incentives to both first-time employees and employers, the programme aims to lower hiring costs, formalise jobs, boost workplace mobility, and spur economic growth across sectors, especially in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. Prime Minister Narendra Modi Independence Day Speech Independence Day speeches often stir emotion; this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address also carried a clear, data-backed economic intent. From the Red Fort, beneath the sweep of the tricolour, he unveiled the Pradhan Mantri Viksit Bharat Rozgar Yojana (PM-VBRY), a ₹99,446 crore national jobs drive that could directly shape the careers of millions and recalibrate India’s labour market dynamics.“Today, I bring good news for the youth of our country. From today, under the PM Viksit Bharat Rozgar Yojana, sons and daughters getting their first job in the private sector will be given ₹15,000,” he announced.The scheme began on August 1, 2025, replacing the Employment Linked Incentive Scheme. Its ambitions are unmistakable: 3.5 crore new jobs in two years, including 1.92 crore for first-time entrants. But beyond the headline numbers lies a design that could ripple through boardrooms, shop floors, and HR departments, reshaping how India works.What is PM Viksit Bharat Rozgar Yojana?The scheme operates on two fronts. First, individuals securing their first private sector job with a monthly salary of up to ₹1 lakh will receive incentives of up to ₹15,000, disbursed in two instalments, the first after six months, and the second after one year, contingent on attending a financial awareness programme. A portion of this incentive will be earmarked in a savings account to cultivate long-term saving habits.Second, employers expanding their workforce will receive subsidies of up to ₹3,000 per month per new hire for two years, with manufacturing units eligible for benefits for up to four years. This applies to employers registered with the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) who add at least two employees (if the workforce is under 50) or five employees (if over 50).Two-way incentives: Why it matters for working professionalsUnlike one-sided job schemes, PM-VBRY incentivises both employees and employers:For first-time employees: A ₹15,000 payout (split over one year) is more than a welcome cash infusion — it’s a bridge into formal employment. The financial literacy training attached to the benefit could equip young workers with budgeting skills, savings discipline, and an early grasp of provident fund and insurance systems. This matters in a country where household financial planning often starts too late.For existing working professionals: The employer incentive of ₹3,000 per new hire per month — for up to two years (four for manufacturing) — could indirectly boost existing staff morale and career mobility. Companies expanding headcount often create internal promotions, team expansions, and upskilling opportunities for current employees, breaking the stagnation many mid-level professionals face.For gig and contract workers: By requiring EPFO registration for participating employers, the scheme subtly nudges firms to formalise roles, opening the door to social security for those currently outside the safety net.Job growth mechanics: How PM-VBRY could trigger expansionThe scheme’s architecture aligns neatly with the realities of India’s post-pandemic labour market:Lower hiring costs = Higher recruitment appetiteWage subsidies can make the marginal cost of a new hire 15–20% cheaper for employers, particularly in labour-intensive manufacturing, retail, and logistics. This is a significant hiring catalyst in sectors where payroll costs deter expansion.First-job bonus = Reduced attritionYoung employees with a financial incentive tied to staying six months to a year are less likely to leave prematurely. Lower churn rates mean companies spend less on constant rehiring and training.Boost to Tier-2 and Tier-3 citiesEPFO-registered firms in smaller towns stand to gain from easier recruitment, potentially decentralising job growth from metros to emerging industrial and service hubs.Multiplier effect in allied industriesJob creation in manufacturing and services naturally fuels demand in transport, food services, education, and housing, creating a second wave of indirect employment.The hard numbers: Debunking the gloom narrativeThe timing of PM-VBRY also challenges the “jobless growth” perception peddled by selective opinion polls. The NSO’s Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) — the gold-standard, ILO-recognised dataset — reports:Unemployment rate (15+) down from 6.0% in 2017–18 to 3.2% in 2023–24.Labour Force Participation Rate up from 49.8% to 60.1%.Youth unemployment down to 10.2%, below the global average of 13.3% (ILO, 2024).16.83 crore new jobs added between 2017–18 and 2023–24 (RBI KLEMS database).Formalisation is accelerating: 1.29 crore net EPFO subscribers joined in 2024–25, compared to 61.12 lakh in 2018–19.Beyond numbers: Why professionals should pay attentionThe PM-VBRY is not just for freshers; it could reshape the employment culture in ways that affect experienced professionals:Faster company growth means more vertical movement and the chance to lead expanding teams.Formalisation push means better HR compliance, predictable pay cycles, and benefits coverage.Geographical spread of jobs could give skilled professionals more location flexibility without sacrificing salary levels.A lever for the demographic dividendIndia’s demographic advantage, 65% of its population under 35, is both an asset and a challenge. Without structured entry points into the formal workforce, young potential can easily turn into a demographic liability. PM-VBRY, by directly rewarding hiring and retention, aims to convert that potential into productivity.If implemented with rigour, and paired with existing skilling programmes like Skill India, PMEGP, and the NEP 2020 framework, the scheme could become a pivot point in India’s employment story, one that working professionals will feel in promotions, pay cheques, and workplace dynamism over the next two years.Ready to navigate global policies?
