File Pic: Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar NEW DELHI: Former India opener Virender Sehwag has revealed that he came close to retiring from ODI cricket in 2007-08, only to be convinced otherwise by batting legend Sachin Tendulkar.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Speaking on Padamjeet Sehrawat's podcast, Sehwag recalled the turbulent phase during India's tri-nation series against Australia and Sri Lanka Down Under, when he was dropped from the side by captain MS Dhoni after the first three matches.Sachin Tendulkar at 52: Power, Pride, and a Nation’s Pulse“In the 2007-08 series against Australia, I played the first three matches and then MS Dhoni dropped me from the side. I wasn't picked for a while after that. Then I felt that if I can't be a part of the playing XI, then there is no point in playing ODI cricket,” Sehwag said.PollDo you think Sehwag made the right decision to continue playing ODIs?Absolutely!Not really.Frustrated and ready to walk away, Sehwag approached Tendulkar to share his decision. What followed was a conversation that changed the course of his career.“I went to Tendulkar and said, ‘I am thinking of retiring from ODIs'. He said, ‘No. I went through a similar phase in 1999-2000, where I felt I should leave cricket. But that phase came and went. You are going through a trough, but it will pass. Don't make any decision when you are emotional. Give yourself some time and 1-2 series, and then take a call.'”Sehwag took the advice to heart, returned to the side, scored heavily in the following series, and went on to play a crucial role in India's 2011 World Cup-winning campaign.Sehwag went on to play 251 ODIs for India, amassing 8,273 runs at an average of 35.05 and a strike rate of 104.33, including 15 centuries and 38 fifties. Sehwag’s message for son AyraveerThe former opener also spoke about his son Aryaveer's budding cricket journey. Selected for Delhi's U-16 Vijay Merchant Trophy squad in December 2023, Aryaveer, Sehwag said, would inevitably face comparisons but should not take on undue pressure.“That pressure will always be on you, but you should not take that pressure. Pressure is something that you give, not take… Hope he goes on to play either for India or the Ranji Trophy,” Sehwag remarked.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
