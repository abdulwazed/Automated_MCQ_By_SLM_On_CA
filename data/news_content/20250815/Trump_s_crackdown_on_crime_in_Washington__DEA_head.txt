This move rescinded directives by the city's police chief, Pamela Smith, that limited immigration inquiries and arrests based on federal warrants.  US Attorney General Pam Bondi has appointed Terry Cole, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), as Washington’s “emergency police commissioner,” granting him the powers of the police chief amid the federal takeover.On Thursday, Bondi , in a directive notice, said that Cole will assume “powers and duties vested in the District of Columbia Chief of Police.” She added that the Metropolitan Police Department “must receive approval from Commissioner Cole” before issuing any orders, AP reported.The Attorney General has rescinded a directive issued by Pamela Smith, the city's current police chief, that required MPD officers to share information with immigration agencies concerning individuals not in custody, such as those involved in traffic stops or checkpoints. Bondi stated that she was revoking that order along with other MPD policies that limited inquiries into immigration status and prevented arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants. "All new directives must now receive approval from Cole," the Attorney General said. The late-night announcement followed an eventful day in the ongoing federal operation. Smith's earlier directive effectively aligned Trump's initiatives on city law enforcement with his nationwide efforts to curb immigration, and Trump had commended it in the hours preceding Bondi's declaration. “That’s a very positive thing, I have heard that just happened,” Trump said of Smith’s order. “That’s a great step. That’s a great step if they’re doing that.” The police chief increased cooperation between her officers and federal immigration officials as President Donald Trump’s law enforcement takeover of the nation’s capital took root Thursday. National Guard troops watched over some of the world’s most renowned landmarks and Humvees took up position in front of the busy main train station.  The White House said 45 arrests were made Wednesday night, with 29 people arrested for living in the country illegally; other arrests included for distribution or possession of drugs, carrying a concealed weapon and assaulting a federal officer. Troops were stationed outside the Union Station transportation hub as the 800 Guard members activated by Trump begin missions that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts, the Pentagon said. “They will remain until law and order has been restored in the District as determined by the president, standing as the gatekeepers of our great nation’s capital,” Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said. “The National Guard is uniquely qualified for this mission as a community-based force with strong local ties and disciplined training.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
