Combining spinach with citrus boosts iron bioavailability, while tomatoes and olive oil maximize lycopene absorption. Garlic and honey preserve allicin's benefits, and turmeric with black pepper dramatically increases curcumin absorption, optimizing your diet's nutritional value.  Your health and wellness start with what you eat. Eating healthy is, however, not just about what you eat, but how you eat. While diet plays a crucial role in your well-being, the way you combine, prepare, and enjoy it is of paramount importance. Pairing certain foods with others can boost nutrition. Dr. Will Bulsiewicz, a leading gastroenterologist and gut health expert, has shared four powerful food pairings that will help you absorb more nutrients and improve gut health. Let’s take a look. Beat belly fat with millets: Easy breakfast ideas for quick weight lossSpinach and citrusSpinach, as we all know, is an excellent source of iron. But spinach has non-heme iron, which is a form of iron that the body cannot absorb efficiently when compared to heme iron from animal sources. So how do you increase its bioavailability? Dr. Bulsiewicz suggests adding citrus to it. “When you add a source of vitamin C to spinach, like a squeeze of lemon or some orange segments, it transforms the iron in spinach into a more bioavailable form, helping boost your energy and prevent iron deficiency,” the gut doctor explains.Tomatoes and olive oilEver wondered why your Nonna Pia adds olive oil to sauté the tomatoes? Well, it's more than just amping up the flavour. The generational knowledge passed down to her is rooted in science! Tomatoes contain lycopene, which is a fat-soluble antioxidant compound that reduces the risk of heart disease by slashing oxidative stress. “But it's not that easy to absorb until you combine it with extra virgin olive oil. The fat from the extra virgin olive oil actually helps you to get more of the lycopene from the tomatoes,” the doctor adds.

Allicin is so good for us. But the problem is, it breaks down very quickly,” Dr. Bulsiewicz says. The best way to preserve the benefits of garlic is to add honey to it. “If you add raw honey, it can actually help to preserve the allicin while also offering its own benefits for your immune system and your gut health,” the doctor reveals. Turmeric and black pepperTurmeric and black pepper are indeed a match made in heaven! Turmeric contains a compound called curcumin, which has anti-inflammatory properties. However, it’s poorly absorbed on its own. “Turmeric is a wonderful spice and curry that has these powerful anti-inflammatory polyphenols called curcumin. The problem is, curcumin is not absorbed very easily. But what you could do is combine this with black pepper, which has piperine,” the doctor says. When you add black pepper to turmeric, its bioavailability increases by up to 2,000%. Yes, that’s indeed a dramatic boost. “These combinations aren’t gimmicks. They’re simple, evidence-based strategies to help you get more from the foods you already enjoy,” he adds.
