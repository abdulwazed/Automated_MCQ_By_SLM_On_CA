Newsom has called for the resignation of Harvard University President Alan M. Garber over reports that the University is nearing a settlement with the Trump administration. Newsom's remarks were posted on social media platform X, where he criticised Harvard's ongoing negotiations with the White House regarding the restoration of research funding."An absolute failure of leadership that will have demonstrable impacts to higher education across our country," Newsom wrote, as reported by The Harvard Crimson. He added, "He should be ashamed," referring to Garber. Newsom's statement follows increasing criticism from Democratic politicians and affiliates who oppose any settlement with the current US administration.Harvard reportedly in final stages of deal with Trump administrationHarvard University and the Trump administration resumed negotiations in June to restore billions of dollars in research funding. According to reports from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, the White House is demanding a settlement of approximately $500 million, and discussions are reportedly in the final stages.Newsom's post came amid broader concerns over similar deals between the federal government and Ivy League institutions. Columbia University and Brown University reached settlements earlier this summer, with Columbia agreeing to pay $200 million and submit to federal oversight, including restrictions on student protests and a review of academic programmes. Brown committed $50 million to a workforce development initiative in Rhode Island.As reported by The Harvard Crimson, Democratic lawmakers, including 14 Harvard alumni in Congress, warned the University of a potential investigation should it proceed with the agreement. Critics argue that Harvard's compliance would set a precedent for future federal demands on academic institutions.Newsom joins other Democrats in opposing dealNewsom, considered a potential Democratic presidential candidate for 2028, joined a growing number of politicians expressing opposition to the deal. In a separate post quoted by The Harvard Crimson, Newsom wrote, "You don't work with Donald Trump — only FOR Donald Trump," and added, "Looks like Harvard has chosen to surrender."Newsom's office did not respond to a request for comment, and Harvard officials have declined to comment on the situation, according to The Harvard Crimson.Trump administration also targets California universityNewsom's statements were also tied to reports that the Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in exchange for the restoration of over $500 million in research funding. A federal judge has since ordered the funding to be reinstated.As per The Harvard Crimson, Newsom responded, "CALIFORNIA WILL NEVER BEND THE KNEE," and has threatened to initiate legal action, adding to the 37 lawsuits California has filed against the administration.Harvard's initial resistance and growing internal oppositionEarlier in the year, Harvard refused demands from the Trump administration and subsequently filed two lawsuits. This resistance was publicly supported by the Cambridge City Council and Massachusetts Democrats, according to The Harvard Crimson.However, reports from The Harvard Crimson indicate that internal divisions persist. While some faculty members view a potential agreement as pragmatic, others have voiced strong opposition. Groups such as Crimson Courage and Students for Freedom have circulated open letters urging the University to reject political interference. Crimson Courage's letter stated, "We cannot stand for ‘veritas' if we refuse to stand up for truth when the moment demands it."Harvard's chapter of the American Association of University Professors also warned, "Extortion payments are rarely a one-time affair," as reported by The Harvard Crimson.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.
