Eyelid twitching suggests magnesium deficiency. Clicking joints may warn of vitamin D3 or calcium shortage. Premature graying links to vitamin B12 or copper problems. Easy bruising signals vitamin C or K1 deficiency. Addressing these signs prevents bigger health problems.  The human body is more miraculous than we understand. When an illness or deficiency sneaks in, it gives you signs. These signs appear even before they show up in the lab tests. Your body needs essential vitamins and minerals to function properly. But when it falls short, the body sends signals. These signs could be subtle and easy to dismiss. Dr. Saurabh Sethi, a California-based gastroenterologist, has now emphasized the importance of catching these signs early and correcting them before they lead to bigger health issues.Brittle nailsIf someone has a problem with breaking nails or strange ridges, the body might be craving protein or iron. Protein is essential for nail strength, and iron helps carry oxygen to the nail beds. Low iron levels can leave the nails weak and pale. Time to load up on eggs, spinach, nuts, and lean meats!  How strong are your nails? Well, not the fake ones, your real ones. Well, the strength of your nails can really tell a lot about your health. Dr. Sethi notes that brittle nails are a sign of protein and iron deficiency in your diet. If your nails are breaking very often and are thin, it is important to look into it. Iron plays a crucial role in helping deliver oxygen to cells. Protein, on the other hand, is the building block for keratin, the main component of nails. Eyelids or lid twitchingFrequent muscle cramps, especially in the legs, can be another indicator of kidney disease. This happens due to: Imbalances in key minerals like calcium, phosphorus, and potassium. Poor regulation of electrolytes by the kidneys, leading to sudden cramps and muscle pain.While dehydration can also cause cramps, persistent muscle spasms might suggest an underlying kidney issue.If you complain about a sudden spasm in your leg, it could be more than fatigue. A lack of adequate magnesium in your body can lead to muscle twitches. Similarly, the involuntary eyelid twitching is also a sign of magnesium deficiency. Magnesium has a pivotal role in transmitting nerve impulses and supporting muscle function.Clicking sound at the joints Do you hear a clicking sound from your knees when you sit or rise from a seated position? Well, it is not nothing. Dr. Sethi says that this could be a warning sign of vitamin D3 or calcium deficiency. These nutrients are essential for bone density and joint health. A deficiency can cause this audible sound in the joints.Premature grayingAre you struggling with premature graying? Well, genetics does play a major role in hair colour, however, early graying may also be linked to nutrient deficiencies. Dr. Sethi explains that premature graying could be due to vitamin B12 or copper deficiency. “Vitamin B12 is crucial for RBC production and oxygen transport at the hair follicles. This could also be a sign of copper deficiency, which is responsible for melanin production, imparting color to your hair,” he adds. Nutrient Power: How Vitamins Affect Hair Growth, Skin, and Nail HealthEasy bruisingDo you get hurt very easily? If you notice bruises very often on your body, it is a crucial sign of nutrient deficiency. This is a sign that your body may be low in vitamin C or vitamin K1. Vitamin C is responsible for collagen formation, which keeps blood vessels strong, while vitamin K1 plays a key role in blood clotting.Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.
