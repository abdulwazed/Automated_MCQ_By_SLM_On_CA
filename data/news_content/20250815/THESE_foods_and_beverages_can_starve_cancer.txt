Dr. William Li highlights the significance of dietary choices in cancer prevention, emphasizing that certain foods can starve cancer cells. Coffee, tea, Brassica vegetables, beans, legumes, and omega-3-rich seafood are recommended for their anti-inflammatory and blood supply-cutting properties. Incorporating these foods into the diet may lower the risk of developing various cancers, including colorectal cancer. Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. In 2020, cancer led to nearly 10 million deaths, which is one in six deaths, according to the World Health Organisation. While several factors increase the risk of cancer, the WHO says, 30% and 50% of cancers are preventable. One lifestyle change that can reduce the risk of cancer, is eating the right foods. Dr. William Li is a world-renowned physician and author known for revolutionary theories of disease prevention through the power of eating right, has shared a list of foods that can starve cancer. Take a look. Want to live longer? Science says eating more protein might be the answerAdd coffee and tea to the menu Yes, that’s right, popular beverages, coffee and tea, do more than just wake you up. Coffee contains chlorogenic acid, which lowers inflammation and starves the cancer cells. Tea, especially green tea, contains polyphenols called catechins, which, according to Dr. Li, cut off the blood supply to cancer. “For example, the Shanghai Women’s Health Study followed 69,000 women and found that those who drank tea at least 3 times per week had a 37% reduction in the risk for colon cancer, compared to women who didn’t drink green tea. How you steep your tea can make a difference. The more you steep, the more natural cancer-fighting substances from the tea leaves are released into your cup!” Dr. Li said in his blog. Brassica vegetablesLoad your plate with vegetables from the Brassica genus within the Brassicaceae family. According to Dr. Li, Brassica vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, kale, and arugula are potent cancer-fighting foods. These vegetables contain isothiocyanates, specifically sulforaphanes, which are natural chemicals that can cut off the blood supply feeding cancer and also lower inflammation.Eat your beansDr. Li also stressed the importance of adding beans and legumes to your diet. They are an excellent way to starve cancer cells. Beans and legumes, such as white beans, black beans, pinto beans, chickpeas, soybeans and edamame, are rich in dietary fiber, which has been linked to a lower risk of colorectal cancer.Omega-3s for the winImagine eating delectable fish recipes to beat cancer. Sounds like a dream, right? Dr. Li emphasizes the importance of adding seafood to the diet. Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, seafood is linked to lower inflammation. “We used to think it was only salmon or lower on the food chain like anchovies and sardines, mackerel, but in fact, even cod and halibut and even shrimp and shellfish like mussels and clams, they also have healthy omega-3s,” he said. “All of this can contribute to lowering your risk of developing cancers, including colorectal cancer,” he adds.

Those also lower inflammation and have cancer-starving properties as well,” he said.
