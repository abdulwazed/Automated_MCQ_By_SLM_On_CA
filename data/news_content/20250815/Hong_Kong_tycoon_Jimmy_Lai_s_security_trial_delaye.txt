Hong Kong tycoon Jimmy Lai (AP) HONG KONG: Hong Kong postponed media mogul Jimmy Lai's trial on Friday, awaiting a heart monitoring device -- the second delay this week to the democracy campaigner's case.The 77-year-old founder of the Apple Daily newspaper is charged with foreign collusion under Hong Kong's national security law, which Beijing imposed following huge and sometimes violent democracy protests in 2019.Closing arguments in the long-running trial were originally expected to begin Thursday, but all court sessions were suspended by heavy rain.As court resumed Friday, defence lawyer Robert Pang said that Lai had heart "palpitations" and experienced the feeling of "collapsing".Lai has been kept behind bars since December 2020, reportedly in solitary confinement, and concerns have previously been raised over the septuagenarian's welfare. Pang told AFP that the defence has requested Lai be excused from the closing arguments, as he is not required to speak."(Lai) believes the episodes will occur when he is fatigued, and coming to court fatigues him," Pang said. Judge Esther Toh said Lai should not worry about disturbing the court and could always speak up if he was uncomfortable.Prison-arranged medical staff had detected "no abnormality" with Lai's heart but had nevertheless arranged for a wearable heart monitor and medication, Toh said.Judge Alex Lee said it would be "prudent" to begin proceedings on Monday after the medical arrangements were sorted.- 'The world is watching' -The sprawling trial, which began in December 2023, is entering its final stages as Western nations and rights groups continue to call for Lai's release.Aside from the foreign collusion offence -- which could land him in prison for life -- Lai is also charged with "seditious publication" related to 161 op-eds.The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said Thursday that "the world is watching how Hong Kong treats its journalists".US President Donald Trump told a Fox News radio programme on Thursday that he had previously brought up the Lai case with Chinese President Xi Jinping."I'm going to do everything I can to save him... you could also understand President Xi would not be exactly thrilled," the outlet quoted Trump as saying.The Hong Kong government said Wednesday it "strongly disapproved and rejected the slanderous remarks made by external forces" regarding Lai's case.Lai is a British citizen and his son Sebastien has called on the government to do more, saying: "I don't want my father to die in jail."- 'Political prisoner' -Lai has given spirited testimony over more than 50 days, fielding questions about his political ideology, management style and overseas contacts.He described himself at least twice as a "political prisoner", which drew sharp rebukes from the three-judge panel.Prosecutors showed the court a diagram titled "(Lai's) external political connections", arguing that he had exerted influence in the United States, Britain and Taiwan.Lai has denied calling for sanctions against China and Hong Kong and said he never advocated separatism.Apple Daily was forced to close in 2021 after police raids and the arrests of its senior editors.A former Apple Daily employee surnamed Chang queued outside court on Friday to support Lai, describing him as a "caring" boss."His health worsened after he was taken into custody, but I think his spirit is strong, and I hope he can persist," Chang told AFP.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousDivine baby names inspired by Lord KrishnaastrologyAshnoor Kaur’s top 10 ultra-glam lookstvRubina Dilaik's powerful reality show lookstvIn pic: Radiant pictures of Pooja HegdeEntertainment5 human body parts we may no longer need in the futureLifestyleBollywood-approved ethnic sets that are perfect for Independence Day 2025Lifestyle10 Stunning ethnic looks of Megha Shettytv10 celeb-inspired Indian baby girl namesLifestyleOne's own enemy: 8 animals that get triggered by their own reflectionLifestyleIndependence Day 2025: 10 inspiring lines on Freedom that warm the heartLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Beyond the Crown: Lara Dutta’s surprising life stories9 health benefits of potatoes (backed by science)Janmashtami 2025: 5 diabetes-friendly sweet recipes for Janmashtami bhog50 Years of Thalaivar: Rajinikanth’s iconic movies that fans cherish forever7 workout supplements every fitness enthusiast should know5 simple chia seed recipes that help in weight loss5 foods that can lower the chances of getting a strokeWhy Aarti has 5 flames: The deep meaning behind itIndia at 79: PM Modi leads Independence Day celebrations - In pics5 unique and must-have desserts made with eggs123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingLeBron JamesTom BradyDwyane WadeBrock Lesnar Net WorthPlayStation Plus GamesShedeur SanderStefon DiggsJoy TaylorNYU StudentsPatrick MahmoesTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire Website'Go back to where you came from': Staten Island crowd boos Zohran Mamdani- See videoToothbrush ban at ICE facility?
