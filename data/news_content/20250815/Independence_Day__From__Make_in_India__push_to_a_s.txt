PM Modi at Red Fort NEW DELHI: For the 12th consecutive time on Friday, from the ramparts of the Red Fort, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the nation with his longest 103-minute Independence Day speech.As he delivered the speech, the Prime Minister ensured he touched on every key aspect that has an overwhelming bearing on India's growth trajectory and its unrelentless pursuit of an ambitious future.The Prime Minister delivered a message to India and the world on prevailing challenges, emerging uncertainties, possible solutions, and the dream that Bharat envisions to realise by 2047, when India turns 100."My beloved citizens of India, this festival of independence is a festival of 140 crore resolutions. It is a moment of collective achievements, filled with pride and joy. The nation is continuously strengthening the spirit of unity. Today, 140 crore citizens are immersed in the colours of the Tiranga," PM Modi said at the commencement of his speech.Here are the top 10 messages from PM Modi's speechOn Operation SindoorRecalling the horrors of the massacre that took place at Baisaran meadow in Pahalgam on April 22, PM Modi said that Operation Sindoor carried out in retaliation was "an expression of anger"."Today, I'm witnessing a special significance on 15th August. I am proud that today, I got the opportunity to salute the brave soldiers of Operation Sindoor from the Red Fort. Our brave soldiers gave the enemies a fitting reply, beyond their imagination. Every Indian was angered by the horrors perpetrated by terrorists in Pahalgam. Operation Sindoor is the expression of that very anger," he said.PM said Pakistan still experiences trouble sleeping after Operation Sindoor, as the scale of destruction was so massive. "We gave our Armed Forces a free hand, allowing them to strategise, set the target, and decide the timing. Our forces set a precedent unseen for many decades. They attacked hundreds of kilometres into enemy territory and turned terrorist headquarters to dust. Pakistan’s sleep is still disturbed; the scale of destruction was immense," he said.On PakistanPM Modi reiterated in no uncertain terms that India, which has long been a victim of terrorism, would not differentiate between terrorists and those who shelter them, an indirect but pointed message to Islamabad.The Prime Minister also rebuffed the Pakistani army chief, who is de facto the ruler of the nuclear-armed nation, over a nuclear remark. PM said India would "no longer tolerate nuclear blackmail"."Our country has been bearing the pain of terrorism for many decades. We have now set a new normal. Terrorists and those who shelter them will not be seen separately. They are an equal danger to humanity with no difference. India will no longer tolerate nuclear blackmail. If the enemy dares to commit any more misadventure, the Indian Armed Forces will give them a befitting reply," PM Modi said. On the Indus Water TreatyPrime Minister Narendra Modi said India has decided that blood and water will not flow together and that India's share of water belongs to its farmers."The rivers of India were irrigating the enemy country while our own farmers were deprived of water. Now, the right over India’s share of water belongs only to India and its farmers. A compromise on farmers’ interests and national interests is not acceptable to us. Not anymore," PM Modi said.He further said: "India will absolutely not tolerate the continuation of the Indus Agreement in its current form. In the interest of farmers and the nation, this agreement is unacceptable to us."On Trump's tariffsIn a subtle but conspicuous message, PM Modi said he's standing like a wall in front of any policy that is against the interests of farmers, fishermen, cattle rearers of India," said PM Modi amid tariff row with the US. The United States President Donald Trump has imposed a 50% tariff on India as New Delhi continues to purchase crude oil from Russia."Modi is standing like a wall in front of any policy against the interest of our farmers, fishermen, cattle rearers of India," said PM Modi. "Today India is number one in the world in production of milk, pulses, jute. India is also the second-biggest fish producer. India is also the second-biggest producer of rice, wheat, fruits, vegetables. Export of agro-products worth 4 lakh crore has happened. Many schemes are there to support them. Farmers are becoming courageous with insurance," he added.On DemographyPM Modi said a conspiracy has been hatched to alter the country's demography and that infiltrators are snatching the livelihoods and seizing lands of tribals. "I wish to alert the nation today regarding a concern, a challenge. Under a conspiracy, the country's demography is being altered, sowing the seeds of a new crisis. Infiltrators are snatching the livelihoods of my country's youth, targeting my country's sisters and daughters; this will not be tolerated. These infiltrators are deceiving innocent tribals and seizing their lands; the nation will not endure this," PM Modi said.On NaxalismPM Modi said that areas earlier known as "red corridors" of Naxalism have now become green corridors of development."We know that a large part of our country was badly affected by Naxalism. The greatest loss was suffered by the tribal communities. The lives of young sons were ruined. There was a time when Naxalism had taken deep roots in over 125+ districts. Today, we have brought that number down to 20."He said: "There was a time when the mere mention of Bastar would bring to mind Naxalism, Maoism, and the sound of bombs and guns. Today, Bastar has freed itself from Naxalism and Maoism, and the youth of Bastar are participating in the Olympics". On SwadeshiPM Modi urged shopkeepers and traders to display boards for 'Swadeshi' products, urging citizens to "collectively make the Vocal for Local mantra a part of every citizen’s life"."We have carried out huge reforms in Income Tax laws, some people may have missed it amid din. Past decade was of reform, perform and transform; now we have to focus on greater goals. Want our traders, shopkeepers to display boards for 'Swadeshi' products," said PM Modi.I want to urge all influencers in the country to help me promote this mantra. I say to all political parties and all leaders, let’s come together...this is not the agenda of any political party, India belongs to all of us. Let us collectively make the Vocal for Local mantra a part of every citizen’s life.On India's space ambitionIndia is working towards becoming self-reliant in the space sector, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday. "The nation is proud of our space sector, Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla is back from the space station... in the days to come he will return to India," PM Modi said in his Independence Day address to the nation from the Red Fort.He said India is working on becoming self-reliant in the space sector as well, and is preparing for launch of Gaganyaan. Gaganyaan is India's flagship human spaceflight programme."We will make our own space station," he said.On Rashtriya Swayamsevak SanghPrime Minsiter Narendra Modi hailed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) for completing 100 years of service to the nation, describing it as the "biggest NGO in the world" and praising its century-long contribution to nation-building."Today, I would like to proudly mention that 100 years ago, an organisation was born - Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). 100 years of service to the nation is a proud, golden chapter. With the resolve of 'vyakti nirman se rashtra nirman', with the aim of welfare of Maa Bharati, swayamsevaks dedicated their lives to the welfare of our motherland...In a way, RSS is the biggest NGO of the world. It has a history of 100 years of dedication," PM Modi said.On 1975 EmergencyPM Modi said no generation in the country should forget how democracy was murdered, throttled, and backstabbed during the Emergency. "The Constitution was violated, we were cheated, we were stabbed in the back… India was turned into a prison, and the Emergency was imposed.""It has been 50 years of Emergency. No generation in the country should forget this sin of murdering the Constitution. They should not forget the sinners who murdered the Constitution. We should never forget how democracy was murdered, throttled, and backstabbed during the Emergency," he said.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
