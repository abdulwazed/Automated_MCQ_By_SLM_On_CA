The camp set up for pilgrims bore the brunt of the damage, leaving a mud-filled gorge where the langar stood. Floodwaters washed away several other structures, including a security post. Dozens of vehicles were damaged."Two CISF personnel were among the victims. Many of the pilgrims who died were having food in the langar when disaster struck," an official said.STUNNING Facts About Jammu & Kashmir's Chenab Rail Bridge You Need To Know | PM ModiChishoti is about 90km from Kishtwar and the last stop before pilgrims trek 8.5km to the ancient Machail Mata shrine.
