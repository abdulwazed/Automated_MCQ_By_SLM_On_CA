The rock band’s involvement is equally exciting, marking what could be a rare and emotional live set for the legendary rock band. If confirmed, their inclusion would give Lollapalooza India a unique blend of alternative, pop, rock, and metal energy.
 Linkin Park may co-headline Lollapalooza 2026 India (Credits: X/@linkinpark)Sharing alleged inside information about Billie and Linkin Park’s rumoured sets, one Reddit user wrote, “I can confirm the following: Billie Eilish (for headline slot), Linkin Park, M.I.A., Raja Kumari, Raftaar have signed contracts officially. They are negotiating with My Chemical Romance, but the band wants more of a payout, which would affect the festival budget. David Guetta is in talks, but nothing has been signed yet, and again, like MCR, it’s both a logistical and financial issue. A lot of people have been saying Bruno Mars, but my source has told me that it is false, and they have not reached out.”
