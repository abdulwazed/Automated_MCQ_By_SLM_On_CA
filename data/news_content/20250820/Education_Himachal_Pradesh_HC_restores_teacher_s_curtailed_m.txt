Justice Sandeep Sharma held that Kamini Sharma, a JBT, was entitled to her full 180-day leave sanctioned in 2021 despite her regularisation. The Court termed the recovery “wholly impermissible” and directed the government to release pending benefits within four weeks.  Shimla, Himachal Pradesh, India: The Himachal Pradesh High Court has come to the aid of a government school teacher whose maternity leave was curtailed midway after her regularisation, ruling that the state could not deny her the full benefit of leave already sanctioned.Justice Sandeep Sharma, in a detailed judgment delivered on August 11, 2025, allowed the petition filed by Kamini Sharma, a Junior Basic Teacher (JBT), and quashed the government’s orders dated December 13, 2021, December 23, 2021, and June 19, 2025.The Court noted that Sharma, who had given birth on August 21, 2021, was granted 180 days of maternity leave. However, after her services were regularised on October 21, 2021, she was compelled to rejoin duty the very next day by furnishing a medical fitness certificate.Subsequently, the education department cancelled her sanctioned leave, treated her absence as “extraordinary leave,” and even initiated recovery of salary.“The submission of Medical Fitness Certificate at the time of regularisation, in peculiar facts and circumstances as detailed hereinabove, could not have given any right to the respondents to curtail the maternity leave of the petitioner granted to her w.e.f. 21.8.2021, for a period of 180 days,” Justice Sharma observed.The judge also criticised the state’s conduct in proceeding with recovery despite an interim stay granted by the High Court on January 13, 2022. “Despite the said order, respondents have proceeded to order recovery from the petitioner vide order dated 19.6.2025, which is wholly impermissible,” the ruling said.Holding that the petitioner was entitled to complete her maternity leave until February 2022, the Court directed the government to release all due benefits within four weeks, failing which interest at 6% per annum would be payable from the date the amount fell due.
