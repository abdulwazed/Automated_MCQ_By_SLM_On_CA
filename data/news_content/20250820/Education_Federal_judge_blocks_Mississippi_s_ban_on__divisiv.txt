Federal judge blocks Mississippi’s ban on ‘divisive concepts’ in classrooms, fuelling national fight over DEI and academic freedom
A federal judge has blocked key parts of Mississippi's new law restricting DEI practices in public schools, citing First Amendment concerns. The injunction halts enforcement of sections banning 'divisive concepts' related to race, sex, and gender identity. While some provisions remain, the ruling allows educators to continue discussing contested issues, potentially influencing similar legal challenges nationwide.

The injunction halts enforcement of sections banning 'divisive concepts' related to race, sex, and gender identity. While some provisions remain, the ruling allows educators to continue discussing contested issues, potentially influencing similar legal challenges nationwide.  A federal judge has blocked major portions of Mississippi’s new law restricting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices in public schools, issuing a ruling that sharply questioned the statute’s constitutionality.US District Judge Henry Wingate granted a preliminary injunction on Monday, pausing enforcement of sections that ban schools from teaching so-called “divisive concepts” related to race, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or national origin. His order also blocks restrictions on DEI programs, courses, offices, and required diversity training, according to the Associated Press.Law still partially in effectThe injunction does not block other provisions of the law, including those prohibiting preferential treatment based on race, sex, or national origin and provisions penalising schools if staff or students refuse to adopt DEI concepts. The law, which took effect in April, threatens schools with the loss of state funding if they are found in violation.Court cites first amendment concernsIn his ruling, Wingate said the law “is unconstitutionally vague, fails to treat speech in a viewpoint-neutral manner, and carries with it serious risks of terrible consequences with respect to the chilling of expression and academic freedom,” according to the Associated Press.He also allowed the plaintiffs to add class-action claims, ensuring the injunction protects all teachers, professors, and students in the state.Teachers warn of chilling effectAt a hearing in early August, educators testified about the risks of teaching under the new law. Cliff Johnson, a professor at the University of Mississippi Law School, told the court that lessons on the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the Civil Rights Act, or even the murders of Emmett Till and Martin Luther King Jr. could be deemed impermissible.“I can teach my class as usual and run the serious risk of being disciplined, or I could abandon something that’s very important to me,” Johnson said, according to the Associated Press. “I feel a bit paralyzed.”State defends lawAttorneys for the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office argued the measure is consistent with government authority over school curriculum.“They are speaking for the government and the government has every right to tell them what they need to say on its behalf,” Assistant Attorney General Lisa Reppeto said, as reported by the Associated Press. She added that the statute’s penalties apply to schools, not to individual teachers or students.National implicationsThe Mississippi case is part of a broader wave of state efforts to limit how schools address race, gender, and sexuality. Legal experts say Wingate’s injunction could serve as a reference point for challenges to similar laws in other states.For now, the ruling allows Mississippi educators to continue discussing contested issues while the lawsuit proceeds — but the larger fight over DEI in schools is likely to intensify nationwide.Ready to navigate global policies?
