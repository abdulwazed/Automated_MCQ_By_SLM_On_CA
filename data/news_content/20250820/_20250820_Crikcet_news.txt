Pushing boundaries: How six-hitting changed T20 cricket; India’s surge in the big-hit race
T20 cricket has undergone a six-hitting revolution, transforming batting from risk-averse accumulation to power-driven aggression. India, once lagging behind, now match the world’s best with a six every 12 balls in 2024. With IPL and internationals fuelling the trend, six-hitting is now the currency of modern T20 cricket.

India, once lagging behind, now match the world’s best with a six every 12 balls in 2024. With IPL and internationals fuelling the trend, six-hitting is now the currency of modern T20 cricket. Abhishek Sharma  (TOI) NEW DELHI: Abhishek Sharma's father Rajkumar Sharma used to get really annoyed while coaching him at the Gandhi Stadium in Amritsar. Sharma says he once got so miffed that he didn’t allow him to bat for a couple of days as punishment. In Delhi, Sanjay Bharadwaj, who has coached the likes of Gautam Gambhir, Amit Mishra, Joginder Sharma, and Unmukt Chand, scolded his NextGen ward Priyansh Arya for always looking to hit glory shots.The two southpaws are still hitting sixes for fun, but their intent forced their respective coaches to change their approach. "Priyansh added that new armoury in my coaching craft. His style of batting forced me to adapt," Bharadwaj told TimesofIndia.com after Priyansh scored a stunning 39-ball century against Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in IPL 2025. Asia Cup 2025: India Squad Announced | Surya Named Captain, Gill Vice-CaptainHitting a six was once a rarity in cricket; coaches often reprimanded players because playing in the ‘V’ was considered the correct way of batting. Today, if you want to find a place in T20 sides as a batter, the ability to clear the boundary at will is non-negotiable.The T20 format has also evolved since its inception almost two decades ago. Earlier, most teams followed the ODI template in T20Is -- exploit the powerplay, save wickets in the middle, and then go all guns blazing in the last five or six overs.But over time, the notion that T20s are just a shorter version of ODIs has been firmly discarded. The format has built its own identity, where hitting sixes and scoring at a higher strike rate form the very foundation of batting.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!With more and more data available, teams realised that scoring quickly is more valuable than preserving wickets at the cost of a slower scoring rate. As a result, line-ups were stacked with power-hitters in the middle order, and players capable of clearing the ropes at will were valued more than accumulators.The six-hitting revolutionConsider this: In 2025, Australia struck 92 sixes in just 8 T20Is, averaging one every 9.5 balls - the second-best six-hitting rate in a calendar year, behind only West Indies’ 157 sixes in 13 matches at 9.2 balls per six in 2023.In 2012, T20 matches saw a six once every 27 deliveries. Since then, the frequency has risen every year, with sixes becoming increasingly common. West Indies were the first big T20 team to crack this code: sixes are the real currency in T20s, the most efficient way to maximise value from each of the 120 deliveries.PollWho do you think is the best power-hitter in T20 cricket today?Abhishek SharmaSuryakumar YadavOther notable playersIn 2016, the T20 World Cup champion West Indies men’s team struck sixes every 16.3 balls against the top seven teams, compared to once every 22.5 balls by other sides in the top eight against each other.In the eight matches they played during the 2015-16 season, the Caribbeans hit 68 sixes in 938 balls faced -- a six every 13.79 deliveries.Where do India’s batters stand? Year / TournamentMatches/InningsBalls FacedSixes HitBalls per SixIndia T20Is 201544641142.18India T20Is 2020101,1626418.15India T20Is 202426287723612.19IPL 20216013,95268720.30IPL 20257316,5141,29412.76 In 2015, Indian batters used to clear the boundary once every 42.18 balls in four T20s -- just 11 sixes from 464 deliveries.But five years later, in 2020, the frequency improved drastically. They struck 64 sixes in 1,162 balls across 10 innings -- one every 18.15 balls.In 2024, the year India dominated world cricket by winning 24 out of 26 matches culminating in their T20 World Cup triumph, their six-hitting touched a whole new level. Across 26 outings, India hit a six every 12.19 balls.IPL stats highlight the same trend. In 2021, out of 13,952 balls faced, batters hit 687 sixes -- one every 20.3 balls.By contrast, IPL 2025 saw 1,294 sixes from 16,514 balls -- a stunning frequency of one every 12.76 balls.The age of power-hittersThe evolution of T20 cricket has been fuelled by the six-hitting revolution. With the arrival of T20 specialists like Abhishek Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav, the art of clearing the ropes has reached unprecedented levels.The fact that 10 wickets are available to be spent in 120 balls changes the dynamics of risk and reward in batting.As a result, batters who are exceptionally good at “hitting” (maximising runs per delivery) have become more valuable than traditional accumulators.We are far from the time when T20s resembled a shortened version of ODIs. The direction is clear: sixes will keep coming more frequently, scores will rise higher, and bowlers will be pushed further to the margins of the format, whether the guardians of cricket like it or not.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Curiously, neither Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli appear in the latest ODI Rankings, issued by ICC - cricket's global body. In the latest update, August 19, neither of India's ex-captains find a spot in the top-10 rankings.In last week's update, Rohit was in the No. 2 spot with 756 points while Kohli stood in the fourth place with 736 points. Now, Shubman Gill is the leading batter in ODI rankings with 784 rating points and Shreyas Iyer in sixth on 704 points.

(Image: ICC)Neither Rohit or Kohli have played any cricket since IPL 2025 while their last appearance in India's colours came in March in the Champions Trophy final against New Zealand.Do players disappear from the ICC Rankings?Yes. As per ICC's rules on rankings, a player can be removed from the top-100 spots if they've not played a match within the qualifying period - 12-15 months for Tests and 9-12 months for ODIs and T20Is.Alternatively, a player can be removed from the rankings for good if they retire from a format or completely from international cricket. ICC, in its rulebook, explains that when MS Dhoni retired from Tests in 2014, he was removed from the Test rankings, but remained in the ODI rankings.This is why Kohli and Rohit are not presented in the latest Test and T20I rankings considering they've bowed out from both formats. Both retired from the shortest format after winning the 2024 T20 World Cup and from Tests in May this year.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

R Ashwin criticized the management's decision, fearing Samson's exclusion. Agarkar deferred to the team management for the final XI, acknowledging both Gill and Samson's recent form, leaving Samson's place uncertain despite his performances. Sanju Samson  Shubman Gill's selection as vice-captain for the upcoming Asia Cup in the UAE has sparked discussions about Sanju Samson's position in India's T20 team, despite his inclusion in the squad. The order in which selection committee chairman Ajit Agarkar announced the team has led to speculation about the final playing XI, with Gill possibly opening alongside Abhishek Sharma in India's first match against Oman.Chief selector Ajit Agarkar's announcement sequence, naming Gill and Jitesh Sharma before Samson and Rinku Singh, has fueled speculation about team composition. This has raised questions about Samson's role, despite his recent success as an opener.India Asia Cup squad: Why Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill are biggest talking pointsThe batting order appears likely to feature Tilak Varma, Suryakumar Yadav, Shivam Dube, Hardik Pandya, and Axar Patel from positions three to seven. This arrangement leaves limited opportunities for Samson at the top order.Former India spinner R Ashwin has made a scathing attack on Team India's management for picking Shubman Gill in the side."They are thinking of Shubman Gill as the leader for the future. Maybe he can be the all-format captain. But it is not necessary to have the same captain in all formats,” Ashwin said on his YouTube channel "Ash Ki Baat."PollWho do you think should open the batting for India against Oman?Shubman GillAbhishek SharmaBoth of them“What is sadder is that you have announced Gill as the vice-captain, so Sanju Samson's place is also under threat. Sanju is not going to play. Shubman Gill will play, and he will open the batting,” he added. Agarkar addressed the selection matter by deferring to the team management's decision. "The captain-coach will take the call on the best balance for the team. Once we get to Dubai, we will have a bit more clarity. With more options available now, Shubman has been in great form for the last few months. So has Sanju, so two good options, along with Abhishek," he stated.Samson, who captains Rajasthan Royals in the IPL, now faces an uncertain wait before the Asia Cup begins, despite his recent performances.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

His elevation signals a strategic move by the BCCI, potentially positioning him as a future all-format captain and a key figure in Indian cricket's brand identity. Shubman Gill (PTI Photo)  The selection of Shubman Gill as vice-captain of India’s T20 team for the Asia Cup is neither a surprise nor out of place.Barring the 2024 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), when he didn’t play his full quota of matches and finished 12th among the top-scorers that year, Gill has either topped the batting charts in the T20 league in the remaining seasons over the last five years or has managed to figure in the top five. In fact, when he top scored in the 2023 edition with 870 runs, it was only second to the most number of runs ever scored by a batter in the IPL — 973 runs in 2016 by Virat Kohli. It was Gill’s season with the bat and the rest were merely spectators soaking it all in.India Asia Cup squad: Why Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill are biggest talking pointsThe kind of aggression, consistency, approach and leadership that Gill has managed to show in the last few years of the IPL — the single-biggest platform that allows the selectors to do their T20 math before putting together a good team — didn’t leave Ajit Agarkar and his team with much of a choice but to bring him in. In a squad of 15, there was no chance of leaving the man aside.But then there are those who might ask, why the vice-captaincy? Has Gill done enough to slip into the leadership role in the shortest format, or is it a natural extension of the role he’s acquired in Test cricket, where BCCI’s possibly indicating that he could be India’s future all-format captain? Is Gill set to follow MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma and be the fourth in line very soon?23 years and 146 days23 years and 146 days - Shubman Gill's age when he scored his only T20I hundred, against New Zealand in Ahmedabad on February 1, 2023, making him the youngest Indian to score hundreds in all three formats in international cricket.Well, now that we’ve concluded that his selection in the team is by no degree an unwarranted one, let’s move on to understanding why his elevation as vice-captain in not unwarranted either.Shubman Gill in IPL over the yearsYearMatNoRunsHSAvgBFSR10050Career11817386612939.452787138.72426202515265093*50.00417155.8806202412142610438.73289147.4012202317289012959.33564157.803420221624839634.50365132.330420211704785728.11402118.9003202014144070*33.84373117.960320191442967632.88238124.3603201813520357*33.83139146.0401As much as the sport derives traction from the field, there’s a lot that happens off it also that keeps the Indian cricket ticking — revenues, broadcast, sponsorships, fan engagement and more. Every now and then, when broadcast rights or sponsorship slots go on sale, the cricket board ends up burning the midnight oil trying to figure the right value.In any kind of value creation, only brand and consistency matter. From the days of Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid, to 2007 when India struck the T20 goldmine and MS Dhoni emerged, to 2015 onwards, when Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma singlehandedly moved the brand needle in Indian cricket to the next level — there’s always been a face that Indian cricket could identify with.PollWill Shubman Gill become the future all-format captain of India?DefinitelyPossiblyUnlikelyIn 2024, ‘who next?’ was the question that began to pop up inside BCCI boardrooms. It is in search of this space that the cricket board began identifying Shubman Gill. It wasn’t some random out-of-the-blue selection hunch that elevated him to Test captaincy earlier this year. It isn’t some random selection hunch that’s elevated him to T20 captaincy either.Tuesday’s selection had a massive future connotation to it.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

You have to speak to the players, you have to go through the sadness."I just hope Shreyas Iyer and Yashasvi Jaiswal were given a call, and they were told the reasons behind not being picked.“Genuinely, I understand Shubman Gill's selection. He is also the vice-captain. He has scored a lot of runs for the Gujarat Titans in the IPL. He has the credentials to be picked in the T20I setup,” he added.Gill, 25, returned to the 15-man squad as deputy to skipper Suryakumar Yadav, thanks to the stellar role he played with the bat in the recent Test series against England.PollDo you agree with Ashwin's opinion on the exclusion of Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shreyas Iyer from the Asia Cup squad?Yes, it's unfairNo, the selections are justifiedNot sureI don't follow cricket closelyThe top-order batsman scored 754 runs as India's relatively young squad fought from behind to square the five-match series 2-2.The eight-nation Asia Cup will be the first major event in the build-up to next year's T20 World Cup in India in February and March.Gill, who was named Test skipper after the retirement of veterans Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli earlier this year, last played a T20 international in July 2024.“When you have Yashasvi Jaiswal as the third opener in the T20 World Cup 2024, to remove someone from the World Cup squad and bring in Shubman Gill... I mean, it's okay, I am happy for Shubman, but I'm very sad for both Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shreyas Iyer.

(AP Photo/Rajanish Kakade) Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh lambasted chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar for leaving out two “X-factor” players from India’s 15-member squad for the Asia Cup.“I feel that Siraj’s name should have been included as well. Siraj bowled very well in the recent series," Harbhajan said on his YouTube channel.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

The bowling unit would have seemed stronger. I feel that the ‘X-factor’ Siraj brings might be somewhat missed," he added.Another omission that surprised Harbhajan was the absence of Shreyas Iyer from the squad.“I had hoped he (Shreyas Iyer) would get a place in the team. He scored a lot of runs, played in the IPL final, and was in very good form."I thought his name could have been there. As for whose spot he would take, that is for the selectors to decide."When someone has to be included or left out, a spot is made. But I did not see Shreyas Iyer’s name there, which surprised me a little," he added.The Asia Cup will begin on September 9, with defending champions India set to face hosts United Arab Emirates a day later in Dubai in the eight-nation tournament.PollIs Shreyas Iyer's exclusion from the squad surprising?Absolutely surprisingNot surprising at allSomewhat surprisingI don't follow the team closelyIndia and arch-rivals Pakistan have been placed in Group A and will clash on September 14.Pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah has also made a comeback to the T20 squad after skipping two matches in England to manage his workload.Bumrah’s last T20 outing was India’s World Cup title win over South Africa at Barbados in June 2024.With Kohli and Rohit retiring from T20 internationals after that triumph, Bumrah will lead the pace attack alongside left-arm quick Arshdeep Singh and Harshit Rana.

Chopra believes this omission sends a negative signal regarding Iyer's T20I future. Shreyas Iyer (Image credit: ICC Photo) NEW DELHI: Former India opener Aakash Chopra has expressed surprise at Shreyas Iyer’s exclusion from the reserve players list for the upcoming Asia Cup, pointing out that it doesn’t send the right message regarding his T20I future.Iyer, who piled up 604 runs at a strike rate of 175 in IPL 2025 while leading Punjab Kings to the runners-up spot, had shown marked improvement against the short ball and dominated spinners throughout the tournament. Yet, he found no place in either the 15-member squad for the Asia Cup or the five-man reserves list.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!The omission had earlier baffled former India assistant coach Abhishek Nayar, and now Chopra has voiced similar concerns. "Shreyas' name is not even there in the five reserves, and that is surprising. It's understandable that you couldn't have him in the 15 as you can't play him in the XI, and you wanted lower-order batters as backup, where Shivam Dube is there, and Rinku Singh will be given another chance, which is absolutely par for the course."However, a place could have been created in the reserve players at least, where you have kept Dhruv Jurel, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Prasidh Krishna. Shreyas’ name could have been there, but you haven't kept it there either, and that doesn't send a great signal. The clarity in front of Shreyas' name is completely not there," Chopra said on his YouTube channel on Wednesday.At the same time, Chopra believes Iyer’s international future is far from over and that he still has a pathway to the 2026 Men’s T20 World Cup if he maintains strong performances in ODIs. For now, Iyer’s immediate focus will be on representing West Zone in the Duleep Trophy, which marks the start of the 2025/26 domestic season.India Asia Cup squad: Why Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill are biggest talking points"Shreyas Iyer not being there is a big story. What more will Shreyas Iyer have to do? What more can you do than what you have already done? You had a 600-plus run IPL season, took the team to the final, scored runs in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, played Ranji, and won the Champions Trophy. That's all you can do as a human being."This is the Asia Cup team. Don't attach the World Cup with it because there are 15 T20Is after this. The world changes in 15 T20Is. If he keeps scoring runs in ODIs, sooner or later, Shreyas Iyer will be part of the team. I have a strong feeling that Shreyas Iyer will be a part of India's T20 World Cup team," he added.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

India captain Shubman Gill speaks during a press conference at Edgbaston, Birmingham, England, Tuesday July 1, 2025. AP/PTI(AP07_01_2025_000278A) Legendary India cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has predicted that Shubman Gill might end up leading the team in T20Is as well, after the 25-year-old was elevated as the team’s vice-captain for the Asia Cup."Not surprising at all. He (Shubman Gill) scored over 750 runs just a couple of weeks ago," Gavaskar told India Today.India Asia Cup squad: Why Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill are biggest talking pointsGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"You cannot exclude a player in that kind of form. Also, he has done really well in the IPL, which concluded just before the tour to England."It's a very good inclusion. Giving him the vice-captaincy is also a way of telling him that in the future, he could be leading the T20 side. I think it’s a very, very good selection," he added."He was very impressive in England. To score 750-plus runs while leading the side for the first time shows how well he handled pressure."This vice-captaincy is a clear sign that he is going to be the captain of the Indian team as well. It's always good to have him take responsibility just a little bit earlier,” Gavaskar said.Gavaskar also refused to comment on Yashasvi Jaiswal's omission from the squad.PollHow do you rate Shubman Gill's performance in recent matches?OutstandingGoodAveragePoor"You can only pick XI in the match and you can only pick 15 in the squad. Somebody has to miss out; that's just how it is in Indian cricket," he said."No point in discussing whether A or B or C should've been there. This is now our team. We can all have our opinions before the selection committee picks the team, but once the team is picked, we should back it fully."We shouldn't be saying A should've been there or B should've been there. That only creates controversy, which the players don't need."Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Chief selector Ajit Agarkar acknowledged the difficulty of the decision, citing limited squad space. Shreyas Iyer (AP Photo) NEW DELHI: India’s cricket selectors sprung a surprise by leaving out Shreyas Iyer from both the 15-member Asia Cup squad and the five standby players, despite his strong showings in the Champions Trophy and IPL 2025. The announcement was made by BCCI chief selector Ajit Agarkar and T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav on Tuesday.Iyer enjoyed an excellent IPL season, guiding Punjab Kings to the final while amassing 604 runs in 17 matches at a strike rate of 175.07. He finished as the sixth-highest run-scorer of the tournament.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Former India assistant coach Abhishek Nayar voiced his disappointment at Iyer’s exclusion."I don't know, actually, I wanted to ask that question — aapke reserve players mein kaise nahi hai woh, if he is such a strong contender. Sometimes, you know, selection meetings can be quite interesting, and the discussions that happen in them can be very interesting," Nayar said on Star Sports.PollDo you agree with the exclusion of Shreyas Iyer from the Asia Cup squad?Yes, it was the right decision.No, he should have been included."But I can't fathom, and I don't understand, what reason can justify Shreyas Iyer not being part of that 20-member squad. I'm not even talking about the 15, I'm talking about the 20-member squad, which sends a message to Shreyas Iyer that he is not in the team's scheme of things. Because even if things don't work out, he is still not coming into the team. Either Riyan Parag is going to make the cut, or someone else is," he added."So, the big question here is that maybe they are not looking at him from a T20 point of view — or perhaps any other point of view. But I always say this that any selection after a while is, 'who you like a little more than the other'. In that regard, maybe Shreyas Iyer is not liked as much as someone else. Maybe."Chief selector Ajit Agarkar, meanwhile, addressed the calls regarding Iyer and Yashasvi Jaiswal."With regards to Shreyas, there's no fault of his — nor is it ours. It's just that we can only pick 15, and at the moment, he might have to wait for his chance," Agarkar explained."With regards to Yashasvi Jaiswal, it's just unfortunate again. Abhishek Sharma, with what he has done over the last few months — or a year or so that he has been with the team — plus the fact that he can bowl a little, gives us an option if required by the captain. One of these guys was always going to miss out. It's just unfortunate that Yashasvi might have to wait for his chance."Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"I think whatever I did as a cricketer, off the field, on the field, credit goes to him. He used to give us a lot of confidence. He led from the front. He had a belief in his own ability. He was a hardworking cricketer," Akram said on Stick to Cricket.While many considered Imran a naturally gifted player, Akram stressed that his success was built on relentless effort. "People used to say I'm very naturally talented. Skipper wasn't talented. He worked hard. Remember he changed his bowling action. From 76, exactly. Changing even a little bit of action can take months, it might not happen. But he did change his action. He was so determined," Akram said.Akram emphasised that Imran’s determination and willingness to reinvent himself set an example for the entire team. His hard work, according to Akram, created a culture where no one could afford to be complacent. "I mean he was the best captain I played under. He used to give confidence to every one of us," Akram noted.PollWho do you believe is the greatest cricket captain in history?Imran KhanKapil DevSteve WaughClive LloydAt the same time, Imran was known to be tough on his players when required. Akram explained that the former skipper demanded full commitment on the field. "At times he used to shout at us because if you were lazy, fair enough. He was tough, but he was tough on the field. You give your 100%. If you don’t do well, he was okay with it," he said.However, Imran could not tolerate players who tried to shield themselves in pressure situations. "If you're trying to save yourself and say okay, it's a pressure situation, I’ll just take a back seat — he used to judge. He knew this particular player is just saving himself. So that used to annoy him a lot," Akram revealed.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

While Agarkar emphasizes the captain and coach will decide the final XI, Suryakumar Yadav praised Jitesh Sharma's growth, potentially favoring him. Samson's place in the playing XI remains uncertain despite his squad inclusion, creating a nervous wait. Sanju Samson (X) Former India batter Aakash Chopra believes Shubman Gill’s return to the side has all but ended Sanju Samson’s chances of finding a place in the playing XI for the Asia Cup in the UAE. “India seems to be moving in the direction of an all-format captain. With Shubman Gill’s return, Sanju Samson’s fate has more or less been sealed. He will not feature in the playing XI now. You will not drop Tilak Varma or Hardik Pandya, which means Samson sits out and Jitesh Sharma will likely get the nod again. One thing is very clear from this selection, the batting slots have been prioritised over personalities. With Gill coming in as vice-captain, he will definitely play and open the batting. This essentially pushes Sanju Samson out of the XI,” Chopra said on JioHotstar.India Asia Cup squad press conference: What Ajit Agarkar, Surya said on shocking callsGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! The announcement of Gill as vice-captain has once again placed a question mark over Samson’s future in T20 internationals. Samson has been included in the squad, but Gill’s return has raised doubts about whether the Kerala batter will make the playing XI. The speculation has grown stronger after chief selector Ajit Agarkar read out the names in a particular order. Gill and Jitesh Sharma were mentioned first, while Samson and Rinku Singh were named towards the end. Many see this as an indication that Gill will open alongside Abhishek Sharma, while Jitesh may take the gloves and bat in the finisher’s role. With Tilak Varma, Suryakumar Yadav, Shivam Dube, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel expected to fill the middle-order positions, Samson’s opportunities look limited. Jitesh could also be preferred over Rinku Singh as a late-order pinch-hitter. Agarkar, however, played down the debate, saying the final XI would be decided by the captain and coach once the team reaches Dubai. “The captain-coach will take the call on the best balance for the team. Once we get to Dubai, we will have a bit more clarity. With more options available now, Shubman has been in great form for the last few months. So has Sanju, so two good options, along with Abhishek,” Agarkar said.PollWhich player seems most likely to take the gloves in the Asia Cup?Sanju SamsonJitesh Sharma Skipper Suryakumar Yadav added weight to Jitesh Sharma’s case, praising his transformation as a batter over the past year. “Post the last T20 World Cup, we spoke a lot on how to go about it. We said let’s not think of milestones ahead, follow your journey. He has been a completely different cricketer post that. The way he performed in the IPL and domestic tournaments, he has earned his spot again,” Surya said. The captain also defended the selection of pacer Harshit Rana, highlighting his consistency. “He has played really well in the IPL. In Pune, he came in as a concussion replacement and was Man of the Match in the last game he played for India. We back his skills, we know he can deliver,” Surya added. With both the chief selector and captain offering different signals, Samson faces another nervous wait. For now, his inclusion in the squad is not under question, but his place in the XI looks increasingly uncertain.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

The final decision on the wicketkeeper will depend on the team's batting strategy. Rishabh Pant of India (Photo by Gareth Copley/Getty Images) India will head into the Asia Cup 2025 without Rishabh Pant, who has been sidelined with a fractured foot. The wicketkeeper-batsman picked up the injury on the opening day of the fourth Test against England and was forced to return home, missing the fifth Test as well. Pant is now confirmed to miss both the Asia Cup and the upcoming home Test series against West Indies. Even before his injury, Pant was not in India’s immediate T20 plans. Sanju Samson has been the first-choice wicketkeeper in the format, with Pant last featuring in a T20 international against Sri Lanka in July 2024 at Pallekele. His absence has only further cemented Samson’s role behind the stumps, while Jitesh Sharma has been drafted in as the second wicketkeeping option.India Asia Cup squad press conference: What Ajit Agarkar, Surya said on shocking callsGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

He endured a forgettable IPL 2025 campaign, scoring just 269 runs at an average of 24.45 and a strike rate of 133.17.

While Samson has consistently opened with Abhishek Sharma for India, the return of vice-captain Shubman Gill could push him down the order. If that happens, Jitesh’s power-hitting skills in the middle and lower order could come into play. The final call on who takes the gloves will depend on how the management plans its batting combinations.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Suryakumar continues as captain, with Shubman Gill promoted to vice-captain. The squad retains a strong core from the England series: Abhishek, Tilak, Hardik, Dube, Axar, Rinku, Samson, and Varun are all present. However, there are some notable changes. Veteran pacer Mohammed Shami, who starred against England, is missing. Instead, Jasprit Bumrah returns to the T20I setup after workload management kept him out for much of the England tour. Young quick Harshit Rana has also been drafted in, offering fresh pace options alongside Arshdeep Singh.On the spin front, Kuldeep Yadav comes in, strengthening India’s variety, while Bishnoi drops out. The wicketkeeping department sees Samson retained, but Jitesh Sharma is added as a second option, giving the side more flexibility in finishing roles. Shubman Gill, absent from the last T20I, not only returns but takes up leadership responsibility, signalling the selectors’ long-term trust in him. The biggest talking points are the omissions of Shreyas Iyer and Yashasvi Jaiswal, both overlooked despite good domestic and IPL form. Chief selector Ajit Agarkar explained that competition for places, particularly in the middle order, forced tough calls.India squad for Asia Cup 2025: Surya Kumar Yadav (c), Shubman Gill (vc), Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Jitesh Sharma (WK), Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, Varun Chakaravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Sanju Samson (wk), Harshit Rana, Rinku Singh.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
