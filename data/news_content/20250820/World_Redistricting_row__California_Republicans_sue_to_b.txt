File photo: California Governor Gavin Newsom (Picture credit: AP) California Republicans have asked the state Supreme Court to block Governor Gavin Newsom’s redistricting plan, arguing Democrats are rushing legislation that could add five new Democratic congressional seats to counter Republican gains in Texas.The emergency petition, filed Monday by four Republican lawmakers, claims the plan violates the state constitution’s 30-day public review rule for new legislation. “Instead of a months-long transparent and participatory process overseen by an independent citizens redistricting commission … the public would be presented with an up-or-down vote on maps unilaterally prepared in secret by the Legislature,” the lawsuit said, according to The New York Times.Republicans want the court to pause the process until at least September 18 unless each legislative chamber secures a three-fourths vote to move faster, according to news agency Reuters. They also requested the court either rule on the merits by Wednesday or halt the process while the case is under review.Democratic leaders, who hold supermajorities in Sacramento, intend to pass three bills under what they have called the “Election Rigging Response Act” on Thursday to meet Newsom’s deadline for a November 4 special election. A spokesperson for the governor dismissed the challenge, saying: “Republicans are filing a deeply unserious (and truly laughable) lawsuit to stop Americans from voting? We’re neither surprised, nor worried,” as per Axios.The push is part of a broader national battle sparked when US President Donald Trump urged Texas Republicans to redraw maps mid-decade to secure five more GOP seats. Democrats in California are now pursuing a “tit-for-tat” strategy, according to Reuters, to offset Texas and preserve House control. Republicans currently hold a narrow 219-212 majority in the chamber.Critics say the move undermines California’s independent redistricting commission, created by voters in 2008 to ensure transparency. Democrats argue it is a temporary emergency measure to counter “extreme” gerrymandering efforts elsewhere.The lawsuit also highlights technical constitutional questions, including whether the 30-day clock begins when a bill number is assigned or only after the full text is introduced. California law also requires the final text of bills to be available 72 hours before any vote, a rule Democrats say they are observing with Thursday’s planned passage, The New York Times reported.The National Republican Congressional Committee has already signalled plans for further litigation.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
