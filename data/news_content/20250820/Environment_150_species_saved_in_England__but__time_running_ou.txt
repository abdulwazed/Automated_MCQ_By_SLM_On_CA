But time is running out fast," he added. Representative image LONDON: A multi-million pound conservation programme in England helped save 150 struggling species but "time is running out" to halt the decline, the head of Natural England, which led the initiative, said Wednesday.The public body, responsible for protecting and enhancing England's natural environment, invested a £13 million ($17.6 million) grant in efforts to support animal and plant species such as water vole, oystercatcher, lady's slipper orchid, the hazel dormouse and Atlantic salmon. "From the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall to Cumbria and Northumberland, 63 different projects involving 78 partners have transformed landscapes and supported the recovery of 150 species, many of which were on the brink of national extinction, through research, captive breeding, habitat creation, and conservation translocations," the body said in a statement released Wednesday.More than 15,000 individual animals and plants were translocated to expand species territories under the projects, which ran from August 2023 to March 2025. Notable successes include the reintroduction of black grouse to the North Yorkshire Moors, northern England, and the return of the large marsh grasshopper to the Norfolk Broads in east England after an 85-year absence. Despite the achievements, the chair of Natural England Tony Juniper warned more needed to be done. "A rising number of nature recovery projects, both large and small, are making a huge difference up and down the country," he said in the press release."We know we can turn round species decline and improve ecosystems with the right targeted actions, the drive and the funding. But time is running out fast," he added.Juniper called for more projects, more volunteers and more investment, particularly from the private sector.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous10 creatures that can live inside volcanic zonesLifestyleYou’re probably a hater if you’re one of these zodiac signsastrologyHow to set up a planted aquarium at home and the types of fish to keep: 10-step guideLifestyle'Coolie': Rajinikanth to SoubinShahir'spay revealed!EntertainmentAlia Bhatt’s hairstylist warns against straightening damp hair: Know why we agree with himLifestyleZodiac signs who are known for their simplicityastrologyDO NOT ignore these warning signs of a heart attackLifestyleDipika Kakar’s top 10 gorgeous ethnic looks for festive seasontvJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than Wordstv Next123 Photostories  Janmashtami 2025: 5 savoury snacks perfect for fasting and feasting5 veggies to pair with Rajma (kidney beans) to boost its fiber contentThese foods can reduce the cooking time of meat5 last-minute weekend trips from Delhi you can plan right now!From Varsha to Divinesh: A look at the winners of Sa Re Ga Ma Pa TamilIndependence Day: Unveiling 10 rare pictures from India’s struggle for freedom7 foods to strictly avoid in monsoon seasonGuard deployed, protests erupt: National Guard steps up presence in Washington; 10 things to knowMovies that made us question everything we thought we knewSara Tendulkar’s protein drinks: How to make them and their benefits123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillVanessa BryantDwyane WadeKyrie lrvingNHL Trade RumorsRaj KundraWhy Roblox Get Banned in QatarMega Slowbro solo in Pokemon GOJohnny SomalisBrock Lesnar Net WorthTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteAir Arabia reports AED 415 million net profit in Q2 2025 despite regional disruptionsUAE heatwave alert: Temperatures to soar to 46°C in Dubai and Abu DhabiUAE: Etihad hits record 20.3 million passengers in 12 months for the first timeUkraine-Russia conflict: Zelenskyy arrives in London, meets UK PM Starmer ahead of Trump-Putin's Alaska summitWhat is David G.
