He highlights the couple's request for authentic, unretouched images and the overwhelming reach of his work, even to unexpected corners of India. While unfazed by Virat, Radhik admits being star-struck photographing Priyanka Chopra's wedding to Nick Jonas.  Celebrity photographer Joseph Radhik, who captured the intimate and dreamy wedding of Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma in Tuscany in 2017, has opened up about his experience, capturing priceless moments from the couple's special day. Shooting the Virushka weddingThe celebrity photographer, who appeared on a news channel, spilled the beans about the hush-hush wedding and revealed why it still is his favourite celebrity wedding to date. Calling it one of the most defining moments of his career, Radhik revealed to News18, "When I shot Virat-Anushka's wedding in 2017, it was extremely special for me. It is a photographer's dream for their work to be seen by a few million people. To think that my work went so viral in that moment, and to think that so many people saw it across the world... that was surreal.”Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma’s Secret London Date Caught on CameraPhotos going viralThe photographer also recalled how overwhelming it was to see his images reach unexpected corners of India. While admitting other photographers often argue about the copyright of their images, he said, "But I was on the other end, super happy, grinning to see my images on places like a barber shop in Udaipur, on a pathaka dabba, or somewhere on the back of an auto. That entire year after Virat and Anushka's wedding was sublime.”Favourite photoWhen asked to pick his favourite photo from the entire wedding album, he revealed that Virat kissing Anushka on her forehead during the wedding celebrations was his favourite. Anushka's brief before the weddingWhen asked about the brief given to him, Radhik shared that Anushka had only one request, which was - to keep the images real. He shared with the portal, “Their input primarily was that I should be there to document the wedding, so that the world can see the kind of wedding they had, without any input from me or them during those moments."The photographer, who has been the man behind some of the biggest celeb weddings to date, including Vicky Kaushal and Katrina Kaif to Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas, he shared, "The brides mostly gave me the brief." He went on to add that when it came to Virat and Anushka's wedding, the photos were not even retouched in any way. He pointed out, "You can even see the crow's feet near their eyes. None of these images were retouched. It was just me editing and sharing them within minutes."On being star-struckDespite being a lifelong cricket fan, Radhik said he did not feel star-struck photographing the star couple. He noted, "Those two were just so happy, there was no star presence around them. I was just grinning from left to right that day."However, he admitted that one celebrity wedding did leave him awe-struck was that of Priyanka Chopra’s grand wedding to Nick Jonas. “I’ve always been a Desi Girl fan. When she was getting ready in her red lehenga, Mickey Contractor doing her makeup, I just thought, ‘Oh my God, I’m photographing Priyanka Chopra’s wedding,’” he confessed.Viral and Anushka were recently in the news when the two were spotted enjoying a quiet day out and about the streets of London. The couple was seen rocking a casual look as they stepped out and even spent a while chatting with locals around a street corner. According to reports they have decided to shift base to the UK to raise their two children Vamika and Akaay, away from the spotlight."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
