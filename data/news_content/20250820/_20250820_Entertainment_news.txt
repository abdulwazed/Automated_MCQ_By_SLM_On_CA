His pan-Indian appeal and event-style projects set him apart, establishing a new benchmark for box office success that other South Indian superstars are striving to achieve. Prabhas has solidified his position as the 'Day 1 King' in Indian cinema, consistently delivering massive opening day numbers with films like *Saaho*, *Adipurush*, *Salaar*, and *Kalki 2898 AD*, even when reviews are mixed. His pan-Indian appeal and event-style projects set him apart, establishing a new benchmark for box office success that other South Indian superstars are striving to achieve. In the ever-evolving landscape of Indian cinema, where the box office is increasingly dominated by pan-India spectacles, one actor has carved a space unlike any other: Prabhas. Since the historic success of Baahubali 2: The Conclusion in 2017, Prabhas has become the face of opening day euphoria. No matter the genre, no matter the competition, his films have consistently stormed into theatres with earth-shattering day-one numbers, something even other superstars, despite their stature and talent, have struggled to replicate.And post Baahubali 2, the actor has not done even one sequel thereby taking out the last film’s buzz into account.Baahubali 2 didn’t just change Prabhas’s career; it changed the very grammar of Indian box office reporting. The SS Rajamouli-directed epic opened to record numbers, rewriting the rules of how big a film could go. It was the first film to cross the Rs 1000 crore mark. It also cemented Prabhas as the first genuine pan-India superstar from the South, with fan bases cutting across linguistic and geographical boundaries. Suddenly, Day 1 numbers became the currency of stardom, and every new big-ticket release was compared to the Baahubali phenomenon.The Day 1 StreakWhat makes Prabhas unique is his ability to sustain the “event film” aura beyond Baahubali. While other actors from the South have occasionally breached big numbers, Prabhas has done so consistently, with almost every outing (barring Radhe Shyam).Saaho: Despite mixed reviews and criticism of its screenplay, Saaho stormed into theatres with a Rs 89 crore opening across languages. The film’s scale, action set pieces, and Prabhas’s aura carried it to one of the biggest first days for an Indian film at the time.The film earned over Rs 300 crore at the box office. Radhe Shyam: A rare miss, this romantic drama marked a departure from Prabhas’s mass-action image. With a softer genre and limited appeal in the Hindi belt, the film managed Rs 43.1 crore on opening day—a number still respectable, but far from the benchmark audiences expected.The film folded up at Rs 104 crore.Adipurush: In spite of polarizing reactions and social media criticism, Om Raut’s mythological epic earned a massive Rs 86.75 crore on its opening day. Once again, Prabhas’s star power drove audiences into theatres, underlining his consistent box office draw, the film went on to collect Rs 288.15 crore.Salaar: Part 1 - Ceasefire: Directed by Prashanth Neel of KGF fame, Salaar capitalized on high-octane action and Prabhas’s rugged persona, delivering a Rs 90.7 crore Day 1. The film went on to cement itself as one of the top grossers of the year with Rs 406 crore collection.Kalki 2898 AD : India’s most ambitious sci-fi spectacle lived up to its billing, scoring a record Rs 95.3 crore opening day. The film not only proved Prabhas’s ability to lead big-ticket projects but also showed how his films transcend regional limitations to appeal to audiences across India. The film went on to become one the biggest hits of Indian Cinema with Rs 646 crore collection. This consistent streak—where four out of his last five major films opened above Rs 85 crore is unparalleled in Indian cinema.The Outlier: Radhe ShyamIt’s worth noting that Radhe Shyam’s comparatively lower opening was not due to waning star power but because of a genre mismatch. Prabhas’s fanbase, built on high-octane action spectacles and mythological grandeur, found it difficult to reconcile with a European-set romantic tragedy. Even then, Rs 43.1 crore was no small feat, especially for a film that lacked the mass pull of an action entertainer.Prabhas’s trajectory has had ripple effects across the Indian film industry. Seeing his success, other South Indian superstars began positioning themselves as pan-India actors, dubbing their films in Hindi and expanding release footprints. However, not everyone has managed to match his consistency.Ram Charan: After the massive success of RRR which earned Rs 133 crore on day 1 , his standalone project Game Changer opened to Rs 51 crore solid, but nowhere near Prabhas’s standard as the film fizzled out within the first week.Jr NTR: His post-RRR collection of Rs 133 crore his film Devara debuted at Rs 82.5 crore, just shy of the Rs 85 crore mark, but his next outing War 2 dropped to Rs 52 crore.Allu Arjun: The one exception is Pushpa 2, which exploded with a staggering Rs 164.25 crore Day 1, thanks largely to the carryover craze from Pushpa: The Rise. However, this is more the story of a sequel with unprecedented Hindi market penetration than a sustainable trend across multiple films.This contrast makes Prabhas stand out: his Day 1 numbers are not tied to sequels or Rajamouli but to his own brand value.Why Prabhas WorksSeveral factors explain why Prabhas continues to be the “Day 1 King”:Pan-India Appeal: Unlike most South stars who still have their strongest pull in specific states, Prabhas enjoys near-equal fanbases across Telugu, Tamil, and Hindi markets. His films are marketed simultaneously as national events.Event-Style Projects: Be it Saaho, Salaar, or Kalki 2898 AD, his projects are mounted on massive budgets with VFX, scale, and action that demand big-screen viewing. Audiences know a Prabhas release will be an event, not just a film.With his next Raja Saab he is once again experimenting with horror-comedy. Mystique of Baahubali: The afterglow of Baahubali 2 still lingers. For many audiences, Prabhas is etched as the face of India’s greatest blockbuster, giving him a credibility few can replicate.Global Strategy: Prabhas’s films are planned with worldwide releases in mind, ensuring massive screen counts across India and overseas, which naturally boost Day 1 numbers.The Day 1 figure has now become an industry-wide obsession, and much of that credit (or blame) goes to Prabhas. His consistency has raised expectations for every South Indian superstar attempting pan-India cinema. Audiences and trade analysts now measure stardom not only by lifetime collections but also by the ability to open big on the very first day.In the crowded and competitive world of Indian cinema, Prabhas stands tall as the only actor who has made Rs 85 crore+ Day 1 openings his trademark. From Saaho to Salaar, from Adipurush to Kalki 2898 AD, he has proven time and again that his name alone can drive audiences to theatres in record numbers.While others may score occasionally, consistency is the true marker of stardom. And in that respect, Prabhas is unrivalled—not just in the South, but across India."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorJigar ShahWith nearly 14 years of experience as an entertainment journalist, I have established my credibility in the industry.

Sreeraman emphasized Mammootty's resilience and unwavering spirit throughout the process. Their conversations spanned various topics, showcasing Mammootty's enduring curiosity and passion for life, including cameras and farming, signaling a strong recovery. (Picture Courtesy: Facebook) Veteran actor and writer V.K. Sreeraman has now opened up about further updates regarding the legendary actor Mammootty's health and also glimpses into their deep bond.Mammootty says -'Food had no taste, smell was gone'Sreeraman revealed to Manorama News that Mammootty himself had spoken about the struggles he faced in the early stages of treatment. “During the early stages of treatment, he said food had no taste and he had lost his sense of smell. Now all that has changed. He’ll soon return to the crowd. Mammootty himself called and said he is completely cured,” he said.Despite the difficult phase, Sreeraman noted that Mammootty never allowed his illness to define him. “There’s never been any sign of weakness in his voice, never like a patient’s. The same strength, the same energy, as always,” he recalled.Mammootty walks down memory lane as he revisits his college!'Mammootty calls me regularly — sometimes once a week'The two friends spoke frequently, often about anything other than health. “He calls me regularly — sometimes once a week. At first, when he used to call, he would mention that food had no taste, or that it was hard to walk. But he never gave much importance to those issues. Mostly, our conversations were about other things — sometimes politics, sometimes farming, sometimes random topics,” Sreeraman shared.Mammootty, he added, often challenged his opinions, jokingly calling him out when he tried to avoid giving a clear answer. “If I run out of things to say, he jokes, ‘So you’re pretending to be an intellectual without any real knowledge?’” Sreeraman said with a smile.'yesterday, he spent a long time explaining different cameras to me'Even during illness, Mammootty’s curiosity and passion for life remained unchanged. “Yesterday, he spent a long time explaining different cameras to me — like the Fuji, and also the handmade camera carried to the moon by the first astronauts,” Sreeraman said, describing the megastar’s childlike enthusiasm.He added that Mammootty has also been talking about farming and trees he has planted at his home. “I was always certain he would come back, and now I’m even more sure,” Sreeraman said, assuring fans that their beloved actor is well on the road to recovery."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorEntertainment Deskमटा मनोरंजन डेस्क ही मराठी आणि हिंदी चित्रपट, ओटीटी, संगीत, मराठी टीव्ही कार्यक्रम, वेब सिरीज आणि सेलिब्रिटी बातम्यांवर केंद्रित एक उत्साही टीम आहे. चित्रपट समीक्षण, कलाकारांच्या मुलाखती, ट्रेलर विश्लेषण, गॉसिप्स आणि सोशल मीडिया ट्रेंड्सवरील विश्वासार्ह आणि मनोरंजक माहिती आम्ही सर्जनशील शैलीत वाचकांपर्यंत पोहोचवितो. माहिती आणि मनोरंजन यांचा समतोल राखणे हे आमचे वैशिष्ट्य आहे.Read MoreEnd of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous10 animals on the planet known for their loudnessLifestyleAnushka-Virat, Ranveer-Deepika to Sidharth-Kiara: Most memorable celebrity pregnancy announcements of all timeEntertainmentHow to use Kumkumadi Tailam to get that everlasting glow on the faceLifestyle9 simple tips to lower blood pressure naturallyLifestyleIn pics: Adorable looks of Chandhini PrakashtvZodiac signs that feel loneliness the mostastrologyLife lessons to learn from Samantha Ruth PrabhuEntertainmentNayanthara’s transformation: Glowing brighter with timeEntertainmentTop 5 zodiac signs who are truly spiritual soulsastrologyVerdict of Rajinikanth's last 10 films before 'Coolie'Entertainment Next123 Photostories  From recalling how Kapil Sharma helped her when she was ‘inappropriately touched’ to dealing with body shaming comments: Bharti Singh makes shocking revelations5 South Indian dishes that celebrate coconut in every biteCan drinking Orange Clove Ginger tea heal severe sore throatFrom Theft Allegations to Ganja Case Summons: Times when Bigg Boss Malayalam 6 winner Jinto courted controversy409 mm in 36 hours: Relentless rain cripples Mumbai; roads, rail and air traffic hitFrom Vanitha Vijayakumar to Priyanka Deshpande: A look at the winners of Cooku With ComaliDiabetes: 6 unusual symptoms you’d never guess are linked to high blood sugar (detecting them early can help manage diabetes naturally)Bollywood's cutest child actors: From Ahsaas Channa to Darsheel Safarey, the actors who stole our hearts from a young age11 timeless sweets from different states of IndiaTimes when Shweta Tiwari’s proved she’s aging in reverse123Top TrendingFree Doctor Strange Skin in Marvel RivalsJean PormanoveOnline Gaming BillDennis RodmanTyson BagentLeon Draisaitl wifeAndy RoddickTom BradyNHL Trade NewsTaylor SwiftTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website“The most beautiful bride’: Leon Draisaitl’s wife Celeste Desjardins reacts to Warren Foegele and Alexandra Servos’ Toronto weddingEarth split captured on camera for the first time: Why it is a breakthrough for earthquake science‘If Indian goods cannot go to US, they can head to…’: Russia slams ‘unjustified’ Trump sanctions on oil; Putin to meet PM Modi in India this year'Tomorrow not promised': YouTubers were enjoying a meal when SUV smashed through glass and into them - watch viral video'Gut-wrenching': Kristi Noem reacts to Indian truck driver Harjinder Singh killing 3 in Florida in accident, blames Newsom'Gave some papers, then hit her': Delhi CM Rekha Gupta 'attacked' during 'Jan Sunwai'; man arrestedAsia Cup 2025: Complete squads of all teams, fixtures'How much have they paid you?': US lawmaker slammed for joining India Fest, he pushes backAsia Cup | 'Shreyas Iyer is not liked as much as ...

On his birth anniversary, let’s look back at some of his funniest and most unforgettable moments from ‘Friends’ that continue to bring smiles to millions of fans around the world.2/6​Trapped in the ATM vestibule with Jill GoodacreOne of the earliest classic Chandler moments comes when he gets stuck in an ATM vestibule during a city blackout. To make things even more awkward, he is trapped with Victoria’s Secret model Jill Goodacre and Chandler’s nervousness takes over, and we hear his hilarious inner monologue as he struggles to say something “cool” but ends up embarrassing himself instead. His physical comedy shines when he tries to act normal while choking on chewing gum.3/6​"I am moving to yemen!” to escape JaniceChandler’s on-and-off relationship with Janice gave the show some of its funniest storylines. In one episode, he is so desperate to avoid breaking up with her that he blurts out he is moving to Yemen. Janice insists on seeing him off, and Chandler actually buys a ticket to Yemen just to keep the lie going and watching him at the airport, uncomfortably saying goodbye while realizing he might actually have to board the plane, is peak Chandler also his exaggerated expressions and sarcastic remarks make the scene unforgettable.4/6​The “Pivot!” couch disasterOne of the most iconic Friends moments comes when Ross buys a couch and asks Chandler and Rachel to help him move it upstairs. The stairway is too narrow, and Ross keeps screaming “Pivot! Pivot!” While Chandler grows more frustrated and his sarcastic delivery of “Shut up, shut up, shut uuuup!” is one of the funniest lines in the entire series also Chandler’s mixture of exhaustion and wit is what makes the scene so hilarious.5/6​Eating cheesecake off the floorChandler and Rachel accidentally find a cheesecake that doesn’t belong to them, but it tastes so good they can’t resist. At first, they sneak bites, then they argue over it, and eventually, the cheesecake falls on the floor. Instead of stopping, both Chandler and Rachel sit down and eat it off the floor with forks. The sight of Chandler fully enjoying food in such an absurd situation is hilarious.6/6​The bunny costume fiascoIn the Halloween episode, Chandler shows up dressed as a giant pink bunny because Monica wanted him to wear it and his embarrassment is clear from the moment he walks in, and his sarcastic complaints make the costume even funnier. When Joey arrives dressed as Chandler, the situation gets even more hilarious and also Chandler, who always prided himself on being sarcastic and smart, is forced into looking completely ridiculous.Follow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousNayanthara’s transformation: Glowing brighter with timeindiaTop 5 zodiac signs who are truly spiritual soulsindia9 vegetarian-friendly

It earned a lot of money on the first day in Tamil Nadu. The film made Rs 216 crore in India in just six days. Coolie is now Rajinikanth's third-biggest movie in India.

It earned a lot of money on the first day in Tamil Nadu. The film made Rs 216 crore in India in just six days. Coolie is now Rajinikanth's third-biggest movie in India. Only 2.0 and Jailer earned more. Rajinikanth is still a big star even with younger actors coming up.  Rajinikanth has once again proven why he remains the undisputed superstar of Indian cinema. His latest release, Coolie directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj, has stormed the box office and officially emerged as the megastar’s third biggest hit in India, standing tall behind 2.0 (2018) and Jailer (2023).Released with massive anticipation, Coolie opened to a thunderous Rs 65 crore Day 1, the highest-ever for Rajinikanth in Tamil Nadu. The film’s first weekend collections were rock solid, with Rs 54.75 crore on Friday, Rs 39.5 crore on Saturday, and Rs 35.25 crore on Sunday, taking the opening four-day total to Rs 194.5 crore. Despite the usual weekday drop, the film still managed to earn Rs 12 crore on Monday and an estimated Rs 9.5 crore on Tuesday, pushing its six-day India total to Rs 216 crore.‘Coolie’ release sparks madness: Rajinikanth fans dance and flood theatres in Tamil NaduWhen compared to Rajinikanth’s previous blockbusters, Coolie is now firmly positioned as his third-biggest grosser in India. 2.0, directed by Shankar, remains on top with a mammoth Rs 407.05 crore India net, followed by Nelson’s Jailer, which amassed Rs 348.55 crore during its run. Coolie though has been losing audience with each passing day but it is still running strong with the current trend the film is eyeing a lifetime total in the Rs 275-300 crore range if the films gets a huge push in the coming weekend.PollIs 'Coolie' likely to reach a lifetime total of Rs 275-300 crore?Yes, it has the potential.No, it's losing audience.The film’s success highlights Rajinikanth’s enduring box office power even in an era dominated by younger stars and pan-India spectacles. Unlike 2.0, which was mounted as a high-budget sci-fi extravaganza with a wider Hindi market appeal, and Jailer, which benefitted from tremendous word-of-mouth, Coolie is a more mass-oriented Rajinikanth vehicle. Yet, its ability to pull in over Rs 200 crore within a week underscores the superstar’s unshakable connect with audiences.For context, recent South biggies from contemporaries haven’t delivered with the same consistency. While Jailer and Pushpa 2 broke records, many other star vehicles have seen steep drops post-opening. In contrast, Rajinikanth’s films have continued to command historic openings and sustained runs, proving his unparalleled stature across decades.With Coolie officially becoming his third highest-grossing film in India, Rajinikanth now holds the rare distinction of delivering three of Tamil cinema’s all-time biggest blockbusters in different genres and phases of his career. At 74, the Thalaivar shows no signs of slowing down, reminding the industry why he remains its most bankable icon. His next is going to be Jailer 2 with Nelson with talks already happening about collaborating with Lokesh again for a film with Kamal Haasan.

Deepika Padukone and Yuvraj Singh's relationship was short-lived. Sushmita Sen denied wedding rumours with Wasim Akram. Amrita Singh and Ravi Shastri's romance ended in the 1980s.  Bollywood and cricket are two worlds that capture the hearts of millions, not just in India but across the globe. With glamour on one side and sports stardom on the other, it’s no surprise that rumours of romances often make headlines. From dinner dates to spotted outings, the public is always curious to know if a Bollywood actress is secretly seeing a cricket star. Some rumours are quickly dismissed, while others linger for years. Let’s take a closer look at the actresses who were linked to cricketers.Sara Ali Khan and Shubman GillSara Ali Khan sparks dating buzz after gurudwara visit with rumoured beau Arjun BajwaRumours of a relationship between Sara Ali Khan and cricketer Shubman Gill began when they were spotted together on a dinner date. However, Sara addressed the speculation on 'Koffee With Karan' Season 8. With humour, she said, “You have got the wrong Sara, guys. Sara ka sara duniya galat Sara ke peechay pada hai.” This may have been a reference to Sara Tendulkar, daughter of cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar, who was also rumoured to be dating the young cricketer.Nidhhi Agerwal and KL RahulNidhhi Agerwal, who works in Telugu, Tamil and Hindi films, was rumoured to be dating cricketer KL Rahul after they were seen together several times. Both made it clear they were only friends. KL Rahul had told NDTV, “I have known her for a long time, we both come from the same city. It's great to see the progress she is making in her field. We have known each other even when I was a cricketer and she was a Bollywood actress. It was not just me and her hanging out, there were three or four more people from Bangalore. It's good to catch up with friends and I assure you there is nothing happening.” KL Rahul is now married to actress Athiya Shetty, and the couple welcomed daughter Evaarah earlier this yearPollShould celebrities openly address relationship rumors more often?Yes, it avoids misunderstandingsNo, personal life should stay privateIzabelle Leite and Virat KohliBrazilian model and actress Izabelle Leite seen in movies like ‘Talaash’ reportedly dated cricketer Virat Kohli for almost two years. She had told Bollywood Hungama, “Virat was one of the first Indian friends I had when I came to India. We were dating for quite a while. We were together for almost two years. But we didn't want to make it public. So yeah, Virat and I did have a relationship. But Sidharth is only my friend and yes, we do spend time together as well.”Deepika Padukone and Yuvraj SinghBack in time, Deepika Padukone and cricketer Yuvraj Singh were seen together on dinner dates, leading to dating rumours. As quoted by Telegraph India, Yuvraj explained, “I had just come back from South Africa and we met through common friends in Mumbai. We liked each other and wanted to know more.” However, their busy schedules prevented a long-term relationship.He added, “We didn’t spend enough time with each other to know if it was going to be a long-term thing. As things turned out she moved on and so did I. Well, she was with me and now she's moved on with another person. I guess it's her personal choice. If someone wants to move out of a relationship, there isn't much that the other person can do. I am not blaming anyone but just stating the facts.”Sushmita Sen and Wasim AkramSushmita Sen and Pakistani cricketer Wasim Akram were judging the reality show 'Ek Khiladi Ek Haseena' in 2008. Their closeness sparked rumours of a relationship, as they were seen together on multiple occasions. Sushmita later cleared the air on social media, “Hi guys! Been reading about my upcoming wedding with Wasim... ABSOLUTE RUBBISH!!! Goes to show just how irresponsible media can be sometimes! Wasim Akram is a friend and will always be one!! He has a wonderful lady in his life... rumours like these are uncalled for n disrespectful! My beautiful people..when I find 'THE ONE'...you'll be the first to know :)) benefits of being my twitter family!! ;) love u all soooooo much.”Amrita Singh and Ravi ShastriBack in the 1980s, Amrita Singh and cricketer Ravi Shastri were rumoured to be dating. Amrita was often seen cheering for Ravi from the stands. However, the relationship ended, and both went on to marry other people, Amrita tied the knot with Saif Ali Khan and Ravi married Ritu Singh. In a throwback video Ravi had recalled a shy first meeting with Amrita, “When I first met my girlfriend, Amrita, you might know her from films, it was at a restaurant in Mumbai. For the first ten minutes, I didn't say a word. I always knew I was shy around girls, but I didn't expect to be completely speechless. She kept talking for the entire ten minutes. It was one of my most embarrassing moments.”"Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

He highlights the couple's request for authentic, unretouched images and the overwhelming reach of his work, even to unexpected corners of India. While unfazed by Virat, Radhik admits being star-struck photographing Priyanka Chopra's wedding to Nick Jonas.  Celebrity photographer Joseph Radhik, who captured the intimate and dreamy wedding of Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma in Tuscany in 2017, has opened up about his experience, capturing priceless moments from the couple's special day. Shooting the Virushka weddingThe celebrity photographer, who appeared on a news channel, spilled the beans about the hush-hush wedding and revealed why it still is his favourite celebrity wedding to date. Calling it one of the most defining moments of his career, Radhik revealed to News18, "When I shot Virat-Anushka's wedding in 2017, it was extremely special for me. It is a photographer's dream for their work to be seen by a few million people. To think that my work went so viral in that moment, and to think that so many people saw it across the world... that was surreal.”Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma’s Secret London Date Caught on CameraPhotos going viralThe photographer also recalled how overwhelming it was to see his images reach unexpected corners of India. While admitting other photographers often argue about the copyright of their images, he said, "But I was on the other end, super happy, grinning to see my images on places like a barber shop in Udaipur, on a pathaka dabba, or somewhere on the back of an auto. That entire year after Virat and Anushka's wedding was sublime.”Favourite photoWhen asked to pick his favourite photo from the entire wedding album, he revealed that Virat kissing Anushka on her forehead during the wedding celebrations was his favourite. Anushka's brief before the weddingWhen asked about the brief given to him, Radhik shared that Anushka had only one request, which was - to keep the images real. He shared with the portal, “Their input primarily was that I should be there to document the wedding, so that the world can see the kind of wedding they had, without any input from me or them during those moments."The photographer, who has been the man behind some of the biggest celeb weddings to date, including Vicky Kaushal and Katrina Kaif to Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas, he shared, "The brides mostly gave me the brief." He went on to add that when it came to Virat and Anushka's wedding, the photos were not even retouched in any way. He pointed out, "You can even see the crow's feet near their eyes. None of these images were retouched. It was just me editing and sharing them within minutes."On being star-struckDespite being a lifelong cricket fan, Radhik said he did not feel star-struck photographing the star couple. He noted, "Those two were just so happy, there was no star presence around them. I was just grinning from left to right that day."However, he admitted that one celebrity wedding did leave him awe-struck was that of Priyanka Chopra’s grand wedding to Nick Jonas. “I’ve always been a Desi Girl fan. When she was getting ready in her red lehenga, Mickey Contractor doing her makeup, I just thought, ‘Oh my God, I’m photographing Priyanka Chopra’s wedding,’” he confessed.Viral and Anushka were recently in the news when the two were spotted enjoying a quiet day out and about the streets of London. The couple was seen rocking a casual look as they stepped out and even spent a while chatting with locals around a street corner. According to reports they have decided to shift base to the UK to raise their two children Vamika and Akaay, away from the spotlight."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Mohit Suri's romantic musical drama, 'Saiyaara,' starring Ahaan Panday and Anette Padda, has grossed Rs 325.11 crore in 33 days. Despite competition from 'Coolie' and 'War 2,' the film sustained footfalls, driven by positive word-of-mouth and repeat viewings, especially among younger audiences. Cinema chains have re-added shows due to continued demand. 'Saiyaara' has become the 14th biggest hit in Hindi cinema. Mohit Suri’s Saiyaara, starring Ahaan Panday and Anette Padda, has crossed yet another milestone at the box office. The romantic musical drama has now collected Rs 325.11 crore in 33 days. The film has added Rs 2.51crore to its collection since the release of Rajinikanth’s Coolie and Hrithik Roshan-Jr NTR starrer War 2 which accounted for most screens across the country.The film opened to a steady start on Day 1 with Rs 21.5 crore, followed by strong weekday hold and an impressive weekend surge, peaking at Rs 35.75 crore on its third day. By the end of its first week the film had collected Rs 172.75 crore, Week 2 stood at Rs 107.75 crore, Week 3 was at 28.25 crore and in Week 4 the film collected Rs 14.1 crore and after counting six days of week 5, the film’s total collection now stands at RS 325.11 crore. Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda’s chemistry steals the show at 'Saiyaara' success bashWhile facing tough competition from Coolie and War 2 and with least number of shows in its journey the film maintained a steady inflow of footfalls. Word of mouth and repeat viewing, especially among younger audiences who connected with its music and tender love story, kept the numbers ticking. As soon as the weekend rush for Coolie and War 2 began to stabilize, cinema chains across the country took note of the sustained demand for Saiyaara. This week, several multiplexes and even single-screen theatres have re-added shows for the film to cater to its growing popularity.This renewed demand comes at a crucial juncture. On Day 33, Saiyaara added Rs31 lakhs to its tally, pushing the film past the coveted Rs 325 crore benchmark. The film has already become the 14th biggest hit of Hindi Cinema but it seems unlikely the film will be able to make it to the 13th rank as that is taken by Salman Khan’s Tiger Zinda Hai with Rs 339.16 crore collection.

Despite competition from 'War 2', 'Coolie' reaffirms Rajinikanth's box office dominance. 'Mahavatar Narsimha', an animated film, has earned Rs 215.49 crore, marking a milestone as the first Indian animation to cross Rs 200 crore, highlighting diverse audience preferences.

Rajinikanth's 'Coolie' has swiftly grossed Rs 216 crore in six days, surpassing 'Mahavatar Narsimha' as the third-highest grosser of 2025. Despite competition from 'War 2', 'Coolie' reaffirms Rajinikanth's box office dominance. 'Mahavatar Narsimha', an animated film, has earned Rs 215.49 crore, marking a milestone as the first Indian animation to cross Rs 200 crore, highlighting diverse audience preferences. The year 2025 has already proven to be a landmark year for Indian cinema at the box office. From big-ticket star vehicles to high-concept experiments, audiences have turned out in large numbers, rewarding both spectacle and novelty. This week, Rajinikanth’s Coolie added another milestone to the record books by edging out Mahavatar Narsimha to become the third biggest grosser of the year so far, amassing Rs 216 crore in just six days of its release.The first two spots have been captured by Vicky Kaushal's Chhaava with Rs 601.57 crore and Mohit Suri's Saiyaara with Rs 325.11 crore. When it comes to Coolie it's major collections have come from Tamil version while for Mahavatar Narsimha, the Hindi version has led the charge. According to trade figures, Coolie opened with a thunderous Rs 65 crore on Thursday, riding on Rajinikanth’s pan-India appeal and high anticipation surrounding Lokesh Kanagaraj’s directorial. The film maintained strong momentum over its extended opening weekend, posting Rs 54.75 crore on Friday, Rs 39.5 crore on Saturday, and Rs 35.25 crore on Sunday. Even though collections dropped on Monday and Tuesday Rs 12 crore and Rs 9.5 crore respectively, the six-day total stood at a formidable Rs 216 crore.Rajinikanth turns 50 in cinema: Fans go crazy, stars shower praiseThis tally puts Coolie just above Mahavatar Narsimha, which is holding out on screens despite facing competition from all big films since its release. The film in its 25 day run till now has collected Rs 215.49 crore. While the difference is marginal, the achievement is significant considering the competition both films faced in their theatrical journeys.For Rajinikanth, Coolie reaffirms his box office dominance after Jailer, and now joins his career’s biggest successes behind 2.0 and Jailer. The film’s success comes despite clashing with War 2 headlined by Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR.On the other hand, Mahavatar Narsimha deserves equal recognition for carving its own unique chapter in 2025’s box office story. Directed by Ashwin Kumar, the animated mythological spectacle defied conventional expectations by not only sustaining against heavyweights like Saiyaara, Son of Sardaar 2, War 2, and eventually Coolie, but also by emerging as the first Indian animation film ever to cross the Rs 200 crore mark. The Hindi version of the film has till now collected Rs 163.49 crore making it the sixth biggest Hindi hit of the year, trailing behind Aamir Khan’s Sitaare Zameen Par in the Hindi market.What makes this comparison remarkable is the sheer contrast between the two films. Coolie is a Rajinikanth action entertainer designed for mass appeal, while Mahavatar Narsimha relied on storytelling innovation and the growing acceptance of animation features in India. That both films managed to cross Rs 215 crore in the same year underscores the diversity of Indian audiences’ tastes and their willingness to embrace both spectacle and substance.But while the box office collection is similar, Mahavatar is already into profit zone and its return on investment is going to be huge as compared to Coolie which is losing audience with each passing day. The true test for Coolie would be if the collections can spike over the second weekend as no new big film is releasing.
