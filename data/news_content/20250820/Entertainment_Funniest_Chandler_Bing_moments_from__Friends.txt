On his birth anniversary, let’s look back at some of his funniest and most unforgettable moments from ‘Friends’ that continue to bring smiles to millions of fans around the world.2/6​Trapped in the ATM vestibule with Jill GoodacreOne of the earliest classic Chandler moments comes when he gets stuck in an ATM vestibule during a city blackout. To make things even more awkward, he is trapped with Victoria’s Secret model Jill Goodacre and Chandler’s nervousness takes over, and we hear his hilarious inner monologue as he struggles to say something “cool” but ends up embarrassing himself instead. His physical comedy shines when he tries to act normal while choking on chewing gum.3/6​"I am moving to yemen!” to escape JaniceChandler’s on-and-off relationship with Janice gave the show some of its funniest storylines. In one episode, he is so desperate to avoid breaking up with her that he blurts out he is moving to Yemen. Janice insists on seeing him off, and Chandler actually buys a ticket to Yemen just to keep the lie going and watching him at the airport, uncomfortably saying goodbye while realizing he might actually have to board the plane, is peak Chandler also his exaggerated expressions and sarcastic remarks make the scene unforgettable.4/6​The “Pivot!” couch disasterOne of the most iconic Friends moments comes when Ross buys a couch and asks Chandler and Rachel to help him move it upstairs. The stairway is too narrow, and Ross keeps screaming “Pivot! Pivot!” While Chandler grows more frustrated and his sarcastic delivery of “Shut up, shut up, shut uuuup!” is one of the funniest lines in the entire series also Chandler’s mixture of exhaustion and wit is what makes the scene so hilarious.5/6​Eating cheesecake off the floorChandler and Rachel accidentally find a cheesecake that doesn’t belong to them, but it tastes so good they can’t resist. At first, they sneak bites, then they argue over it, and eventually, the cheesecake falls on the floor. Instead of stopping, both Chandler and Rachel sit down and eat it off the floor with forks. The sight of Chandler fully enjoying food in such an absurd situation is hilarious.6/6​The bunny costume fiascoIn the Halloween episode, Chandler shows up dressed as a giant pink bunny because Monica wanted him to wear it and his embarrassment is clear from the moment he walks in, and his sarcastic complaints make the costume even funnier. When Joey arrives dressed as Chandler, the situation gets even more hilarious and also Chandler, who always prided himself on being sarcastic and smart, is forced into looking completely ridiculous.Follow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousNayanthara’s transformation: Glowing brighter with timeindiaTop 5 zodiac signs who are truly spiritual soulsindia9 vegetarian-friendly
