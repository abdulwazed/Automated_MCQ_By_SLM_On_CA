Alexander Isak has not been involved in Newcastle United's pre-season games or start to the Premier League. (AP) Newcastle striker Alexander Isak has broken his silence regarding his potential transfer to Liverpool, stating his departure would be "in the best interests of everyone" amid speculation of a £110 million bid from the Merseyside club. The Swedish international, who has not played in pre-season or Newcastle's opening game, expressed his frustration over broken promises and lost trust through an Instagram post on Tuesday.Liverpool's reported £110 million bid for the 25-year-old striker was rejected by Newcastle, who are demanding a British transfer record fee of up to £150 million.Isak chose not to attend the Professional Footballers' Association awards ceremony despite being named in the Premier League 2024/25 team of the year.Alexander Isak's Instagram Story on his desired move out of Newcastle United."I've kept quiet for a long time while others have spoken. That silence has allowed people to push their own version of events, even though they know it doesn't reflect what was really said and agreed behind closed doors," Isak posted on Instagram. "The reality is that promises were made and the club has known my position for a long time. To now act as if these issues are only emerging is misleading. When promises are broken and trust is lost, the relationship can't continue. That's where things are for me right now - and why change is in the best interests of everyone, not just myself."Reports suggest Newcastle had promised Isak an improved contract but delayed due to financial sustainability rules.Newcastle responded with their own statement expressing disappointment at Isak's social media post.Statement by Newcastle United in response to Alexander Isak's social media post."We are disappointed to have been alerted to a social media post by Alexander Isak this evening," the club stated. "We are clear in response that Alex remains under contract and that no commitment has ever been made by a club official that Alex can leave Newcastle United this summer. We want to keep our best players, but we also understand players have their own wishes and we listen to their views."The club added that Isak remains part of their family and would be welcomed back when ready to rejoin his teammates.Since joining from Real Sociedad in 2022, Isak has scored 62 goals in 109 appearances for Newcastle, including the winning goal against Liverpool in the League Cup final that ended Newcastle's 70-year trophy drought.Liverpool have already invested £300 million in squad improvements this season while recouping over £200 million through sales.The Merseyside club is seeking attacking reinforcements following the departures of Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez, and the tragic death of Diogo Jota.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
