Found during the first major excavation on the island in more than 30 years, the discovery marks a significant moment in the UAE’s archaeological record and strengthens the narrative of its multicultural past.A rediscovery three decades in the makingIn January 2025, the Department of Culture and Tourism – Abu Dhabi (DCT Abu Dhabi) launched a new archaeological campaign on Sir Bani Yas Island, located off the coast of the Al Dhafra region. This marked the first major excavation on the island in over 30 years. Among the season’s most significant findings was a Christian cross, moulded on a plaster (stucco) plaque, uncovered within one of the courtyard buildings near a historic monastery. The cross, believed to have been used by monks for spiritual reflection, is linked to the Church of the East, an early Christian denomination with origins in ancient Iraq. It bears stylistic similarities to religious artefacts previously found in Iraq and Kuwait, pointing to the monastery’s connection with a broader religious network that once spanned from the Middle East to as far as China. Measuring 27 centimetres in length, 17 centimetres in width, and about 2 centimetres thick, the plaster cross is adorned with regional motifs. These include a stepped pyramid representing Golgotha, the hill where Jesus is believed to have been crucified, sprouting leaves at the base, dots at the tips of the cross arms, and an arched niche design. According to archaeologist Maria Gajewska, who leads the excavation team, “Visually, every element of the plaster cross incorporates regional motifs… all find regional parallels in the Gulf and Mesopotamia.” Speaking to The National, Gajewska described the discovery as “an extremely exciting find” and a rare instance where archaeologists can clearly identify the community that once occupied a space. “We were just digging in the right place… Incredible,” she said.The story behind the find The cross was discovered face down in February 2025 by Hager Al Menhali, an Emirati archaeologist with DCT Abu Dhabi. “The plaster was resting face down and something about it caught my attention,” she told The National. “There was a distinct fingerprint on the back.” Thinking the print alone was significant, Al Menhali proposed registering the object as a special find. But when the team carefully turned it over, they were stunned to see a well-preserved cross. “This was one of the most significant discoveries of the season,” said Al Menhali. The discovery took place within a courtyard house to the north of the island’s main church and monastery site, an area that had not been explored in depth until this season. This zone is now considered to have been used by monks in retreat or seclusion. The surrounding buildings, some constructed with limestone and coral native to the island, feature thick walls and water cisterns, indications of a lifestyle more comfortable than one of strict asceticism. These features suggest the early Christian residents were not merely hermits but members of a larger, structured monastic community.Unearthing a rich and layered past Sir Bani Yas has long held archaeological significance. A Christian monastery dating back to the seventh or eighth century CE was first discovered there in 1992 by the Abu Dhabi Islands Archaeological Survey (ADIAS), under the UAE’s leadership. Since then, excavations have revealed a church and monastic complex believed to have operated simultaneously. Current interpretations suggest that while the monastery served as a broader communal religious site, individual monks would retreat to courtyard homes nearby for isolated contemplation. The recent discovery of the plaster cross provides strong evidence that Christianity was not confined to the monastery, but permeated other parts of the island community. At its peak, Christianity in the Arabian Peninsula thrived between the fourth and sixth centuries CE. Sir Bani Yas is part of a network of Christian sites that emerged during this period, with parallels found in Umm Al Quwain, Kuwait, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. Christianity on the island is believed to have coexisted with Islam until the eighth century CE, when the site was peacefully abandoned. Interestingly, the archaeological team has found no evidence of sudden destruction or conflict at the site. Instead, the clean and intact condition of the buildings suggests an intentional departure, possibly with the expectation of return. Additional finds from this season include pottery fragments and a sea-green glass bottle, likely used to hold oil or rosewater. These artefacts, along with others such as a stamp seal with a scorpion motif and glass chalices from earlier digs, are now on display at a small on-site exhibition.Preservation and the path ahead The Sir Bani Yas church and monastery are now sheltered and preserved, thanks to restoration works carried out by DCT Abu Dhabi in 2019. The site is open to the public, featuring improved signage and visitor facilities. A multi-faith church, inspired by the original structures, has also been constructed near the visitor centre to symbolise the values of unity and coexistence.Further excavation is planned at the courtyard houses, with the intention of integrating them into a larger cultural trail connecting significant sites across the island. Native wildlife, including Arabian gazelles and rock hyraxes, species known to inhabit the island since ancient times, are also part of the broader heritage landscape. DCT Abu Dhabi is conducting radiocarbon dating and in-depth analysis of the newly unearthed artefacts.Mohamed Khalifa Al Mubarak, Chairman of DCT Abu Dhabi, emphasised the wider significance of the discovery, linking it to the UAE’s enduring cultural values.“The discovery of this ancient Christian cross on Sir Bani Yas Island is a powerful testament to the UAE’s profound and enduring values of coexistence and cultural openness. It stirs within us a deep sense of pride and honour and reminds us that peaceful coexistence is not a modern construct, but a principle woven into the very fabric of our region’s history.”He also highlighted the long-term impact of archaeological work on the island and its relevance for future generations:“The ongoing discoveries from Sir Bani Yas Island, even after 30 years of research and excavation, underscore the magnitude of our cultural legacy and the importance of our continued commitment to its preservation and understanding… These discoveries deepen our connection to the past and inspire future generations to embrace the spirit of unity and mutual respect that has long defined our community.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
