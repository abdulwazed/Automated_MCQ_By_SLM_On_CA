Sanju Samson  Shubman Gill's selection as vice-captain for the upcoming Asia Cup in the UAE has sparked discussions about Sanju Samson's position in India's T20 team, despite his inclusion in the squad. The order in which selection committee chairman Ajit Agarkar announced the team has led to speculation about the final playing XI, with Gill possibly opening alongside Abhishek Sharma in India's first match against Oman.Chief selector Ajit Agarkar's announcement sequence, naming Gill and Jitesh Sharma before Samson and Rinku Singh, has fueled speculation about team composition.

This arrangement leaves limited opportunities for Samson at the top order.Former India spinner R Ashwin has made a scathing attack on Team India's management for picking Shubman Gill in the side."They are thinking of Shubman Gill as the leader for the future. Maybe he can be the all-format captain. But it is not necessary to have the same captain in all formats,” Ashwin said on his YouTube channel "Ash Ki Baat."PollWho do you think should open the batting for India against Oman?Shubman GillAbhishek SharmaBoth of them“What is sadder is that you have announced Gill as the vice-captain, so Sanju Samson's place is also under threat. Sanju is not going to play. Shubman Gill will play, and he will open the batting,” he added. Agarkar addressed the selection matter by deferring to the team management's decision. "The captain-coach will take the call on the best balance for the team. Once we get to Dubai, we will have a bit more clarity.
