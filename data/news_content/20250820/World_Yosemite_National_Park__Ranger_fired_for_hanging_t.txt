This action, done in protest of Trump administration policies, led to stricter park rules on banners and flags. Two other rangers are under investigation, and the Justice Department is considering actions against those involved, sparking condemnation from advocates. Ranger fired for hanging transgender pride flag on El Capitan A ranger at Yosemite National Park has been dismissed after helping drape a giant transgender pride flag across El Capitan, sparking a wider crackdown on protests at the California landmark.Shannon “SJ” Joslin, a 35-year-old ranger and biologist who studies bats, confirmed they were terminated last week after unfurling the 66-foot-wide flag on 20 May with a group of climbers. The flag, which remained for around two hours, was removed voluntarily. In a letter of dismissal, Yosemite’s acting deputy superintendent said Joslin had “failed to demonstrate acceptable conduct” in their role as a federal employee, reported The New York Times.Joslin, who identifies as nonbinary, was quoted as saying by news agency AP that she had acted out of personal conviction amid policies from the Trump administration that “target trans people.” She added, “I hung the flag as a way to tell myself we’re safe in national parks. Instead, this firing says the opposite, that federal workers who don’t align with this administration must stay silent or be eliminated.”Two other rangers who joined the action have been placed on administrative leave pending investigation, Joslin said. Park officials confirmed the justice department is considering administrative and possible criminal action against both employees and visitors involved. Violators could face fines of up to $5,000 and jail terms of six months.The Park Service tightened rules a day after the incident, banning flags or banners larger than 15 square feet in 94% of the park. “Displaying signs, banners and flags outside of designated First Amendment areas detracts from the visitor experience,” said spokesperson Rachel Pawlitz, as cited by AP.Yosemite, she added, must balance free expression with the protection of wilderness and visitor safety.Advocates have condemned the firing. Environmentalist and drag performer Pattie Gonia, who joined in hanging the flag, was quoted by AP as she called Joslin “a respected pillar within the Yosemite community.” Jayson O’Neill from Save Our Parks claimed the decision was meant to intimidate workers from speaking out, while Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility is now representing Joslin.Demonstrations at El Capitan have become more frequent. Earlier this year, protesters displayed an inverted US flag to criticise Trump-era cuts to the Park Service workforce. Since Trump took office, the service has lost about 2,500 employees, with a further $900 million cut proposed for next year, according to AP.For Joslin, Yosemite was more than a workplace. “Everything I did was off the clock and had nothing to do with my role,” she was quoted as saying by The New York Times. “Yosemite is my whole life”, she added.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
