These modules detail the mission launched in response to the Pahalgam terror attack, showcasing India's military capabilities and the unity displayed across the nation.

File photo The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has launched two specially designed modules on Operation Sindoor for students of classes 3 to 12, aiming to bring lessons of courage, strategy, and national pride straight into the classroom. Far more than a military story, these modules frame Operation Sindoor as a promise to protect peace and honour the lives lost during the Pahalgam terror attack, as reported by PTI.According to ANI, the modules are being introduced as supplementary curriculum material, featuring maps of precision strikes, images of downed Pakistani drones, and Made-in-India defence systems. Written in a conversational style between teachers and students, they make complex military events accessible and engaging for young learnersI.Modules tailored for different stagesThe modules designed by NCERT are as follows:Classes 3 to 8: “Operation Sindoor — A Saga of Valour” focuses on courage, empathy, and the human side of the mission.Classes 9 to 12: “Operation Sindoor — A Mission of Honour and Bravery” provides a deeper look at strategic objectives, technological advances, and India’s military prowess.According to PTI, the modules explain that although Pakistan denied involvement in the Pahalgam attack, it was carried out on “direct orders by Pakistan’s military and political leadership.” On April 22, 2025, terrorists from The Resistance Front (TRF), a known proxy of Lashkar-e-Taiba, opened fire on tourists in Baisaran Valley, killing 26 people, including a Nepali citizen.Lessons from the pastStudents are introduced to earlier events to provide context:The Pulwama attack in February 2019, which killed 40 CRPF personnel.The Balakot airstrikes later that month, in which Mirage 2000 jets destroyed a Jaish-e-Mohammed training camp.The abrogation of Article 370, which brought peace, infrastructure development, improved schools, and increased tourism to Jammu and Kashmir. ANI notes that Pakistan was reportedly unsettled by these changes.Operation Sindoor: A precise and coordinated missionLaunched on May 7, 2025, at 1:05 am, Operation Sindoor targeted nine terror bases in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, including the key hubs of Muridke and Bahawalpur. In just 22 minutes, the Indian Army and Air Force neutralized the camps using Rafale and Su-30MKI jets, BrahMos missiles, drones, and ISRO satellite surveillance, PTI reports.Despite Pakistan’s retaliatory attempts using drones, artillery, and missiles, India’s multi-layered air defence system, including S-400 and Akash, prevented any damage to critical assets or civilian areas. The Navy asserted maritime dominance in the Arabian Sea, and the Border Security Force successfully foiled infiltration attempts.National unity and solidarityThe modules emphasise how India stood together in the wake of the attack. Candlelight marches were held nationwide, Muslim communities in Hyderabad, Lucknow, and Bhopal wore black armbands in protest, and border villages demanded strong action in support of the Armed Forces. In Kashmir, shopkeepers closed their shops to protest, and local communities actively denounced terrorism, breaking stereotypes and highlighting the voice of peace-loving citizens.The operation’s name, Sindoor, was chosen to honour the widows of the victims, symbolizing empathy, solidarity, and respect. Prime Minister Modi described it as a tribute that underscores both national courage and personal compassion.Technology, diplomacy, and national prideThe modules spotlight India’s technological self-reliance, showcasing indigenous jets, missiles, drones, and satellites. These modules also highlight how the operation demonstrated the effectiveness of the Make in India defence push, combining innovation with precision. Diplomatically, the modules also note that India successfully persuaded the US to officially declare TRF a foreign terrorist organisation in July 2025, PTI reports.Summing up, NCERT describes Operation Sindoor as “a military success, a technological breakthrough, and a political message all rolled into one—a triumph of bravery, strategy, and innovation,” as reported by ANI. By bringing this story into classrooms, NCERT hopes to inspire students with lessons of courage, unity, and patriotism, while also raising awareness about India’s defence capabilities and the importance of standing up against terrorism.Ready to navigate global policies?
