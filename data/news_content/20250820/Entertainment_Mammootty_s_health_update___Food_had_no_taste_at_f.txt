Sreeraman has now opened up about further updates regarding the legendary actor Mammootty's health and also glimpses into their deep bond.Mammootty says -'Food had no taste, smell was gone'Sreeraman revealed to Manorama News that Mammootty himself had spoken about the struggles he faced in the early stages of treatment. “During the early stages of treatment, he said food had no taste and he had lost his sense of smell. Now all that has changed. He’ll soon return to the crowd. Mammootty himself called and said he is completely cured,” he said.Despite the difficult phase, Sreeraman noted that Mammootty never allowed his illness to define him. “There’s never been any sign of weakness in his voice, never like a patient’s. The same strength, the same energy, as always,” he recalled.Mammootty walks down memory lane as he revisits his college!'Mammootty calls me regularly — sometimes once a week'The two friends spoke frequently, often about anything other than health. “He calls me regularly — sometimes once a week. At first, when he used to call, he would mention that food had no taste, or that it was hard to walk. But he never gave much importance to those issues. Mostly, our conversations were about other things — sometimes politics, sometimes farming, sometimes random topics,” Sreeraman shared.Mammootty, he added, often challenged his opinions, jokingly calling him out when he tried to avoid giving a clear answer. “If I run out of things to say, he jokes, ‘So you’re pretending to be an intellectual without any real knowledge?’” Sreeraman said with a smile.'yesterday, he spent a long time explaining different cameras to me'Even during illness, Mammootty’s curiosity and passion for life remained unchanged. “Yesterday, he spent a long time explaining different cameras to me — like the Fuji, and also the handmade camera carried to the moon by the first astronauts,” Sreeraman said, describing the megastar’s childlike enthusiasm.He added that Mammootty has also been talking about farming and trees he has planted at his home. “I was always certain he would come back, and now I’m even more sure,” Sreeraman said, assuring fans that their beloved actor is well on the road to recovery."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorEntertainment Deskमटा मनोरंजन डेस्क ही मराठी आणि हिंदी चित्रपट, ओटीटी, संगीत, मराठी टीव्ही कार्यक्रम, वेब सिरीज आणि सेलिब्रिटी बातम्यांवर केंद्रित एक उत्साही टीम आहे. चित्रपट समीक्षण, कलाकारांच्या मुलाखती, ट्रेलर विश्लेषण, गॉसिप्स आणि सोशल मीडिया ट्रेंड्सवरील विश्वासार्ह आणि मनोरंजक माहिती आम्ही सर्जनशील शैलीत वाचकांपर्यंत पोहोचवितो. माहिती आणि मनोरंजन यांचा समतोल राखणे हे आमचे वैशिष्ट्य आहे.Read MoreEnd of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous10 animals on the planet known for their loudnessLifestyleAnushka-Virat, Ranveer-Deepika to Sidharth-Kiara: Most memorable celebrity pregnancy announcements of all timeEntertainmentHow to use Kumkumadi Tailam to get that everlasting glow on the faceLifestyle9 simple tips to lower blood pressure naturallyLifestyleIn pics: Adorable looks of Chandhini PrakashtvZodiac signs that feel loneliness the mostastrologyLife lessons to learn from Samantha Ruth PrabhuEntertainmentNayanthara’s transformation: Glowing brighter with timeEntertainmentTop 5 zodiac signs who are truly spiritual soulsastrologyVerdict of Rajinikanth's last 10 films before 'Coolie'Entertainment Next123 Photostories  From recalling how Kapil Sharma helped her when she was ‘inappropriately touched’ to dealing with body shaming comments: Bharti Singh makes shocking revelations5 South Indian dishes that celebrate coconut in every biteCan drinking Orange Clove Ginger tea heal severe sore throatFrom Theft Allegations to Ganja Case Summons: Times when Bigg Boss Malayalam 6 winner Jinto courted controversy409 mm in 36 hours: Relentless rain cripples Mumbai; roads, rail and air traffic hitFrom Vanitha Vijayakumar to Priyanka Deshpande: A look at the winners of Cooku With ComaliDiabetes: 6 unusual symptoms you’d never guess are linked to high blood sugar (detecting them early can help manage diabetes naturally)Bollywood's cutest child actors: From Ahsaas Channa to Darsheel Safarey, the actors who stole our hearts from a young age11 timeless sweets from different states of IndiaTimes when Shweta Tiwari’s proved she’s aging in reverse123Top TrendingFree Doctor Strange Skin in Marvel RivalsJean PormanoveOnline Gaming BillDennis RodmanTyson BagentLeon Draisaitl wifeAndy RoddickTom BradyNHL Trade NewsTaylor SwiftTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website“The most beautiful bride’: Leon Draisaitl’s wife Celeste Desjardins reacts to Warren Foegele and Alexandra Servos’ Toronto weddingEarth split captured on camera for the first time: Why it is a breakthrough for earthquake science‘If Indian goods cannot go to US, they can head to…’: Russia slams ‘unjustified’ Trump sanctions on oil; Putin to meet PM Modi in India this year'Tomorrow not promised': YouTubers were enjoying a meal when SUV smashed through glass and into them - watch viral video'Gut-wrenching': Kristi Noem reacts to Indian truck driver Harjinder Singh killing 3 in Florida in accident, blames Newsom'Gave some papers, then hit her': Delhi CM Rekha Gupta 'attacked' during 'Jan Sunwai'; man arrestedAsia Cup 2025: Complete squads of all teams, fixtures'How much have they paid you?': US lawmaker slammed for joining India Fest, he pushes backAsia Cup | 'Shreyas Iyer is not liked as much as ...
