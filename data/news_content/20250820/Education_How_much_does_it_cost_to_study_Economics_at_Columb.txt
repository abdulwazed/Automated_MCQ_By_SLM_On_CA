It is located in New York City. The program is expensive. Undergraduates may pay around $95,000 yearly. Masters students spend about $95,422 annually. Costs include tuition, living, and health insurance. Financial aid is available. Columbia offers access to Wall Street and global firms. Many students find the investment worthwhile for career prospects.  For thousands of students worldwide, Columbia University remains a dream destination to study Economics. Situated in the heart of New York City, Columbia offers one of the most sought-after Economics programs in the Ivy League. But behind the prestige comes a steep price tag. For the 2025 academic year, tuition, fees, and living expenses combine to make it one of the most expensive education investments globally.The undergraduate costAn undergraduate degree in Economics at Columbia comes with an annual tuition and fee structure ranging from $68,000 to $71,170. On top of this, students spend about $17,000 to $18,680 on housing and meals. Columbia also requires all students to purchase health insurance, priced at around $4,955 annually. Books and personal expenses add another $4,000.Taken together, the total cost for one year of undergraduate study lies between $90,000 and $95,000. Over a standard four-year program, this can amount to nearly $380,000, not including the yearly increments that universities typically introduce.Cost of master’s in economicsFor students pursuing a master’s in Economics, the financial demands remain equally high. Tuition alone is pegged at $67,320 for the year. Living in New York City—whether on or off campus—adds close to $21,897. Mandatory health insurance contributes $4,955, while books and supplies bring in an additional $1,250.That brings the total annual cost to approximately $95,422. With most MA programs running for two years, graduates can expect to spend close to $190,000 in total.The hidden expensesThe official numbers only tell part of the story. Costs at Columbia rise incrementally every year, meaning students should be prepared for annual hikes in both tuition and housing. For international students, the financial burden is heavier still, with visa fees, airfare, and potential insurance top-ups adding to the overall bill. Living in New York City can also be more expensive than the university’s estimates, particularly for those opting for off-campus housing.Can students get financial aid?Columbia’s undergraduate students benefit from need-based financial aid, and the university is known to meet 100 percent of demonstrated financial need for admitted students. For graduate students, the options are fewer but include competitive fellowships, teaching assistantships, and research assistantships. While these can ease the financial load, they are not guaranteed, especially for international applicants.Why students still choose ColumbiaDespite the daunting costs, Columbia University continues to draw students from across the world. Its Economics program is consistently ranked among the best, with faculty expertise spanning everything from global finance to development economics. Its location in New York offers unparalleled access to Wall Street, multinational firms, the United Nations, and leading policy think tanks—making it a unique launchpad for careers in economics, finance, and policymaking.The takeawayStudying Economics at Columbia University in 2025 is a six-figure annual investment, with undergraduates paying up to $95,000 per year and graduate students spending around $95,422. For many, this investment is justified by Columbia’s academic reputation, global networking opportunities, and the career pathways it opens. For aspiring economists, the challenge is not only gaining admission but also ensuring they can meet the significant financial commitment.Ready to navigate global policies?
