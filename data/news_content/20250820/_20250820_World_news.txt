‘Lucky charm’: How a Ukrainian designer styled Zelenskyy for Trump meeting; black suit carried subtle detail
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with US President Donald Trump in a military-style attire designed by Viktor Anisimov, a subtle shift from his usual wartime look. Anisimov aimed to incorporate civilian elements, hoping it would serve as a 'lucky charm' for peace. Trump praised Zelenskyy's outfit, a contrast to a previous tense meeting.

Anisimov aimed to incorporate civilian elements, hoping it would serve as a 'lucky charm' for peace. Trump praised Zelenskyy's outfit, a contrast to a previous tense meeting. Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump (AP) Volodymyr Zelenskyy (PTI) Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump (AP) Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump (AP) Volodymyr Zelenskyy (PTI) Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump (AP) Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump (AP) 123 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy once again set aside a traditional suit during his White House meeting with US President Donald Trump on Monday, choosing instead a refined version of his signature military-style attire. The outfit, designed by Ukrainian designer Viktor Anisimov, featured a black suit with a subtle black vent, a detail that brought it closer to civilian wear while maintaining the wartime aesthetic Zelenskyy has favored throughout the conflict."These are our hopes for peace," Anisimov was quoted as saying by Reuters. "We think that if we add something subtle to this image, something from civilian clothing to his uniform, then it will be like a lucky charm.”Trump praised Zelenskyy’s less formal suit as he arrived at the White House for talks on Monday, on the Russia-Ukraine war, a notable shift from their tense February meeting. Earlier this year, however, an American journalist had questioned Zelenskyy’s choice of attire during his meeting with Trump and US Vice President JD Vance.Anisimov, 61, from Ukraine’s northern Chernihiv region, said that while watching videos of the exchange, he felt the remarks were directed not only at Zelenskyy but at the Ukrainian people as a whole. "There was a slight sense of despair because they do not understand how we breathe, how we live," Anisimov said as quoted by Reuters.Zelenskyy has worn Anisimov’s designs at key moments, including the funeral of Pope Francis in April and the NATO Summit in June."I can't say that we sewed (a suit) specifically for the NATO summit or for an important conversation with Trump and European leaders. The suit is just a suit," Anisimov said. He added that Zelenskyy has about five similar-looking jackets with only small tweaks.The White House reporter, Brian Glenn, who had asked Zelenskyy in February why he was not wearing a suit, praised his outfit choice on Monday, saying, "you look fabulous in that suit".Anisimov said he was not focused on criticism or compliments this time, but on making sure the Ukrainian president appeared dignified. "They praise, they scold. If we win, and we will win, then whose suit it was doesn't matter," he said“We had already started working on the president’s new wardrobe and style in January. After what happened in February, knowing our president’s principles, I thought that he would not want to change his style. But no, he decided that we should continue,” Anisimov was quoted as saying by Womenswear Daily.“It’s not about the suit, it’s about what happens to Ukraine,” Anisimov added.This was not the first time Anisimov had been tasked with reshaping the president’s style. Back in the early 2000s, when Zelenskyy was still a comedian, Anisimov helped design the Ukrainian president's and his crew’s wardrobe. Zelenskyy pledged in 2022 that he would not return to wearing a suit and tie or shaving his beard until Ukraine achieves victory in the war, as per the Financial Times.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Bondi had sent a letter to Ferguson last week notifying him that Washington had been identified by the White House as a jurisdiction that “engages in sanctuary policies” obstructing federal immigration enforcement. She warned of consequences ranging from withholding federal grants to prosecuting officials for allegedly using their positions “to obstruct federal immigration enforcement efforts and facilitating or inducing illegal immigration.” Ferguson held a news conference shortly after noon in the State Reception Room of the Legislative Building in Olympia, where he delivered his response to the August 13 letter. Bondi’s letter had demanded that the governor drop the state’s sanctuary policies, setting a Tuesday deadline for a reply. Washington state, she wrote, was a “sanctuary” jurisdiction that frustrated federal immigration enforcement to the detriment of national interests. She further warned that officials obstructing such efforts could face criminal charges, while noncompliant local and state governments could face civil liability. “(Attorney General) Pam Bondi … seeks to have Washington state bend the knee to a Trump administration that, day by day, drags us closer to authoritarianism. That’s not going to happen,” Ferguson said. “I am not intimidated by Pam Bondi, or the president.”Citing Bondi’s letter as a dangerous escalation, Ferguson said it reflected demands that governors and mayors “bend the knee” to the president. “That is breathtaking, and a letter like this cannot be normalized,” he said. “Let me be very clear. Washington state will not be bullied or intimidated by threats and legally baseless accusations.” “In the America that I love, that I taught my children to revere, we resolve our differences peacefully through public discourse — and if necessary, through the courts — not by threatening political opponents with imprisonment,” he added. The governor highlighted the state’s 2019 law, the Keep Washington Working Act, which limits the role of local law enforcement in aiding federal authorities on immigration matters. The law bars police from arresting or detaining individuals solely based on their immigration status and prohibits jails from holding people for federal custody unless presented with a warrant or court order signed by a judge or magistrate. Ferguson and Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown have consistently defended the law, maintaining that it does not interfere with the federal government’s ability to enforce immigration laws. Brown’s office has repeatedly argued that the act does not thwart federal authority. Ferguson was joined at the news conference by immigration rights advocates, state legislators, and Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell, who had also received a similar letter from Bondi naming Seattle as a sanctuary jurisdiction. According to Bondi, the notices sent to Seattle and Washington state were part of 32 letters issued last week to governors and mayors of Democratic-led “sanctuary” jurisdictions.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The monastery complex on Sir Bani Yas Island includes courtyard houses where monks lived in seclusion, indicating a structured early Christian community/ Image: National A newly uncovered Christian cross from a seventh- to eighth-century monastery on Abu Dhabi’s Sir Bani Yas Island is offering rare insight into the region’s deep-rooted religious coexistence. Found during the first major excavation on the island in more than 30 years, the discovery marks a significant moment in the UAE’s archaeological record and strengthens the narrative of its multicultural past.A rediscovery three decades in the makingIn January 2025, the Department of Culture and Tourism – Abu Dhabi (DCT Abu Dhabi) launched a new archaeological campaign on Sir Bani Yas Island, located off the coast of the Al Dhafra region. This marked the first major excavation on the island in over 30 years. Among the season’s most significant findings was a Christian cross, moulded on a plaster (stucco) plaque, uncovered within one of the courtyard buildings near a historic monastery. The cross, believed to have been used by monks for spiritual reflection, is linked to the Church of the East, an early Christian denomination with origins in ancient Iraq. It bears stylistic similarities to religious artefacts previously found in Iraq and Kuwait, pointing to the monastery’s connection with a broader religious network that once spanned from the Middle East to as far as China. Measuring 27 centimetres in length, 17 centimetres in width, and about 2 centimetres thick, the plaster cross is adorned with regional motifs. These include a stepped pyramid representing Golgotha, the hill where Jesus is believed to have been crucified, sprouting leaves at the base, dots at the tips of the cross arms, and an arched niche design. According to archaeologist Maria Gajewska, who leads the excavation team, “Visually, every element of the plaster cross incorporates regional motifs… all find regional parallels in the Gulf and Mesopotamia.” Speaking to The National, Gajewska described the discovery as “an extremely exciting find” and a rare instance where archaeologists can clearly identify the community that once occupied a space. “We were just digging in the right place… Incredible,” she said.The story behind the find The cross was discovered face down in February 2025 by Hager Al Menhali, an Emirati archaeologist with DCT Abu Dhabi. “The plaster was resting face down and something about it caught my attention,” she told The National. “There was a distinct fingerprint on the back.” Thinking the print alone was significant, Al Menhali proposed registering the object as a special find. But when the team carefully turned it over, they were stunned to see a well-preserved cross. “This was one of the most significant discoveries of the season,” said Al Menhali. The discovery took place within a courtyard house to the north of the island’s main church and monastery site, an area that had not been explored in depth until this season. This zone is now considered to have been used by monks in retreat or seclusion. The surrounding buildings, some constructed with limestone and coral native to the island, feature thick walls and water cisterns, indications of a lifestyle more comfortable than one of strict asceticism. These features suggest the early Christian residents were not merely hermits but members of a larger, structured monastic community.Unearthing a rich and layered past Sir Bani Yas has long held archaeological significance. A Christian monastery dating back to the seventh or eighth century CE was first discovered there in 1992 by the Abu Dhabi Islands Archaeological Survey (ADIAS), under the UAE’s leadership. Since then, excavations have revealed a church and monastic complex believed to have operated simultaneously. Current interpretations suggest that while the monastery served as a broader communal religious site, individual monks would retreat to courtyard homes nearby for isolated contemplation. The recent discovery of the plaster cross provides strong evidence that Christianity was not confined to the monastery, but permeated other parts of the island community. At its peak, Christianity in the Arabian Peninsula thrived between the fourth and sixth centuries CE. Sir Bani Yas is part of a network of Christian sites that emerged during this period, with parallels found in Umm Al Quwain, Kuwait, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. Christianity on the island is believed to have coexisted with Islam until the eighth century CE, when the site was peacefully abandoned. Interestingly, the archaeological team has found no evidence of sudden destruction or conflict at the site. Instead, the clean and intact condition of the buildings suggests an intentional departure, possibly with the expectation of return. Additional finds from this season include pottery fragments and a sea-green glass bottle, likely used to hold oil or rosewater. These artefacts, along with others such as a stamp seal with a scorpion motif and glass chalices from earlier digs, are now on display at a small on-site exhibition.Preservation and the path ahead The Sir Bani Yas church and monastery are now sheltered and preserved, thanks to restoration works carried out by DCT Abu Dhabi in 2019. The site is open to the public, featuring improved signage and visitor facilities. A multi-faith church, inspired by the original structures, has also been constructed near the visitor centre to symbolise the values of unity and coexistence.Further excavation is planned at the courtyard houses, with the intention of integrating them into a larger cultural trail connecting significant sites across the island. Native wildlife, including Arabian gazelles and rock hyraxes, species known to inhabit the island since ancient times, are also part of the broader heritage landscape. DCT Abu Dhabi is conducting radiocarbon dating and in-depth analysis of the newly unearthed artefacts.Mohamed Khalifa Al Mubarak, Chairman of DCT Abu Dhabi, emphasised the wider significance of the discovery, linking it to the UAE’s enduring cultural values.“The discovery of this ancient Christian cross on Sir Bani Yas Island is a powerful testament to the UAE’s profound and enduring values of coexistence and cultural openness. It stirs within us a deep sense of pride and honour and reminds us that peaceful coexistence is not a modern construct, but a principle woven into the very fabric of our region’s history.”He also highlighted the long-term impact of archaeological work on the island and its relevance for future generations:“The ongoing discoveries from Sir Bani Yas Island, even after 30 years of research and excavation, underscore the magnitude of our cultural legacy and the importance of our continued commitment to its preservation and understanding… These discoveries deepen our connection to the past and inspire future generations to embrace the spirit of unity and mutual respect that has long defined our community.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Despite failing English and road sign tests, he obtained commercial driver's licenses in California and Washington. The incident has ignited a political clash between the Trump administration and California Governor Gavin Newsom over immigration and licensing policies, highlighting concerns about public safety.  Harjinder Singh, the Indian immigrant trucker, accused of killing 3 people in Florida after making a reckless U-turn on highway, badly flunked English fluency and road sign tests after the fatal crash, the US department of transportation said. He answered only two out of 12 questions correctly in English language proficiency test by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. Singh could only identify one out of four highway signs shown to him, the department of transportation (DOT) said.Despite these failures, he is belived to have entered America illegally in 2018 and was granted commercial driver's licenses (CDL) in California and Washington state.Sean Duffy, transportation secretary said, "This crash was a preventable tragedy directly caused by reckless decisions and compounded by despicable failures." PollDo you think stricter license and immigration checks could prevent tragedies like this?Yes, stricter checks are neededNo, current measures are sufficient"Non-enforcement and radical immigration policies have turned the trucking industry into a lawless frontier, resulting in unqualified foreign drivers improperly acquiring licenses to operate 40-ton vehicles," Duffy added. The Harjinder Singh controversy has become the latest point of tension between US President Donald Trump's administration and California governor Gavin Newsom.Singh, an Indian-origin truck driver, has been charged with three counts of vehicular homicide after he made a reckless U-turn on Florida Turnpike that led to a devastating collision of a minivan, killing three people. Singh has been living in US illegally since 2018 after crossing the Mexico border. The viral video has sent shockwaves, triggering criticism.Singh was arrested in California on Saturday by US marshals and is now facing deportation.Despite living illegally in US, Singh was issued a commercial driver's license by the California department of motor vehicles (DMV). Taking a jab at California governor, department of homeland security (DHS), in a post on X wrote, "How many more innocent people have to die before Gavin Newsom stops playing games with the safety of the American public?"It added that the department is working to free America from illegal aliens. Countering DHS, Newsom's press office in a post claimed that Singh entered US in 2018 when Trump was president and Newsom became the governor of California in 2019.After entering US, Singh was arrested by the Border Patrol and faced fast-track deportation, but he "claimed fear of going back to India." He was then released on a $5,000 immigration bond in January 2019 and was given a notice to appear.Since then, Singh has remained in immigration proceedings."The illegal alien is an Indian national who was granted a commercial driver's license by the so-called 'sanctuary state' of California, whose reckless policies put the lives of American citizens at risk every single day," said White House.It attacked Newsom further, saying that "instead of acknowledging the tragedy, criminal illegal alien sympathiser Gavin Newsom callously doubled down, claiming that giving driver's licenses to illegals 'improves public safety'."About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

In a video later shown on state television, the Russian official told Warren, "I have to say that this is a personal gift from the President of the Russian Federation."The heartwarming scenario unfolded on August 9 when Warren was out on his ancient Soviet-era motorcycle running errands when he was stopped by a Russian TV crew. After admiring his ride, the reporter asked him about the Putin-Trump meeting and the war's economic effects.Warren told the Anchorage Daily News that the numerous sanctions imposed on Russia had made it difficult and expensive to fix spare components for his bike because the new production facility was in Ukraine.Warren claimed that a few days later, he was called by the reporters to let him know that Putin had taken notice of the video after it went viral in Russia. At first, he thought their offer of a brand-new, $22,000 bike was a hoax, calling it "bats-t crazy," as reported by the New York Post.However, the handover was arranged by Russian embassy workers less than 24 hours after Putin and Trump met. According to the claim, Warren was seen on camera accepting the motorcycle and testing it out.It's day and night. Although I still enjoy my old one, this one is clearly superior. It's so amazing that I can't even speak. In the video, Warren remarked, "Thank you very much."Founded in 1941 in Soviet Russia, Ural is a motorcycle manufacturer with its headquarters located in the state of Washington. Following the crisis between Russia and Ukraine, the corporation moved its operations to Kazakhstan, according to the New York Post.This is the second instance in which the Russian side has publicly shown its nostalgia for the Soviet Union. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was spotted sporting a white sweatshirt bearing the Russian acronym for the USSR, "CCCP," the day before the Trump-Putin meeting in Alaska.After the meeting in Alaska, President Putin praised Trump's efforts to end the dispute. "The Ukrainian nation, and I have said it multiple times, is a brotherly nation; however strange it may sound in these conditions. We have the same roots, and everything that's happening is a tragedy for us.

The GOP argues this violates the state constitution's public review rule and undermines the independent redistricting commission. File photo: California Governor Gavin Newsom (Picture credit: AP) California Republicans have asked the state Supreme Court to block Governor Gavin Newsom’s redistricting plan, arguing Democrats are rushing legislation that could add five new Democratic congressional seats to counter Republican gains in Texas.The emergency petition, filed Monday by four Republican lawmakers, claims the plan violates the state constitution’s 30-day public review rule for new legislation. “Instead of a months-long transparent and participatory process overseen by an independent citizens redistricting commission … the public would be presented with an up-or-down vote on maps unilaterally prepared in secret by the Legislature,” the lawsuit said, according to The New York Times.Republicans want the court to pause the process until at least September 18 unless each legislative chamber secures a three-fourths vote to move faster, according to news agency Reuters. They also requested the court either rule on the merits by Wednesday or halt the process while the case is under review.Democratic leaders, who hold supermajorities in Sacramento, intend to pass three bills under what they have called the “Election Rigging Response Act” on Thursday to meet Newsom’s deadline for a November 4 special election. A spokesperson for the governor dismissed the challenge, saying: “Republicans are filing a deeply unserious (and truly laughable) lawsuit to stop Americans from voting? We’re neither surprised, nor worried,” as per Axios.The push is part of a broader national battle sparked when US President Donald Trump urged Texas Republicans to redraw maps mid-decade to secure five more GOP seats. Democrats in California are now pursuing a “tit-for-tat” strategy, according to Reuters, to offset Texas and preserve House control. Republicans currently hold a narrow 219-212 majority in the chamber.Critics say the move undermines California’s independent redistricting commission, created by voters in 2008 to ensure transparency. Democrats argue it is a temporary emergency measure to counter “extreme” gerrymandering efforts elsewhere.The lawsuit also highlights technical constitutional questions, including whether the 30-day clock begins when a bill number is assigned or only after the full text is introduced. California law also requires the final text of bills to be available 72 hours before any vote, a rule Democrats say they are observing with Thursday’s planned passage, The New York Times reported.The National Republican Congressional Committee has already signalled plans for further litigation.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Critics, including national security lawyer Mark Zaid, condemned the move as politically motivated and unlawful. Senator Mark Warner suggested it was a distraction from the Epstein documents. The revocations raise concerns about the U.S. File photo: Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard (Picture credit: AP) The Trump administration has stripped security clearances from 37 current and former national security officials, escalating its campaign against intelligence professionals it accuses of undermining the president’s agenda.A memo issued by director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Tuesday alleged that those affected had engaged in the “politicisation or weaponisation of intelligence,” mishandled classified material, or failed to maintain professional standards. However, the document did not provide evidence to support the claims.The move cut across multiple agencies, with both senior and mid-level figures targeted. The list included Shelby Pierson, a senior election-threat analyst; Vinh X. Nguyen, an NSA data scientist specialising in artificial intelligence and quantum computing; and a senior CIA analyst currently serving undercover.Critics condemned the revocations as politically motivated. “These are unlawful and unconstitutional decisions that deviate from well-settled, decades-old laws and policies,” said national security lawyer Mark Zaid, as quoted by AP, whose own clearance was revoked by the Trump administration. He called it hypocritical to accuse others of politicising intelligence while engaging in such actions.Gabbard defended the decision on social media, writing: “Being entrusted with a security clearance is a privilege, not a right. Those in the Intelligence Community who betray their oath … have broken the sacred trust they promised to uphold.” She confirmed the revocations were carried out under Trump’s direction.As per AP, the revocations form part of a broader push by the administration to revisit and discredit the 2017 intelligence assessment that concluded Russia interfered in the 2016 election in Trump’s favour. Multiple investigations have upheld those findings, noting both cyber intrusions and social media operations linked to Moscow.Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, criticised the action as “a reckless abuse of the clearance process” and suggested it was also an attempt to distract from the administration’s refusal to release documents linked to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.The consequences for current officials are immediate, with clearances tied to their jobs. For former officials, the impact is less clear, though some could face difficulties in private-sector work that requires access to classified material.This is not the first time Trump has wielded clearance revocations as a political tool. He has previously stripped access from former President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and more than four dozen ex-officials who signed a 2020 letter questioning the Hunter Biden laptop story. Several members of President Biden’s former national security team were also on the latest list.For some in the intelligence community, the loss of key personnel such as Nguyen raises concerns about the United States’ technological edge. According to The New York Times, former colleagues warned his removal could set back NSA projects in areas such as data science and cyber operations.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

In a statement posted on X, the prosecutor’s office confirmed that the heads belonged to 'men' but did not provide further details about the case. Bodies were discovered on Tuesday morning on a route linking Puebla and Tlaxcala, located just over 100 kilometers (62 miles) from Mexico City. Police did not confirm a motive for the killings or identify the criminal group behind the act. Local media, however, reported that a blanket was found at the scene carrying a message addressed to rival gangs and apparently signed by a group calling itself “La Barredora”, reported BBC. The prosecutor’s office in Tlaxcala said it had opened a formal investigation into the killings. Earlier this year, authorities in Sinaloa discovered 20 male bodies bearing gunshot wounds, including five that were decapitated, on a bridge over a federal highway.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Yosemite National Park: Ranger fired for hanging transgender pride flag on El Capitan
A Yosemite National Park ranger, Shannon “SJ” Joslin, was fired after helping hang a large transgender pride flag on El Capitan. This action, done in protest of Trump administration policies, led to stricter park rules on banners and flags. Two other rangers are under investigation, and the Justice Department is considering actions against those involved, sparking condemnation from advocates.

This action, done in protest of Trump administration policies, led to stricter park rules on banners and flags. Two other rangers are under investigation, and the Justice Department is considering actions against those involved, sparking condemnation from advocates. Ranger fired for hanging transgender pride flag on El Capitan A ranger at Yosemite National Park has been dismissed after helping drape a giant transgender pride flag across El Capitan, sparking a wider crackdown on protests at the California landmark.Shannon “SJ” Joslin, a 35-year-old ranger and biologist who studies bats, confirmed they were terminated last week after unfurling the 66-foot-wide flag on 20 May with a group of climbers. The flag, which remained for around two hours, was removed voluntarily. In a letter of dismissal, Yosemite’s acting deputy superintendent said Joslin had “failed to demonstrate acceptable conduct” in their role as a federal employee, reported The New York Times.Joslin, who identifies as nonbinary, was quoted as saying by news agency AP that she had acted out of personal conviction amid policies from the Trump administration that “target trans people.” She added, “I hung the flag as a way to tell myself we’re safe in national parks. Instead, this firing says the opposite, that federal workers who don’t align with this administration must stay silent or be eliminated.”Two other rangers who joined the action have been placed on administrative leave pending investigation, Joslin said. Park officials confirmed the justice department is considering administrative and possible criminal action against both employees and visitors involved. Violators could face fines of up to $5,000 and jail terms of six months.The Park Service tightened rules a day after the incident, banning flags or banners larger than 15 square feet in 94% of the park. “Displaying signs, banners and flags outside of designated First Amendment areas detracts from the visitor experience,” said spokesperson Rachel Pawlitz, as cited by AP.Yosemite, she added, must balance free expression with the protection of wilderness and visitor safety.Advocates have condemned the firing. Environmentalist and drag performer Pattie Gonia, who joined in hanging the flag, was quoted by AP as she called Joslin “a respected pillar within the Yosemite community.” Jayson O’Neill from Save Our Parks claimed the decision was meant to intimidate workers from speaking out, while Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility is now representing Joslin.Demonstrations at El Capitan have become more frequent. Earlier this year, protesters displayed an inverted US flag to criticise Trump-era cuts to the Park Service workforce. Since Trump took office, the service has lost about 2,500 employees, with a further $900 million cut proposed for next year, according to AP.For Joslin, Yosemite was more than a workplace. “Everything I did was off the clock and had nothing to do with my role,” she was quoted as saying by The New York Times. “Yosemite is my whole life”, she added.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

She had three children in four years. This was after a fraud conviction in 2020. Authorities discovered irregularities in her living arrangements. Her children were living with other family members. She is now serving her five-year sentence. . A Chinese woman who repeatedly became pregnant to avoid imprisonment has now been sentenced. Identified by the pseudonym Chen Hong, the woman received a five-year prison term for fraud in December 2020 in Shanxi province, local media reported, as cited by South China Morning Post.Chen repeatedly became pregnant, having three children with the same man over four years, reportedly in an attempt to avoid serving her prison sentence. When confronted with the evidence, she admitted she was already divorced.In China, inmates who are seriously ill, pregnant or nursing, or are unable to care for themselves may be temporarily allowed to serve their sentences outside prison.During this period, they are placed under community correction, either at hospitals or in their own homes, and are supervised by their local correctional institutions, typically run by prisons and public security authorities.The local prosecutors conduct regular inspections to oversee such arrangements. During one such inspection in May, officials found that Chen, who recently gave birth to her third child, was not living with her baby.They also discovered that the child’s household registration was listed under Chen’s sister-in-law, making the baby legally her sister-in-law’s child.Her first two children were living with her ex-husband, while her third child was living with his sister.With less than a year remaining on her sentence, Chen was returned to the detention center rather than a prison to serve the rest of her term.“I was more shocked that she could get pregnant when she wanted,” a social media user commented.“I pity the three children who were born only because their mother wanted to escape prison,” said another.Some prosecutors have proposed that in cases where convicts repeatedly become pregnant, the legal system should suspend their sentence instead of continuing to count prison time.“This approach would also help protect the rights of their unborn children,” prosecutors from Yancheng in Jiangsu province wrote in an article, as cited by South China Morning Post.This is not the first case of its kind. A Chinese woman reportedly evaded prison for a decade by becoming pregnant 13 times. The woman, who was 29 at the time, was convicted of corruption and sentenced to life in prison in 2005a, as reported by People’s Daily Online.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Kennedy Jr. has rolled out the “Pete and Bobby Challenge”, pairing up with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth as part of the Trump administration’s nationwide “Make America Healthy Again” campaign. Kennedy and Pete Hegseth squared off in a fitness contest that involved completing 50 pull-ups and 100 pushups in under five minutes at the Pentagon. The challenge was unveiled through a video first shared with Fox News Digital. The initiative is aimed at encouraging Americans to swap “fat” for “fit.” “I teamed up with @SecDef Hegseth for the ‘Pete & Bobby Challenge’ — 50 pull-ups, 100 push-ups. This is the start of a nationwide push to get Americans fit again,” Kennedy wrote on X. The contest saw both leaders push their limits, with Hegseth finishing just over the five-minute mark, emerging as the winner in the challenge.Secretary Kennedy also invited Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy to take part in the next round of the challenge.Pete Hegseth in a post on X thanked President Donald Trump for his efforts to make Americans fit again. "President Trump set the example by putting forth efforts to make America healthy again. That’s why we are introducing the Pete and Bobby challenge. 100 push-ups. 50 pull-ups. 10 minutes." The effort tied into the broader health push by the Trump administration. Kennedy advocated for whole foods over processed meals, while Hegseth linked the campaign to ensuring the US military remained among the fittest and best-prepared forces in the world. At the youth level, President Donald Trump reinstated the Presidential Fitness Test and the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition, which had been retired under former President Barack Obama in favor of the Presidential Youth Fitness Program. By executive order signed in July, Trump directed the council to launch school-based programs that reward excellence in physical education and to design a Presidential Fitness Award.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Despite last-minute appeals citing brain damage and racial bias, the courts rejected them. Bates' execution is part of a nationwide trend, with 29 executions carried out this year, the highest in a decade. File photo: Kayle Barrington Bates and Janet Renee White (Picture credit: AP, X) Florida on Tuesday carried out its record 10th execution of the year, putting to death Kayle Barrington Bates, who was convicted of abducting and murdering insurance worker Janet Renee White in 1982.Bates, 67, received a lethal injection at Florida State Prison near Starke and was pronounced dead at 6:17 pm (local time), according to the state’s department of corrections. Governor Ron DeSantis had signed the death warrant last month. Witnesses said Bates declined to make a final statement and refused a last meal. As per news agency AP, he was strapped to a gurney, and the execution began at 6:01 pm (local time). He was unresponsive within minutes and declared dead shortly after.White’s husband, Randy White, who witnessed the execution, described it as long-awaited justice. “I made a promise to her right after it happened that I would be there for every trial, every hearing, every appeal, and that as long as I was living, I would seek justice for her,” he was quoted as saying by USA Today. “I feel a relief that I can mentally let Renee know that justice has finally been served for her, and that’s mentally what I need. It’s always been for her.”Court records show Bates abducted White from her State Farm office in Lynn Haven, dragged her into nearby woods, attempted to sexually assault her, stabbed her to death and stole her wedding ring. He was arrested shortly afterwards, covered in blood, with the ring in his pocket.Bates’ lawyers had filed last-minute appeals, including claims of organic brain damage and racial bias in Florida’s use of the death penalty, but the Florida Supreme Court and the US Supreme Court rejected them. A federal lawsuit accusing DeSantis of discrimination in signing death warrants was also dismissed.Veterans’ groups had urged the governor to spare Bates because of his service in the Florida National Guard, but DeSantis maintained he was signing warrants for “the worst of the worst.” A spokeswoman said the execution was based solely on his crimes, not his military status.Since the US Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, Florida’s highest previous annual total was eight executions in 2014. With Tuesday’s execution, the state has now surpassed that record, and two more executions are scheduled: Curtis Windom on 28 August and David Pittman on 17 September.Nationwide, Bates’ execution marked the 29th this year, the highest in a decade. At least nine more are scheduled before the end of 2025, according to AP.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The new account, @whitehouse, went live on Tuesday evening with an inaugural video featuring footage of Trump declaring: “I am your voice.” The clip was captioned, “America we are BACK! What’s up TikTok?” and had drawn about 4,500 followers within an hour of posting. The debut came against the backdrop of uncertainty over TikTok’s future in the US. A federal law mandating the app’s sale or a nationwide ban on national security grounds had been scheduled to take effect on January 20, the day before Trump’s inauguration. However, the Republican president, who leaned heavily on social media during his 2024 campaign and has often expressed fondness for TikTok, paused the ban. TikTok, owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, remains under scrutiny. In April, the company confirmed it had been in talks with the US government to seek a resolution and noted that any agreement “will be subject to approval under Chinese law,” the Guardian reported. In June, Trump extended the deadline for the third time, granting the video-sharing platform an additional 90 days to secure a non-Chinese buyer or face a ban in the country. The extension is set to expire in mid-September.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

US eyes Budapest for Trump-Putin-Zelenskyy meet; Russia signals gradual approach
The White House is reportedly considering Budapest for a high-stakes trilateral meeting between Presidents Trump, Putin, and Zelenskyy. While the US Secret Service prepares in Hungary, Moscow prefers Russia as the venue, and France suggested Geneva. This follows Trump's Alaska meeting with Putin, with discussions ongoing regarding security guarantees for Ukraine and potential peacekeeping missions, despite Russian officials slowing progress.

File photo: Russian President Vladimir Putin, US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy (Picture credit: AP) The White House is considering Budapest as the potential venue for a high-stakes trilateral meeting between US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, according to a Trump administration official and a person familiar with the discussions.According to Politico, the US Secret Service has begun preparations in Hungary, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, a long-time ally of Trump. However, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to confirm details, saying, “I’m not going to confirm or deny locations.” While Moscow has pushed for the talks to take place in Russia and French President Emmanuel Macron has suggested Geneva, Budapest has emerged as the frontrunner, Politico noted. Switzerland also offered itself as a host, with its foreign minister promising “immunity” to Putin despite an outstanding war crimes warrant.Hungary’s selection would be sensitive for Kyiv, recalling the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, under which the US, UK and Russia guaranteed Ukraine’s sovereignty in exchange for it giving up nuclear weapons, a pledge undermined by Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea.Despite ongoing uncertainty, momentum has built following Trump’s recent Alaska meeting with Putin. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said a bilateral between Putin and Zelenskyy could happen within weeks, with Trump later announcing he would join them in a trilateral format as a “final step.” Russian officials, however, are said to be slowing progress. Foreign minister Sergey Lavrov told state television Moscow favoured talks that proceed “step by step, gradually.”At Tuesday’s briefing, Leavitt confirmed that “President Trump spoke with President Putin by phone, and he agreed to begin the next phase of the peace process, a meeting between President Putin and President Zelenskyy, which would be followed, if necessary, by a trilateral meeting between President Putin, President Zelenskyy and President Trump.” As per Fox News, she added that Vice President JD Vance, secretary of state Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff were coordinating efforts to make the bilateral happen “as soon as possible.”The update came a day after Zelenskyy and several European leaders met Trump at the White House to discuss next steps. Leaders praised Trump’s role, with Finnish President Alexander Stubb remarking, “In the past two weeks, we’ve probably had more progress in ending this war than we have in the past three-and-a-half years.” UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer echoed the view, saying that for years “nobody has been able to bring it to this point.” Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte added, “Without President Trump, this deadlock with Putin would not have been broken.”According to Politico, Nato defence chiefs and senior military leaders from the US, UK, Germany, France, Finland and Italy are holding parallel talks in Washington on possible security guarantees for Ukraine, including discussions over a peacekeeping mission and additional American arms.Putin, meanwhile, used his joint press conference with Trump in Alaska to endorse Trump’s long-standing claim about the origins of the war, saying, “I can confirm that” Russia would not have invaded Ukraine if Trump had been re-elected in 2020.As questions continue about long-term security guarantees for Ukraine beyond Trump’s current term, Leavitt said the president “understands the need” and is discussing future commitments with Nato and European partners.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
