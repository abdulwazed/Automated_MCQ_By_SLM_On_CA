Curiously, neither Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli appear in the latest ODI Rankings, issued by ICC - cricket's global body. In the latest update, August 19, neither of India's ex-captains find a spot in the top-10 rankings.In last week's update, Rohit was in the No. 2 spot with 756 points while Kohli stood in the fourth place with 736 points. Now, Shubman Gill is the leading batter in ODI rankings with 784 rating points and Shreyas Iyer in sixth on 704 points. The other Indian in the top-20 places is KL Rahul in 13th with 638 points.Asia Cup 2025: India Squad Announced | Surya Named Captain, Gill Vice-CaptainIncidentally, Babar Azam, who had slipped to third in last week's rankings with Rohit taking over the second place, has now moved back beneath Gill.Latest ICC ODI Rankings, updated on August 19. (Image: ICC)Neither Rohit or Kohli have played any cricket since IPL 2025 while their last appearance in India's colours came in March in the Champions Trophy final against New Zealand.Do players disappear from the ICC Rankings?Yes. As per ICC's rules on rankings, a player can be removed from the top-100 spots if they've not played a match within the qualifying period - 12-15 months for Tests and 9-12 months for ODIs and T20Is.Alternatively, a player can be removed from the rankings for good if they retire from a format or completely from international cricket. ICC, in its rulebook, explains that when MS Dhoni retired from Tests in 2014, he was removed from the Test rankings, but remained in the ODI rankings.This is why Kohli and Rohit are not presented in the latest Test and T20I rankings considering they've bowed out from both formats. Both retired from the shortest format after winning the 2024 T20 World Cup and from Tests in May this year.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
