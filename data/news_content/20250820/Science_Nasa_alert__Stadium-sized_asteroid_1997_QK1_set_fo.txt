ISRO plans future missions to study near-Earth asteroids. International collaboration is key for planetary defense.  Asteroids have long fascinated scientists and the public alike, serving as reminders of both the beauty and unpredictability of our universe. These rocky remnants from the solar system’s formation often pass through Earth’s neighborhood, sometimes sparking excitement and curiosity when they come unusually close. While most of these flybys are harmless, they provide valuable opportunities for researchers to study asteroid behavior, refine orbital models, and improve planetary defense systems. NASA, along with other global space agencies, closely monitors such events to ensure Earth’s safety and to expand our understanding of near-Earth objects. One such asteroid making headlines now is 1997 QK1, a massive space rock expected to pass Earth on August 20, 2025, during a safe but significant flyby.NASA confirms asteroid 1997 QK1 will pass Earth on August 20: Size and distanceAsteroid 1997 QK1 was first detected in the late 1990s and has been tracked ever since. It belongs to the Aten group of near-Earth asteroids, named after the Egyptian sun god Aten. These asteroids are unique because their orbits cross Earth’s path around the Sun, making them frequent candidates for close encounters. This asteroid’s large size makes it particularly notable. To put its dimensions into perspective:It is longer than three football fields lined up. If it ever struck Earth, it could cause regional devastation, though not global extinction like the asteroid linked to the dinosaurs’ demise.Fortunately, its trajectory ensures it will remain safely distant during this flyby.On August 20, the asteroid will pass within 1.87 million miles (3 million kilometers) of Earth. While this may sound vast, in astronomical terms it qualifies as a close approach. For comparison:The Moon orbits Earth at about 238,855 miles (384,400 km).This asteroid will pass roughly eight times farther than the Moon’s distance.Though distant in human terms, space agencies classify such encounters as significant because they allow researchers to refine orbital predictions and study asteroid behavior more closely.Why Asteroid 1997 QK1 is not a threatAsteroids are classified as Potentially Hazardous Objects (PHOs) if they meet two conditions:They are larger than 140 meters (460 feet).They come within 4.6 million miles (7.4 million km) of Earth.Asteroid 1997 QK1 meets both criteria, but “potentially hazardous” does not mean “imminently dangerous.” Instead, it signals that its path deserves careful tracking and monitoring by astronomers worldwide. NASA’s precise calculations confirm that this flyby is safe, with no risk of impact now or in the near future, and continuous observations ensure early warning of any unexpected trajectory changes.Why NASA and global space agencies track asteroidsAsteroid monitoring is a cornerstone of planetary defense. Even small changes in an asteroid’s orbit—caused by gravitational nudges from planets or effects like the Yarkovsky effect (when sunlight heats one side of an asteroid, slowly altering its trajectory)—can shift its long-term path.By observing asteroids like 1997 QK1, scientists aim to:Improve orbital models to predict future movements.Assess their composition, density, and spin rate.Explore strategies for deflection missions if a dangerous asteroid is discovered in the future.Notably, NASA’s DART mission (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) in 2022 demonstrated the possibility of altering an asteroid’s orbit by deliberately crashing a spacecraft into it—an important milestone in planetary defense.India’s ISRO plans future missions to study near-Earth asteroidsThe interest in asteroids is not limited to NASA. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has outlined plans for participation in global asteroid studies. According to ISRO Chairman S. Somanath, future missions may include research on larger near-Earth objects, especially as the world prepares for the highly anticipated close approach of asteroid Apophis in 2029.International collaborations involving NASA, ESA (European Space Agency), and JAXA (Japan) are essential, as planetary defense requires shared data and joint strategies. By pooling resources and expertise, space agencies ensure Earth is better prepared for cosmic encounters.Why asteroid 1997 QK1’s flyby is a scientific opportunity for NASA and ISROThe flyby of 1997 QK1 is more than a cosmic spectacle—it is a scientific opportunity. Studying such objects helps researchers uncover:Clues about the solar system’s formation, since asteroids are primitive building blocks of planets.Insights into their structural integrity, important for future resource mining or deflection missions.Better risk assessment models, ensuring preparedness for genuine threats.Although harmless, this event underscores the importance of constant vigilance. The universe is filled with millions of space rocks, and only careful monitoring can separate harmless visitors from those that could alter life on Earth.Also Read | NASA intern Thad Roberts stole $21 million in moon rocks from Johnson Space Center for love; shocked the worldAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.
