Bollywood and cricket are two worlds that capture the hearts of millions, not just in India but across the globe. With glamour on one side and sports stardom on the other, it’s no surprise that rumours of romances often make headlines. From dinner dates to spotted outings, the public is always curious to know if a Bollywood actress is secretly seeing a cricket star. Some rumours are quickly dismissed, while others linger for years. Let’s take a closer look at the actresses who were linked to cricketers.Sara Ali Khan and Shubman GillSara Ali Khan sparks dating buzz after gurudwara visit with rumoured beau Arjun BajwaRumours of a relationship between Sara Ali Khan and cricketer Shubman Gill began when they were spotted together on a dinner date. However, Sara addressed the speculation on 'Koffee With Karan' Season 8. With humour, she said, “You have got the wrong Sara, guys. Sara ka sara duniya galat Sara ke peechay pada hai.” This may have been a reference to Sara Tendulkar, daughter of cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar, who was also rumoured to be dating the young cricketer.Nidhhi Agerwal and KL RahulNidhhi Agerwal, who works in Telugu, Tamil and Hindi films, was rumoured to be dating cricketer KL Rahul after they were seen together several times. Both made it clear they were only friends. KL Rahul had told NDTV, “I have known her for a long time, we both come from the same city. It's great to see the progress she is making in her field. We have known each other even when I was a cricketer and she was a Bollywood actress. It was not just me and her hanging out, there were three or four more people from Bangalore. It's good to catch up with friends and I assure you there is nothing happening.” KL Rahul is now married to actress Athiya Shetty, and the couple welcomed daughter Evaarah earlier this yearPollShould celebrities openly address relationship rumors more often?Yes, it avoids misunderstandingsNo, personal life should stay privateIzabelle Leite and Virat KohliBrazilian model and actress Izabelle Leite seen in movies like ‘Talaash’ reportedly dated cricketer Virat Kohli for almost two years. She had told Bollywood Hungama, “Virat was one of the first Indian friends I had when I came to India. We were dating for quite a while. We were together for almost two years. But we didn't want to make it public. So yeah, Virat and I did have a relationship. But Sidharth is only my friend and yes, we do spend time together as well.”Deepika Padukone and Yuvraj SinghBack in time, Deepika Padukone and cricketer Yuvraj Singh were seen together on dinner dates, leading to dating rumours. As quoted by Telegraph India, Yuvraj explained, “I had just come back from South Africa and we met through common friends in Mumbai. We liked each other and wanted to know more.” However, their busy schedules prevented a long-term relationship.He added, “We didn’t spend enough time with each other to know if it was going to be a long-term thing. As things turned out she moved on and so did I. Well, she was with me and now she's moved on with another person. I guess it's her personal choice. If someone wants to move out of a relationship, there isn't much that the other person can do. I am not blaming anyone but just stating the facts.”Sushmita Sen and Wasim AkramSushmita Sen and Pakistani cricketer Wasim Akram were judging the reality show 'Ek Khiladi Ek Haseena' in 2008. Their closeness sparked rumours of a relationship, as they were seen together on multiple occasions. Sushmita later cleared the air on social media, “Hi guys! Been reading about my upcoming wedding with Wasim... ABSOLUTE RUBBISH!!! Goes to show just how irresponsible media can be sometimes! Wasim Akram is a friend and will always be one!! He has a wonderful lady in his life... rumours like these are uncalled for n disrespectful! My beautiful people..when I find 'THE ONE'...you'll be the first to know :)) benefits of being my twitter family!! ;) love u all soooooo much.”Amrita Singh and Ravi ShastriBack in the 1980s, Amrita Singh and cricketer Ravi Shastri were rumoured to be dating. Amrita was often seen cheering for Ravi from the stands. However, the relationship ended, and both went on to marry other people, Amrita tied the knot with Saif Ali Khan and Ravi married Ritu Singh. In a throwback video Ravi had recalled a shy first meeting with Amrita, “When I first met my girlfriend, Amrita, you might know her from films, it was at a restaurant in Mumbai. For the first ten minutes, I didn't say a word. I always knew I was shy around girls, but I didn't expect to be completely speechless. She kept talking for the entire ten minutes. It was one of my most embarrassing moments.”"Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
