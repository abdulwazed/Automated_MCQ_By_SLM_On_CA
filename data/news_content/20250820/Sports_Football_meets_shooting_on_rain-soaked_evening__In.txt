Football meets shooting on rain-soaked evening in Subroto Cup (Special Arrangements)  NEW DELHI: Under ominous black clouds casting their spell over Delhi’s skyline, the Subroto Cup, India's oldest national school football tournament, roared to life with its 64th edition at the Ambedkar Stadium on Tuesday. Despite heavy rain in the morning hours of the day, leaving carpets soaked and the turf damp, hundreds of students and army officers in the stands cheered on to undo the damage dealt by the weather. Olympian and Arjuna Award-winning shooter Anjum Moudgil, the guest of honour for the opening ceremony, drew an exciting comparison between team sports like football and something deeply individual like shooting. While shooting remains less accessible compared to team sports like football in India, she said that individual sports are more lucrative than playing for a team.

When you win a medal, obviously you get more attention than a team,” she told TimesofIndia.com on the sidelines of the Subroto Cup.The words of the former world number one in 50m 3 position rifle come at a time when Indian shooters are riding a wave of success. Manu Bhaker set the tone at the Paris 2024 Olympics with two bronze medals, while Suruchi Singh, Arya Borse, Arjun Babuta, Sift Kaur Samra and Elavenil Valarivan all made their mark at the ISSF World Cup of late. On Tuesday, Bhaker added another bronze at the Asian Shooting Championships in Kazakhstan. On the pitch, however, the first match of the tournament lived up to its billing.
