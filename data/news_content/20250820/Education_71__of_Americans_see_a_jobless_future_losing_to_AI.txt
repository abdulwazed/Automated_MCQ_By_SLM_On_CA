The survey highlights anxieties about AI's impact beyond employment. People are worried about political stability and military risks. There are concerns about energy consumption and human relationships. Education is a key battleground in the AI debate. Gen Z faces an uncertain job market.  The American workforce may be staring at its biggest disruption since the Industrial Revolution. A new Reuters/Ipsos poll has revealed that 71% of Americans believe artificial intelligence (AI) will cause “too many people to be permanently unemployed,” fueling fears that the technology could erase jobs faster than it creates them.The poll, conducted over six days and released on August 19, 2025, surveyed 4,446 adults and carries a margin of error of two percentage points. Its findings show widespread concern that AI is not merely another workplace tool but a force that could fundamentally reshape careers, industries, and even the social fabric of the country.For Gen Z—students and young professionals entering the job market—the implications are stark. They may be stepping into the most uncertain employment landscape in decades.Low unemployment, high anxietyOfficial numbers suggest stability. The US unemployment rate was 4.2% in July, a relatively low figure by historical standards. Yet the Reuters/Ipsos poll shows a growing perception gap: even as jobs exist today, Americans fear the long-term erosion of work opportunities due to AI.Unlike earlier waves of automation that primarily affected manufacturing and manual labor, AI threatens knowledge work—jobs in law, journalism, customer service, finance, and even medicine. These are the careers many Gen Z students are currently training for.“People are not just worried about layoffs,” Reuters reported. “They are worried that the work itself could vanish.”Democracy, security, and the human costThe survey also revealed anxieties that stretch far beyond the job market:Political Stability: 77% of Americans are worried about AI destabilising politics. One flashpoint was an AI-generated video showing former President Barack Obama being “arrested” by Donald Trump. Though fake, the clip spread widely online, underscoring the potential of AI to blur the line between truth and manipulation in an election year.Military Risks: Nearly half of respondents (48%) oppose the use of AI to determine military targets. Only 24% supported such deployment, reflecting discomfort with machines making life-and-death decisions.Energy Demands: 61% expressed concern over the energy consumption of AI systems, which require vast computing power and could exacerbate climate challenges.Human Relationships: Two-thirds of Americans worry people might begin to prioritize AI “companions” over real human connections. With AI chatbots and virtual partners already on the market, this fear no longer belongs solely to the realm of science fiction.These concerns highlight AI’s disruptive potential not just as an economic force but as a societal disruptor.Education in the crosshairsEducation is emerging as a key battleground in the AI debate. According to the Reuters/Ipsos poll:40% believe AI will harm learning outcomes,36% think it will improve education, and24% remain undecided.This split mirrors the uncertainty faced by students who wonder if their degrees will still hold value in a job market reshaped by algorithms. Gen Z graduates, many of whom already juggle student debt, are asking whether they are preparing for roles that could soon be automated out of existence.The Gen Z dilemmaFor Gen Z, the AI question is not abstract—it’s deeply personal. This generation is already grappling with rising housing costs, inflation, and gig-based employment structures. Now, they must also consider whether AI will undercut their chances at stable, long-term careers.Some experts argue that history offers hope. Just as the internet revolution created industries that were unimaginable in the 1990s, AI could give rise to new roles—from AI ethics officers to digital trust managers and climate-tech innovators.But as the Reuters report makes clear, most Americans aren’t convinced that new opportunities will outweigh the losses. The specter of permanent unemployment looms larger than the promise of new industries.The road aheadWhat does this mean for policymakers, educators, and employers? The Reuters/Ipsos poll suggests three urgent takeaways:Job Security Must Be Redefined: Traditional “safe” careers may no longer be immune to disruption, and governments will need to rethink retraining programs and social safety nets.Education Needs a Reset: Universities and schools must adapt curricula to emphasize creativity, critical thinking, and adaptability—skills less likely to be replaced by machines.Trust and Ethics Matter: With public fears extending to democracy, relationships, and even warfare, responsible AI development is no longer optional—it’s essential.Ready to navigate global policies?
