In a statement posted on X, the prosecutor’s office confirmed that the heads belonged to 'men' but did not provide further details about the case. Bodies were discovered on Tuesday morning on a route linking Puebla and Tlaxcala, located just over 100 kilometers (62 miles) from Mexico City. Police did not confirm a motive for the killings or identify the criminal group behind the act. Local media, however, reported that a blanket was found at the scene carrying a message addressed to rival gangs and apparently signed by a group calling itself “La Barredora”, reported BBC. The prosecutor’s office in Tlaxcala said it had opened a formal investigation into the killings. Earlier this year, authorities in Sinaloa discovered 20 male bodies bearing gunshot wounds, including five that were decapitated, on a bridge over a federal highway.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
