Mohit Suri's romantic musical drama, 'Saiyaara,' starring Ahaan Panday and Anette Padda, has grossed Rs 325.11 crore in 33 days. Despite competition from 'Coolie' and 'War 2,' the film sustained footfalls, driven by positive word-of-mouth and repeat viewings, especially among younger audiences. Cinema chains have re-added shows due to continued demand. 'Saiyaara' has become the 14th biggest hit in Hindi cinema. Mohit Suri’s Saiyaara, starring Ahaan Panday and Anette Padda, has crossed yet another milestone at the box office. The romantic musical drama has now collected Rs 325.11 crore in 33 days. The film has added Rs 2.51crore to its collection since the release of Rajinikanth’s Coolie and Hrithik Roshan-Jr NTR starrer War 2 which accounted for most screens across the country.The film opened to a steady start on Day 1 with Rs 21.5 crore, followed by strong weekday hold and an impressive weekend surge, peaking at Rs 35.75 crore on its third day. By the end of its first week the film had collected Rs 172.75 crore, Week 2 stood at Rs 107.75 crore, Week 3 was at 28.25 crore and in Week 4 the film collected Rs 14.1 crore and after counting six days of week 5, the film’s total collection now stands at RS 325.11 crore. Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda’s chemistry steals the show at 'Saiyaara' success bashWhile facing tough competition from Coolie and War 2 and with least number of shows in its journey the film maintained a steady inflow of footfalls. Word of mouth and repeat viewing, especially among younger audiences who connected with its music and tender love story, kept the numbers ticking. As soon as the weekend rush for Coolie and War 2 began to stabilize, cinema chains across the country took note of the sustained demand for Saiyaara. This week, several multiplexes and even single-screen theatres have re-added shows for the film to cater to its growing popularity.This renewed demand comes at a crucial juncture. On Day 33, Saiyaara added Rs31 lakhs to its tally, pushing the film past the coveted Rs 325 crore benchmark. The film has already become the 14th biggest hit of Hindi Cinema but it seems unlikely the film will be able to make it to the 13th rank as that is taken by Salman Khan’s Tiger Zinda Hai with Rs 339.16 crore collection.
