The outfit, designed by Ukrainian designer Viktor Anisimov, featured a black suit with a subtle black vent, a detail that brought it closer to civilian wear while maintaining the wartime aesthetic Zelenskyy has favored throughout the conflict."These are our hopes for peace," Anisimov was quoted as saying by Reuters. "We think that if we add something subtle to this image, something from civilian clothing to his uniform, then it will be like a lucky charm.”Trump praised Zelenskyy’s less formal suit as he arrived at the White House for talks on Monday, on the Russia-Ukraine war, a notable shift from their tense February meeting. Earlier this year, however, an American journalist had questioned Zelenskyy’s choice of attire during his meeting with Trump and US Vice President JD Vance.Anisimov, 61, from Ukraine’s northern Chernihiv region, said that while watching videos of the exchange, he felt the remarks were directed not only at Zelenskyy but at the Ukrainian people as a whole. "There was a slight sense of despair because they do not understand how we breathe, how we live," Anisimov said as quoted by Reuters.Zelenskyy has worn Anisimov’s designs at key moments, including the funeral of Pope Francis in April and the NATO Summit in June."I can't say that we sewed (a suit) specifically for the NATO summit or for an important conversation with Trump and European leaders. The suit is just a suit," Anisimov said. He added that Zelenskyy has about five similar-looking jackets with only small tweaks.The White House reporter, Brian Glenn, who had asked Zelenskyy in February why he was not wearing a suit, praised his outfit choice on Monday, saying, "you look fabulous in that suit".Anisimov said he was not focused on criticism or compliments this time, but on making sure the Ukrainian president appeared dignified. "They praise, they scold. If we win, and we will win, then whose suit it was doesn't matter," he said“We had already started working on the president’s new wardrobe and style in January. After what happened in February, knowing our president’s principles, I thought that he would not want to change his style. But no, he decided that we should continue,” Anisimov was quoted as saying by Womenswear Daily.“It’s not about the suit, it’s about what happens to Ukraine,” Anisimov added.This was not the first time Anisimov had been tasked with reshaping the president’s style. Back in the early 2000s, when Zelenskyy was still a comedian, Anisimov helped design the Ukrainian president's and his crew’s wardrobe. Zelenskyy pledged in 2022 that he would not return to wearing a suit and tie or shaving his beard until Ukraine achieves victory in the war, as per the Financial Times.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
