Silopi, a city in the Sirnak province, is located around 10 kilometres from the Iraq and Syrian borders. It shattered the previous national high of 49.5 C recorded in August 2023 in the western province of Eskisehir. Turkey has faced weeks of scorching heat along with several wildfires. Fourteen people lost their lives battling blazes last month in the western part of the country. Hundreds of people were evacuated on Friday in the northwest province of Canakkale, where the busy Dardanelles Strait was closed to maritime traffic due to two raging fires. The heatwave has also prompted fears of water shortages in some areas. The resort town of Cesme on the Aegean Sea has restricted tap water for residents and tourists between 11:00 pm to 6:00 am since July 25.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksGlobal Standard indexUS stocks todayIndia-US tariffIntel CEOMukesh AmbaniUS jobless dataRussia crude oilTop TrendingTyreek HillSelena GomezKim KardashianTaylor SwiftTravis KelceBill Belichicks GirlfriendNBA Trade RumorsDwyane WadesShannon SharpeMike VrabelTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteTyreek Hill, ex Keeta Vaccaro rush baby Capri to ER;
