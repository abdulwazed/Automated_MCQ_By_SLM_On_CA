They are engaged in legal battles across several states. Wyoming and Utah saw judges halt voucher programs due to constitutional concerns. Similar lawsuits are progressing in Montana and Missouri. The South Carolina Supreme Court initially ruled against a voucher program. The fight highlights the debate over public versus private education.  Teachers unions across the United States are waging a series of high-stakes legal fights against private school voucher programs, and in some states, they’re winning. At least five lawsuits have been filed since 2022, when the US Supreme Court’s Carson v. Makin ruling allowed public funding to flow to private, including religious, schools.According to The 74, the challenges led primarily by teachers unions in Wyoming, Utah, Montana, Missouri, and South Carolina, have already produced two significant victories. Judges in both Wyoming and Utah have halted voucher programs, citing constitutional concerns.Judges side with educators in Wyoming and UtahIn July, the Wyoming Education Association secured an injunction blocking the state’s newly expanded universal voucher plan. District Court Judge Peter Froelicher ruled that the $30 million Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act, which offers families $7,000 in state-funded scholarships, cannot proceed until its constitutionality is decided.Union president Kim Ame told The 74 that lawmakers went too far by removing income caps: “Our constitution clearly says that we cannot give public money to private entities, so that’s why we challenged that.” The state has appealed to the Wyoming Supreme Court.Utah saw a similar outcome earlier this year, when a judge struck down the $100 million Utah Fits All Scholarship Program. The Utah Education Association argued that the initiative diverted taxpayer dollars to private schools not required to admit all students or operate under state supervision. The case is now headed to the Utah Supreme Court.More lawsuits move through the courtsUnions in other states are pursuing parallel claims. In Montana, the state’s largest public employees union joined litigation targeting a voucher program for students with disabilities, arguing in a legal brief that such initiatives strip children of essential protections guaranteed in public schools.Missouri’s MOScholars program has also come under fire. Initially launched as a tax-credit scholarship in 2021, it was expanded this year with $50 million in direct taxpayer funding. The Missouri National Education Association sued in June, alleging that lawmakers “constructed out of whole cloth a scheme to divert general revenues” to private tuition. Pro-school choice groups, including EdChoice Legal Advocates, have since intervened in defense of the program.In South Carolina, the state Supreme Court ruled in 2024 that its Education Trust Fund Scholarship Program was unconstitutional. Lawmakers have since revived it by diverting funds from the state lottery rather than the general budget, a workaround noted by The 74.A growing national showdownThe push-and-pull reflects a broader struggle over the future of American education. As The 74 has reported, more than 30 states now operate some form of private school choice. Advocates say vouchers give families critical flexibility; unions counter that they weaken public schools and run afoul of constitutional provisions requiring a uniform system of education.With appeals pending in Utah and Wyoming, and new cases advancing in Montana and Missouri, 2025 is shaping up to be a decisive year. The outcomes could determine not just the legality of state voucher programs, but the balance of power between public school systems and school choice advocates nationwide.Ready to navigate global policies?
