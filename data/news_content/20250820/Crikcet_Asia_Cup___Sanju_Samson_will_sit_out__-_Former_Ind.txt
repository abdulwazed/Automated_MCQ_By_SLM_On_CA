Sanju Samson (X) Former India batter Aakash Chopra believes Shubman Gill’s return to the side has all but ended Sanju Samson’s chances of finding a place in the playing XI for the Asia Cup in the UAE. “India seems to be moving in the direction of an all-format captain. With Shubman Gill’s return, Sanju Samson’s fate has more or less been sealed. He will not feature in the playing XI now. You will not drop Tilak Varma or Hardik Pandya, which means Samson sits out and Jitesh Sharma will likely get the nod again. One thing is very clear from this selection, the batting slots have been prioritised over personalities. With Gill coming in as vice-captain, he will definitely play and open the batting. This essentially pushes Sanju Samson out of the XI,” Chopra said on JioHotstar.India Asia Cup squad press conference: What Ajit Agarkar, Surya said on shocking callsGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! The announcement of Gill as vice-captain has once again placed a question mark over Samson’s future in T20 internationals. Samson has been included in the squad, but Gill’s return has raised doubts about whether the Kerala batter will make the playing XI. The speculation has grown stronger after chief selector Ajit Agarkar read out the names in a particular order. Gill and Jitesh Sharma were mentioned first, while Samson and Rinku Singh were named towards the end. Many see this as an indication that Gill will open alongside Abhishek Sharma, while Jitesh may take the gloves and bat in the finisher’s role. With Tilak Varma, Suryakumar Yadav, Shivam Dube, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel expected to fill the middle-order positions, Samson’s opportunities look limited. Jitesh could also be preferred over Rinku Singh as a late-order pinch-hitter. Agarkar, however, played down the debate, saying the final XI would be decided by the captain and coach once the team reaches Dubai. “The captain-coach will take the call on the best balance for the team. Once we get to Dubai, we will have a bit more clarity. With more options available now, Shubman has been in great form for the last few months. So has Sanju, so two good options, along with Abhishek,” Agarkar said.PollWhich player seems most likely to take the gloves in the Asia Cup?Sanju SamsonJitesh Sharma Skipper Suryakumar Yadav added weight to Jitesh Sharma’s case, praising his transformation as a batter over the past year. “Post the last T20 World Cup, we spoke a lot on how to go about it. We said let’s not think of milestones ahead, follow your journey. He has been a completely different cricketer post that. The way he performed in the IPL and domestic tournaments, he has earned his spot again,” Surya said. The captain also defended the selection of pacer Harshit Rana, highlighting his consistency. “He has played really well in the IPL. In Pune, he came in as a concussion replacement and was Man of the Match in the last game he played for India. We back his skills, we know he can deliver,” Surya added. With both the chief selector and captain offering different signals, Samson faces another nervous wait. For now, his inclusion in the squad is not under question, but his place in the XI looks increasingly uncertain.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
