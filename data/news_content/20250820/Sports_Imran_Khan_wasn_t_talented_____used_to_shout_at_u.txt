Wasim Akram and Imran Khan  NEW DELHI: Pakistan pace legend Wasim Akram has opened up on what it was like to play under Imran Khan, calling the 1992 World Cup-winning skipper the greatest captain he ever played with. Akram, who began his international career in the mid-1980s, credited Imran for shaping him not only as a cricketer but also as a professional.Reflecting on his early days with Pakistan, Akram said much of his development came under Imran’s guidance. Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"I think whatever I did as a cricketer, off the field, on the field, credit goes to him. He used to give us a lot of confidence. He led from the front. He had a belief in his own ability. He was a hardworking cricketer," Akram said on Stick to Cricket.While many considered Imran a naturally gifted player, Akram stressed that his success was built on relentless effort. "People used to say I'm very naturally talented. Skipper wasn't talented. He worked hard. Remember he changed his bowling action. From 76, exactly. Changing even a little bit of action can take months, it might not happen. But he did change his action. He was so determined," Akram said.Akram emphasised that Imran’s determination and willingness to reinvent himself set an example for the entire team. His hard work, according to Akram, created a culture where no one could afford to be complacent. "I mean he was the best captain I played under. He used to give confidence to every one of us," Akram noted.PollWho do you believe is the greatest cricket captain in history?Imran KhanKapil DevSteve WaughClive LloydAt the same time, Imran was known to be tough on his players when required. Akram explained that the former skipper demanded full commitment on the field. "At times he used to shout at us because if you were lazy, fair enough. He was tough, but he was tough on the field. You give your 100%. If you don’t do well, he was okay with it," he said.However, Imran could not tolerate players who tried to shield themselves in pressure situations. "If you're trying to save yourself and say okay, it's a pressure situation, I’ll just take a back seat — he used to judge. He knew this particular player is just saving himself. So that used to annoy him a lot," Akram revealed.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
