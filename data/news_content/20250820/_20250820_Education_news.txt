SC directs UP govt to regularise 6 daily-wage employees, slams decades of ‘exploitative ad-hocism’
The Supreme Court has ordered the Uttar Pradesh government to regularise six daily-wage Class-IV employees serving since the 1990s, slamming decades of “exploitative ad-hocism.” A Bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta held that financial constraints cannot justify denial of regularisation, directing creation of posts, arrears payment, recalculated pensions, and dues for retirees and deceased employees’ families.

New Delhi, India: The Supreme Court has ordered the Uttar Pradesh government to regularise six daily-wage Class-IV employees who had been serving in the state higher education services commission since the early 1990s.Coming down heavily on the state for decades of exploitative “ad-hocism,” a Bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta quashed a government order that had denied sanction for permanent posts citing financial hardships.The Bench held that the plea of financial constraints could not justify the prolonged denial of regularisation. “The State is not a mere market participant but a constitutional employer. It cannot balance budgets on the backs of those who perform the most basic and recurring public functions,” the court observed.Rejecting the state’s justification, the court said that a generic plea of “financial constraints,” ignoring functional necessity and decades of reliance on daily wagers to discharge regular duties, fell short of the reasonableness expected from a model public institution.It clarified that the present judgment does not contradict its earlier rulings against regularisation of irregular appointments, since the case involved the State’s arbitrary refusal to sanction posts despite its acknowledged need and long-standing dependence on the petitioners’ services.The apex court directed the Uttar Pradesh government and the U.P. Education Services Selection Commission to regularise the petitioners with effect from April 24, 2002, by creating supernumerary posts if necessary.It also ordered payment of arrears of pay and allowances, recalculated pensions for retirees, and settlement of terminal dues for the families of deceased employees.“The long-term extraction of regular labour under temporary labels corrodes confidence in public administration and offends the promise of equal protection,” the Bench observed.

7 ways students can retain more in less time: The case for ending cramming sessions
In 2025, cramming is losing relevance as research highlights smarter learning methods for lasting retention. Techniques like spaced repetition, microlearning, active recall, and interleaving outperform last-minute study. Consistent habits, optimized environments, sleep, and nutrition further boost memory. By replacing cramming with evidence-based strategies, students can learn faster, retain more, and achieve long-term academic success.

Techniques like spaced repetition, microlearning, active recall, and interleaving outperform last-minute study. Consistent habits, optimized environments, sleep, and nutrition further boost memory. By replacing cramming with evidence-based strategies, students can learn faster, retain more, and achieve long-term academic success.  In 2025, the academic landscape is evolving rapidly. With the proliferation of digital tools, changing attention spans, and an ever-growing volume of information, students face unprecedented challenges in retaining knowledge. Traditional cramming sessions, once deemed effective, are now under scrutiny. Emerging research and modern study techniques suggest that smarter, more deliberate approaches yield better long-term retention.Embrace spaced repetition Spaced repetition involves reviewing information at increasing intervals over time. This technique leverages the brain's natural memory processes, enhancing long-term retention. Tools like Quizlet have popularized this method, allowing students to efficiently review material. Studies confirm that spaced repetition significantly outperforms cramming in retaining.Incorporate microlearning Microlearning refers to consuming information in short, focused bursts. This approach aligns with the brain's capacity to process and retain small chunks of information. By dedicating just five minutes to a topic during daily routines, students can effectively reinforce learning without feeling overwhelmed.Utilize active recall Active recall involves actively retrieving information from memory rather than passively reviewing notes. Techniques like self-quizzing and teaching others are effective methods of active recall. This practice strengthens neural connections, making information more accessible in the future.Engage in interleaved practice Interleaving involves mixing different topics or subjects during study sessions. This approach contrasts with the traditional method of focusing on one topic at a time. Interleaving enhances problem-solving skills and helps students apply knowledge more flexibly. Maintain consistent study habits Establishing a regular study schedule is crucial. Consistency helps reinforce learning and prevents the need for last-minute cramming. Techniques like the Pomodoro method, which involves studying for 25 minutes followed by a 5-minute break, can enhance focus and productivity. Optimize the study environment A conducive study environment minimizes distractions and enhances concentration. Students should aim for a quiet, well-lit space and consider using tools like website blockers to maintain focus. Additionally, incorporating physical activity, such as short walks, can boost cognitive function and memory retention.Prioritize sleep and nutrition Adequate sleep and proper nutrition are foundational to cognitive function. Sleep consolidates memories, and a balanced diet provides the necessary nutrients for brain health. Students should aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night and maintain a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and omega-3 fatty acids.The downside of cramming Cramming may offer short-term benefits, but it often leads to superficial understanding and rapid forgetting. Research indicates that information learned through cramming is less likely to be retained long-term compared to information learned through spaced repetition and active engagement.  In the fast-paced academic environment of 2025, students must adapt to more effective study strategies. By embracing techniques like spaced repetition, microlearning, and active recall, students can enhance retention and comprehension. Moving away from traditional cramming sessions in favor of these evidence-based methods will lead to more meaningful and lasting learning experiences.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

These modules detail the mission launched in response to the Pahalgam terror attack, showcasing India's military capabilities and the unity displayed across the nation. It highlights technological advancements and diplomatic achievements, emphasizing the importance of standing against terrorism. File photo The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has launched two specially designed modules on Operation Sindoor for students of classes 3 to 12, aiming to bring lessons of courage, strategy, and national pride straight into the classroom. Far more than a military story, these modules frame Operation Sindoor as a promise to protect peace and honour the lives lost during the Pahalgam terror attack, as reported by PTI.According to ANI, the modules are being introduced as supplementary curriculum material, featuring maps of precision strikes, images of downed Pakistani drones, and Made-in-India defence systems. Written in a conversational style between teachers and students, they make complex military events accessible and engaging for young learnersI.Modules tailored for different stagesThe modules designed by NCERT are as follows:Classes 3 to 8: “Operation Sindoor — A Saga of Valour” focuses on courage, empathy, and the human side of the mission.Classes 9 to 12: “Operation Sindoor — A Mission of Honour and Bravery” provides a deeper look at strategic objectives, technological advances, and India’s military prowess.According to PTI, the modules explain that although Pakistan denied involvement in the Pahalgam attack, it was carried out on “direct orders by Pakistan’s military and political leadership.” On April 22, 2025, terrorists from The Resistance Front (TRF), a known proxy of Lashkar-e-Taiba, opened fire on tourists in Baisaran Valley, killing 26 people, including a Nepali citizen.Lessons from the pastStudents are introduced to earlier events to provide context:The Pulwama attack in February 2019, which killed 40 CRPF personnel.The Balakot airstrikes later that month, in which Mirage 2000 jets destroyed a Jaish-e-Mohammed training camp.The abrogation of Article 370, which brought peace, infrastructure development, improved schools, and increased tourism to Jammu and Kashmir. ANI notes that Pakistan was reportedly unsettled by these changes.Operation Sindoor: A precise and coordinated missionLaunched on May 7, 2025, at 1:05 am, Operation Sindoor targeted nine terror bases in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, including the key hubs of Muridke and Bahawalpur. In just 22 minutes, the Indian Army and Air Force neutralized the camps using Rafale and Su-30MKI jets, BrahMos missiles, drones, and ISRO satellite surveillance, PTI reports.Despite Pakistan’s retaliatory attempts using drones, artillery, and missiles, India’s multi-layered air defence system, including S-400 and Akash, prevented any damage to critical assets or civilian areas. The Navy asserted maritime dominance in the Arabian Sea, and the Border Security Force successfully foiled infiltration attempts.National unity and solidarityThe modules emphasise how India stood together in the wake of the attack. Candlelight marches were held nationwide, Muslim communities in Hyderabad, Lucknow, and Bhopal wore black armbands in protest, and border villages demanded strong action in support of the Armed Forces. In Kashmir, shopkeepers closed their shops to protest, and local communities actively denounced terrorism, breaking stereotypes and highlighting the voice of peace-loving citizens.The operation’s name, Sindoor, was chosen to honour the widows of the victims, symbolizing empathy, solidarity, and respect. Prime Minister Modi described it as a tribute that underscores both national courage and personal compassion.Technology, diplomacy, and national prideThe modules spotlight India’s technological self-reliance, showcasing indigenous jets, missiles, drones, and satellites. These modules also highlight how the operation demonstrated the effectiveness of the Make in India defence push, combining innovation with precision. Diplomatically, the modules also note that India successfully persuaded the US to officially declare TRF a foreign terrorist organisation in July 2025, PTI reports.Summing up, NCERT describes Operation Sindoor as “a military success, a technological breakthrough, and a political message all rolled into one—a triumph of bravery, strategy, and innovation,” as reported by ANI. By bringing this story into classrooms, NCERT hopes to inspire students with lessons of courage, unity, and patriotism, while also raising awareness about India’s defence capabilities and the importance of standing up against terrorism.Ready to navigate global policies?

Himachal Pradesh HC restores teacher’s curtailed maternity leave, terms salary recovery ‘impermissible’
The Himachal Pradesh High Court has quashed state orders curtailing a teacher’s maternity leave and initiating salary recovery. Justice Sandeep Sharma held that Kamini Sharma, a JBT, was entitled to her full 180-day leave sanctioned in 2021 despite her regularisation. The Court termed the recovery “wholly impermissible” and directed the government to release pending benefits within four weeks.

Justice Sandeep Sharma held that Kamini Sharma, a JBT, was entitled to her full 180-day leave sanctioned in 2021 despite her regularisation. The Court termed the recovery “wholly impermissible” and directed the government to release pending benefits within four weeks.  Shimla, Himachal Pradesh, India: The Himachal Pradesh High Court has come to the aid of a government school teacher whose maternity leave was curtailed midway after her regularisation, ruling that the state could not deny her the full benefit of leave already sanctioned.Justice Sandeep Sharma, in a detailed judgment delivered on August 11, 2025, allowed the petition filed by Kamini Sharma, a Junior Basic Teacher (JBT), and quashed the government’s orders dated December 13, 2021, December 23, 2021, and June 19, 2025.The Court noted that Sharma, who had given birth on August 21, 2021, was granted 180 days of maternity leave. However, after her services were regularised on October 21, 2021, she was compelled to rejoin duty the very next day by furnishing a medical fitness certificate.Subsequently, the education department cancelled her sanctioned leave, treated her absence as “extraordinary leave,” and even initiated recovery of salary.“The submission of Medical Fitness Certificate at the time of regularisation, in peculiar facts and circumstances as detailed hereinabove, could not have given any right to the respondents to curtail the maternity leave of the petitioner granted to her w.e.f. 21.8.2021, for a period of 180 days,” Justice Sharma observed.The judge also criticised the state’s conduct in proceeding with recovery despite an interim stay granted by the High Court on January 13, 2022. “Despite the said order, respondents have proceeded to order recovery from the petitioner vide order dated 19.6.2025, which is wholly impermissible,” the ruling said.Holding that the petitioner was entitled to complete her maternity leave until February 2022, the Court directed the government to release all due benefits within four weeks, failing which interest at 6% per annum would be payable from the date the amount fell due.

A viral message circulating on social media was dismissed as misinformation. While the IMD has issued an orange alert for Mumbai, a red alert has been declared for Raigad.  The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has dismissed as fake a message circulating on social media claiming that schools and colleges in the city and suburbs would remain closed on Wednesday, August 20, due to a 'red' alert for heavy rainfall.In an official statement shared on X, the civic body said, “This message is fake. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has not issued any such information through its official social media platforms.”Fake closure notice goes viralThe BMC also released an image of the forged message, which had been designed to look like an announcement from its verified handle and was widely shared on WhatsApp groups and other social media platforms. The fake post stated that all government, private, and municipal schools and colleges in Mumbai would be shut on August 20.Orange alert for Mumbai, red alert for RaigadAccording to the civic body, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an orange alert for Mumbai, predicting heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated locations across the city, Thane, and Palghar on August 20.A red alert, however, has been issued for neighbouring Raigad district, where heavy to very heavy showers are expected at some places.The BMC urged citizens not to believe in unverified messages and to rely only on its official communication channels for updates.(with PTI inputs) TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

It is located in New York City. The program is expensive. Undergraduates may pay around $95,000 yearly. Masters students spend about $95,422 annually. Costs include tuition, living, and health insurance. Financial aid is available. Columbia offers access to Wall Street and global firms. Many students find the investment worthwhile for career prospects.  For thousands of students worldwide, Columbia University remains a dream destination to study Economics. Situated in the heart of New York City, Columbia offers one of the most sought-after Economics programs in the Ivy League. But behind the prestige comes a steep price tag. For the 2025 academic year, tuition, fees, and living expenses combine to make it one of the most expensive education investments globally.The undergraduate costAn undergraduate degree in Economics at Columbia comes with an annual tuition and fee structure ranging from $68,000 to $71,170. On top of this, students spend about $17,000 to $18,680 on housing and meals. Columbia also requires all students to purchase health insurance, priced at around $4,955 annually. Books and personal expenses add another $4,000.Taken together, the total cost for one year of undergraduate study lies between $90,000 and $95,000. Over a standard four-year program, this can amount to nearly $380,000, not including the yearly increments that universities typically introduce.Cost of master’s in economicsFor students pursuing a master’s in Economics, the financial demands remain equally high. Tuition alone is pegged at $67,320 for the year. Living in New York City—whether on or off campus—adds close to $21,897. Mandatory health insurance contributes $4,955, while books and supplies bring in an additional $1,250.That brings the total annual cost to approximately $95,422. With most MA programs running for two years, graduates can expect to spend close to $190,000 in total.The hidden expensesThe official numbers only tell part of the story. Costs at Columbia rise incrementally every year, meaning students should be prepared for annual hikes in both tuition and housing. For international students, the financial burden is heavier still, with visa fees, airfare, and potential insurance top-ups adding to the overall bill. Living in New York City can also be more expensive than the university’s estimates, particularly for those opting for off-campus housing.Can students get financial aid?Columbia’s undergraduate students benefit from need-based financial aid, and the university is known to meet 100 percent of demonstrated financial need for admitted students. For graduate students, the options are fewer but include competitive fellowships, teaching assistantships, and research assistantships. While these can ease the financial load, they are not guaranteed, especially for international applicants.Why students still choose ColumbiaDespite the daunting costs, Columbia University continues to draw students from across the world. Its Economics program is consistently ranked among the best, with faculty expertise spanning everything from global finance to development economics. Its location in New York offers unparalleled access to Wall Street, multinational firms, the United Nations, and leading policy think tanks—making it a unique launchpad for careers in economics, finance, and policymaking.The takeawayStudying Economics at Columbia University in 2025 is a six-figure annual investment, with undergraduates paying up to $95,000 per year and graduate students spending around $95,422. For many, this investment is justified by Columbia’s academic reputation, global networking opportunities, and the career pathways it opens. For aspiring economists, the challenge is not only gaining admission but also ensuring they can meet the significant financial commitment.Ready to navigate global policies?

Skipping grades, graduating college at 14, and interning at Intel and Blackbird.AI, Quazi’s journey blends academic brilliance with industry impact. His move underscores Wall Street’s growing competition with AI labs and tech giants for top talent.  Elon Musk’s youngest hire, Kairan Quazi, is trading rockets for trading algorithms. At just 16, the Bangladeshi-American prodigy has left SpaceX’s Starlink division after two years to join Citadel Securities in New York City as a developer. The move marks his entry into one of Wall Street’s most competitive arenas, where engineering talent is increasingly being courted by finance giants vying with AI labs and Big Tech for the brightest minds.“I felt ready to take on new challenges and expand my skill set into a different high-performance environment,” Quazi told Business Insider in an exclusive interview.But how did a teenager manage to leap from middle school to Wall Street in less than a decade?A childhood marked by accelerationQuazi’s journey has been anything but conventional. Skipping from third grade directly to college at age nine, he enrolled at Las Positas College, where he graduated with highest honors in mathematics at just 11. By 14, he had already become the youngest graduate in Santa Clara University’s 170-year history, completing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering cum laude, alongside graduate-level coursework in advanced algorithms, NLP, and data mining.During his undergraduate years, he combined academic rigor with teaching responsibilities, serving as a college tutor in calculus, statistics, and chemistry — an unusual role reversal for someone barely in his teens.From research labs to rocket scienceEven before completing his degree, Quazi built an impressive portfolio of research and industry experience. At age 10, he became the first undergraduate intern at Intel Labs’ Human AI group, working on predictive speech generation platforms — a stint that stretched over three and a half years. He also delivered keynote addresses at the Linux Foundation North America Summit and SHIFT AI Global Conference.In 2022, he joined the cyber-intelligence startup Blackbird.AI as a machine learning intern, developing pipelines to detect disinformation threats across social media. But it was his leap to SpaceX in 2023 that placed him on a global stage.As a software engineer at Starlink, Quazi worked on network beam planning and optimization, designing production-critical systems that determine how satellites target internet beams worldwide. “It required a deep understanding of low-latency, high-performance computing and real-time programming,” his LinkedIn profile notes.Why Wall Street over AI labsGiven his track record, Quazi had no shortage of offers from leading AI labs and technology firms. But he chose Citadel Securities for its blend of intellectual complexity and speed. “Quant finance offers a pretty rare combination: the complexity and intellectual challenge that AI research also provides, but with a much faster pace,” he explained to Business Insider. “At Citadel Securities, I’ll be able to see measurable impact in days, not months or years.”The firm’s meritocratic approach also appealed to him. Unlike many institutions that might hesitate at his age, Citadel evaluated him solely on skill.Life beyond algorithmsMoving to Manhattan represents more than just a career pivot. For the first time, Quazi will live independently, walking to work instead of relying on his mother to drive him to SpaceX’s Redmond office — a reminder that despite his resume, he is still a teenager navigating milestones most reach much later.Lessons from Quazi’s pathFor students and educators, Quazi’s story is not just one of precocity but of possibility. His journey highlights how alternative educational pathways — early college, project-based learning, and industry immersion — can cultivate talent far earlier than traditional timelines allow.As Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and AI labs compete for minds like his, the deeper lesson is clear: The future belongs to those willing to blur the boundaries between age, discipline, and convention.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

The survey highlights anxieties about AI's impact beyond employment. People are worried about political stability and military risks. There are concerns about energy consumption and human relationships. Education is a key battleground in the AI debate. Gen Z faces an uncertain job market.  The American workforce may be staring at its biggest disruption since the Industrial Revolution. A new Reuters/Ipsos poll has revealed that 71% of Americans believe artificial intelligence (AI) will cause “too many people to be permanently unemployed,” fueling fears that the technology could erase jobs faster than it creates them.The poll, conducted over six days and released on August 19, 2025, surveyed 4,446 adults and carries a margin of error of two percentage points. Its findings show widespread concern that AI is not merely another workplace tool but a force that could fundamentally reshape careers, industries, and even the social fabric of the country.For Gen Z—students and young professionals entering the job market—the implications are stark. They may be stepping into the most uncertain employment landscape in decades.Low unemployment, high anxietyOfficial numbers suggest stability. The US unemployment rate was 4.2% in July, a relatively low figure by historical standards. Yet the Reuters/Ipsos poll shows a growing perception gap: even as jobs exist today, Americans fear the long-term erosion of work opportunities due to AI.Unlike earlier waves of automation that primarily affected manufacturing and manual labor, AI threatens knowledge work—jobs in law, journalism, customer service, finance, and even medicine. These are the careers many Gen Z students are currently training for.“People are not just worried about layoffs,” Reuters reported. “They are worried that the work itself could vanish.”Democracy, security, and the human costThe survey also revealed anxieties that stretch far beyond the job market:Political Stability: 77% of Americans are worried about AI destabilising politics. One flashpoint was an AI-generated video showing former President Barack Obama being “arrested” by Donald Trump. Though fake, the clip spread widely online, underscoring the potential of AI to blur the line between truth and manipulation in an election year.Military Risks: Nearly half of respondents (48%) oppose the use of AI to determine military targets. Only 24% supported such deployment, reflecting discomfort with machines making life-and-death decisions.Energy Demands: 61% expressed concern over the energy consumption of AI systems, which require vast computing power and could exacerbate climate challenges.Human Relationships: Two-thirds of Americans worry people might begin to prioritize AI “companions” over real human connections. With AI chatbots and virtual partners already on the market, this fear no longer belongs solely to the realm of science fiction.These concerns highlight AI’s disruptive potential not just as an economic force but as a societal disruptor.Education in the crosshairsEducation is emerging as a key battleground in the AI debate. According to the Reuters/Ipsos poll:40% believe AI will harm learning outcomes,36% think it will improve education, and24% remain undecided.This split mirrors the uncertainty faced by students who wonder if their degrees will still hold value in a job market reshaped by algorithms. Gen Z graduates, many of whom already juggle student debt, are asking whether they are preparing for roles that could soon be automated out of existence.The Gen Z dilemmaFor Gen Z, the AI question is not abstract—it’s deeply personal. This generation is already grappling with rising housing costs, inflation, and gig-based employment structures. Now, they must also consider whether AI will undercut their chances at stable, long-term careers.Some experts argue that history offers hope. Just as the internet revolution created industries that were unimaginable in the 1990s, AI could give rise to new roles—from AI ethics officers to digital trust managers and climate-tech innovators.But as the Reuters report makes clear, most Americans aren’t convinced that new opportunities will outweigh the losses. The specter of permanent unemployment looms larger than the promise of new industries.The road aheadWhat does this mean for policymakers, educators, and employers? The Reuters/Ipsos poll suggests three urgent takeaways:Job Security Must Be Redefined: Traditional “safe” careers may no longer be immune to disruption, and governments will need to rethink retraining programs and social safety nets.Education Needs a Reset: Universities and schools must adapt curricula to emphasize creativity, critical thinking, and adaptability—skills less likely to be replaced by machines.Trust and Ethics Matter: With public fears extending to democracy, relationships, and even warfare, responsible AI development is no longer optional—it’s essential.Ready to navigate global policies?

From the Vice President’s office in Washington to the House of Representatives across multiple states, Indian-origin leaders are making history in the United States. As of 2025, at least eight Indian-Americans hold influential positions in US politics, bringing with them diverse professional expertise, cultural identity, and a strong grounding in education.Their academic backgrounds span medicine, law, engineering, economics, and business—fields that continue to resonate with Indian families worldwide. For these politicians, universities were not just stepping stones but launchpads for careers that now shape US domestic and foreign policy.Kamala HarrisThe daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, Kamala Harris made history as America’s first woman and first Indian-origin Vice President. Harris studied economics and political science at Howard University, one of the most prestigious historically Black colleges, before earning her law degree at UC Hastings College of Law. Her legal training laid the foundation for her career as California’s Attorney General and later as US Senator, before rising to the nation’s second-highest office.Ami BeraA practicing physician before entering politics, Dr. Ami Bera represents California’s 6th District.

Starting with a BS in Chemistry at Karnatak University and an MS at the University of Mumbai, he went on to pursue a PhD in Chemistry at the University of Akron. Thanedar later became a successful entrepreneur before entering politics, showing how scientific training can translate into business and public service.Suhas SubramanyamAt 39, Suhas Subramanyam represents a younger generation of Indian-American politicians.

Why parents are losing faith in US public schools even as most oppose shutting down the Education Department
Public confidence in U.S. schools is falling as parents turn towards private and alternative education models, fueled by declining enrollment, school choice expansion, and pandemic-era shifts. Yet, most Americans oppose shutting down the Education Department, highlighting a paradox: Families want more options but still value public education. Consolidations, closures, and redesigns loom as districts face mounting pressure.

Yet, most Americans oppose shutting down the Education Department, highlighting a paradox: Families want more options but still value public education. Consolidations, closures, and redesigns loom as districts face mounting pressure.  Public opinion on U.S. schools is undergoing a noticeable shift. Rising school choice options, shrinking enrollment pools, and pandemic-era pivots toward alternative models have left many parents questioning the future of public education.According to the 57th annual PDK Poll released Tuesday, nearly 60% of parents now say they support using public funds for their child to attend a private or religious school — up from 50% in 2007. At the same time, confidence in public schools has fallen sharply, with only 43% of respondents grading their community schools an A or B in 2025, compared to 53% in 2013.Yet despite waning support for the public school system, a majority of Americans remain resistant to dismantling it altogether. The poll found that 66% oppose or strongly oppose closing the U.S. Department of Education, a long-standing goal of the Trump administration. Just 22% backed its closure.Expanding school choice, shrinking enrollmentThe growing preference for alternatives to public education comes as school districts confront declining birth rates, shrinking enrollment pools, and expanded competition from private and choice-based models.Congress in July approved the first federal private school choice tax credit under President Donald Trump’s “Big, Beautiful” budget law, a move that could make private schooling options more accessible nationwide. According to K-12 DIVE, Researchers also point to the COVID-19 pandemic as a turning point, with many parents turning to homeschooling, micro-schools, or alternative education models — a shift that shows signs of persisting even if its momentum has slowed.Enrollment declines are already forcing difficult decisions. The Austin Independent School District in Texas is weighing school consolidations after losing over 10,000 students in the past decade, with potential closures as early as the 2026–27 academic year. Atlanta Public Schools has also begun studying consolidation and merger plans, while in July, St. Louis Public Schools proposed shuttering 37 of its 68 schools over the next two years, according to K-12 DIVE.What else the poll revealsBeyond attitudes towards funding and enrollment, the PDK Poll highlighted other trends shaping education debates:AI in classrooms: 68% of respondents opposed providing student data to artificial intelligence software for grading or assessment. Public support for AI tools in lesson planning and teaching fell between 2024 and 2025.Diversity initiatives: 61% of adults said diversity, inclusion, and equity efforts are very or somewhat important in schools.Cellphones in class: A striking 86% favored some form of cellphone restriction during the school day.Teacher pay: While still high, concern about low teacher salaries dipped slightly — 64% of respondents in 2025 said pay is too low, down from 66% in 2018.A system under pressureThe findings underscore the paradox facing U.S. education: While parents increasingly explore private or alternative schooling options, they are not ready to abandon public education as an institution. Two-thirds of Americans believe closing the Education Department would harm public schooling, according to the poll.But as demographic shifts reduce student populations and alternative models gain ground, districts across the country face a stark reality — one where consolidations, closures, or redesigns may become the new normal.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

They are engaged in legal battles across several states. Wyoming and Utah saw judges halt voucher programs due to constitutional concerns. Similar lawsuits are progressing in Montana and Missouri. The South Carolina Supreme Court initially ruled against a voucher program. The fight highlights the debate over public versus private education.  Teachers unions across the United States are waging a series of high-stakes legal fights against private school voucher programs, and in some states, they’re winning. At least five lawsuits have been filed since 2022, when the US Supreme Court’s Carson v. Makin ruling allowed public funding to flow to private, including religious, schools.According to The 74, the challenges led primarily by teachers unions in Wyoming, Utah, Montana, Missouri, and South Carolina, have already produced two significant victories. Judges in both Wyoming and Utah have halted voucher programs, citing constitutional concerns.Judges side with educators in Wyoming and UtahIn July, the Wyoming Education Association secured an injunction blocking the state’s newly expanded universal voucher plan. District Court Judge Peter Froelicher ruled that the $30 million Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act, which offers families $7,000 in state-funded scholarships, cannot proceed until its constitutionality is decided.Union president Kim Ame told The 74 that lawmakers went too far by removing income caps: “Our constitution clearly says that we cannot give public money to private entities, so that’s why we challenged that.” The state has appealed to the Wyoming Supreme Court.Utah saw a similar outcome earlier this year, when a judge struck down the $100 million Utah Fits All Scholarship Program. The Utah Education Association argued that the initiative diverted taxpayer dollars to private schools not required to admit all students or operate under state supervision. The case is now headed to the Utah Supreme Court.More lawsuits move through the courtsUnions in other states are pursuing parallel claims. In Montana, the state’s largest public employees union joined litigation targeting a voucher program for students with disabilities, arguing in a legal brief that such initiatives strip children of essential protections guaranteed in public schools.Missouri’s MOScholars program has also come under fire. Initially launched as a tax-credit scholarship in 2021, it was expanded this year with $50 million in direct taxpayer funding. The Missouri National Education Association sued in June, alleging that lawmakers “constructed out of whole cloth a scheme to divert general revenues” to private tuition. Pro-school choice groups, including EdChoice Legal Advocates, have since intervened in defense of the program.In South Carolina, the state Supreme Court ruled in 2024 that its Education Trust Fund Scholarship Program was unconstitutional. Lawmakers have since revived it by diverting funds from the state lottery rather than the general budget, a workaround noted by The 74.A growing national showdownThe push-and-pull reflects a broader struggle over the future of American education. As The 74 has reported, more than 30 states now operate some form of private school choice. Advocates say vouchers give families critical flexibility; unions counter that they weaken public schools and run afoul of constitutional provisions requiring a uniform system of education.With appeals pending in Utah and Wyoming, and new cases advancing in Montana and Missouri, 2025 is shaping up to be a decisive year. The outcomes could determine not just the legality of state voucher programs, but the balance of power between public school systems and school choice advocates nationwide.Ready to navigate global policies?

Touring Dove Science Academy and joining Gov. Kevin Stitt, she framed deregulation as key to Trump’s agenda. Supporters see flexibility; critics warn it risks widening inequities and weakening accountability.  U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon’s visit to Oklahoma on Tuesday offered a glimpse into how the Trump administration plans to rewire America’s public school system: By dismantling federal oversight and returning control to the states.At the heart of the conversation was a proposal to replace statewide standardized testing with locally chosen assessments, a plan advanced by Oklahoma Superintendent Ryan Walters. While McMahon acknowledged the idea had “not gone through all the different steps” for approval, she signaled openness to rethinking the decades-old system that ties federal funding to uniform student exams.“We want to give them the most flexibility that we can give them to operate within their state,” McMahon said while speaking with reporters at the state Capitol.A tour with political undertonesMcMahon’s schedule underscored the political theater surrounding education policy. She appeared alongside Gov. Kevin Stitt and former House Speaker Charles McCall, now running for governor, but not with Walters — despite his vocal support for the Trump administration. The absence reflected a deepening rift between Oklahoma’s top education officials, who have sparred publicly for months.Her tour of Dove Science Academy, a high-performing charter school in Warr Acres, doubled as a showcase for the administration’s vision. Students flew drones, coded robots, and even programmed a robot dog to shake McMahon’s hand. That same day, U.S. News & World Report ranked the academy as the third-best high school in Oklahoma.Later, she joined Stitt at the Capitol as he signed a bill banning diversity, equity, and inclusion programs from higher education institutions — a priority that mirrors the Trump administration’s broader agenda.Cutting Washington down to sizeMcMahon’s trip is part of her 50-state “Returning Education to the States Tour,” a campaign launched after the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for mass downsizing at the Department of Education. President Trump has tasked McMahon with nothing less than dismantling the agency itself.The administration’s proposal envisions funneling federal dollars into large block grants, giving states discretion over spending. In theory, it would free schools from the maze of compliance paperwork that governors like Stitt argue drains resources. But any major restructuring would require congressional approval, where questions of accountability and equity loom large.Oklahoma’s paradoxStitt pointed to his state’s recent moves to expand charter funding, offer tax credits for private-school families, and boost overall education spending as evidence of progress. Yet national assessments still rank Oklahoma near the bottom in student outcomes, exposing the tension between expanding choice and improving academic performance.McMahon avoided commenting directly on whether she trusts Walters’s leadership, even as his department faces persistent turmoil. Instead, she emphasized flexibility and deregulation as the north stars of federal policy.The bigger pictureThe debate in Oklahoma captures a larger national moment: the push to redefine what role, if any, Washington should play in American classrooms. By sidelining standardized tests and federal regulations, the Trump administration is seeking to place the burden, and opportunity, squarely on states.For supporters, it is a long-overdue chance to strip away bureaucracy and focus on students. For critics, it risks deepening inequalities between districts and undermining efforts to measure progress on a common scale.What is clear is that McMahon’s tour is not just symbolic. It is a preview of the classroom battles ahead, where the fight is less about robots and rankings and more about who gets to decide what education looks like in the 21st century.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

Federal judge blocks Mississippi’s ban on ‘divisive concepts’ in classrooms, fuelling national fight over DEI and academic freedom
A federal judge has blocked key parts of Mississippi's new law restricting DEI practices in public schools, citing First Amendment concerns. The injunction halts enforcement of sections banning 'divisive concepts' related to race, sex, and gender identity. While some provisions remain, the ruling allows educators to continue discussing contested issues, potentially influencing similar legal challenges nationwide.

The injunction halts enforcement of sections banning 'divisive concepts' related to race, sex, and gender identity. While some provisions remain, the ruling allows educators to continue discussing contested issues, potentially influencing similar legal challenges nationwide.  A federal judge has blocked major portions of Mississippi’s new law restricting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices in public schools, issuing a ruling that sharply questioned the statute’s constitutionality.US District Judge Henry Wingate granted a preliminary injunction on Monday, pausing enforcement of sections that ban schools from teaching so-called “divisive concepts” related to race, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or national origin. His order also blocks restrictions on DEI programs, courses, offices, and required diversity training, according to the Associated Press.Law still partially in effectThe injunction does not block other provisions of the law, including those prohibiting preferential treatment based on race, sex, or national origin and provisions penalising schools if staff or students refuse to adopt DEI concepts. The law, which took effect in April, threatens schools with the loss of state funding if they are found in violation.Court cites first amendment concernsIn his ruling, Wingate said the law “is unconstitutionally vague, fails to treat speech in a viewpoint-neutral manner, and carries with it serious risks of terrible consequences with respect to the chilling of expression and academic freedom,” according to the Associated Press.He also allowed the plaintiffs to add class-action claims, ensuring the injunction protects all teachers, professors, and students in the state.Teachers warn of chilling effectAt a hearing in early August, educators testified about the risks of teaching under the new law. Cliff Johnson, a professor at the University of Mississippi Law School, told the court that lessons on the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the Civil Rights Act, or even the murders of Emmett Till and Martin Luther King Jr. could be deemed impermissible.“I can teach my class as usual and run the serious risk of being disciplined, or I could abandon something that’s very important to me,” Johnson said, according to the Associated Press. “I feel a bit paralyzed.”State defends lawAttorneys for the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office argued the measure is consistent with government authority over school curriculum.“They are speaking for the government and the government has every right to tell them what they need to say on its behalf,” Assistant Attorney General Lisa Reppeto said, as reported by the Associated Press. She added that the statute’s penalties apply to schools, not to individual teachers or students.National implicationsThe Mississippi case is part of a broader wave of state efforts to limit how schools address race, gender, and sexuality. Legal experts say Wingate’s injunction could serve as a reference point for challenges to similar laws in other states.For now, the ruling allows Mississippi educators to continue discussing contested issues while the lawsuit proceeds — but the larger fight over DEI in schools is likely to intensify nationwide.Ready to navigate global policies?
