The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has dismissed as fake a message circulating on social media claiming that schools and colleges in the city and suburbs would remain closed on Wednesday, August 20, due to a 'red' alert for heavy rainfall.In an official statement shared on X, the civic body said, “This message is fake. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has not issued any such information through its official social media platforms.”Fake closure notice goes viralThe BMC also released an image of the forged message, which had been designed to look like an announcement from its verified handle and was widely shared on WhatsApp groups and other social media platforms. The fake post stated that all government, private, and municipal schools and colleges in Mumbai would be shut on August 20.Orange alert for Mumbai, red alert for RaigadAccording to the civic body, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an orange alert for Mumbai, predicting heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated locations across the city, Thane, and Palghar on August 20.A red alert, however, has been issued for neighbouring Raigad district, where heavy to very heavy showers are expected at some places.The BMC urged citizens not to believe in unverified messages and to rely only on its official communication channels for updates.(with PTI inputs) TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.
