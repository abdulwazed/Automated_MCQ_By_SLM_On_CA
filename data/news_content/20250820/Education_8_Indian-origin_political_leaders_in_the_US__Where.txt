From the Vice President’s office in Washington to the House of Representatives across multiple states, Indian-origin leaders are making history in the United States. As of 2025, at least eight Indian-Americans hold influential positions in US politics, bringing with them diverse professional expertise, cultural identity, and a strong grounding in education.Their academic backgrounds span medicine, law, engineering, economics, and business—fields that continue to resonate with Indian families worldwide. For these politicians, universities were not just stepping stones but launchpads for careers that now shape US domestic and foreign policy.Kamala HarrisThe daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, Kamala Harris made history as America’s first woman and first Indian-origin Vice President. Harris studied economics and political science at Howard University, one of the most prestigious historically Black colleges, before earning her law degree at UC Hastings College of Law. Her legal training laid the foundation for her career as California’s Attorney General and later as US Senator, before rising to the nation’s second-highest office.Ami BeraA practicing physician before entering politics, Dr. Ami Bera represents California’s 6th District.
