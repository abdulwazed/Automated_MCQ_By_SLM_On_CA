Prabhas has solidified his position as the 'Day 1 King' in Indian cinema, consistently delivering massive opening day numbers with films like *Saaho*, *Adipurush*, *Salaar*, and *Kalki 2898 AD*, even when reviews are mixed. His pan-Indian appeal and event-style projects set him apart, establishing a new benchmark for box office success that other South Indian superstars are striving to achieve. In the ever-evolving landscape of Indian cinema, where the box office is increasingly dominated by pan-India spectacles, one actor has carved a space unlike any other: Prabhas. Since the historic success of Baahubali 2: The Conclusion in 2017, Prabhas has become the face of opening day euphoria. No matter the genre, no matter the competition, his films have consistently stormed into theatres with earth-shattering day-one numbers, something even other superstars, despite their stature and talent, have struggled to replicate.And post Baahubali 2, the actor has not done even one sequel thereby taking out the last film’s buzz into account.Baahubali 2 didn’t just change Prabhas’s career; it changed the very grammar of Indian box office reporting. The SS Rajamouli-directed epic opened to record numbers, rewriting the rules of how big a film could go. It was the first film to cross the Rs 1000 crore mark. It also cemented Prabhas as the first genuine pan-India superstar from the South, with fan bases cutting across linguistic and geographical boundaries. Suddenly, Day 1 numbers became the currency of stardom, and every new big-ticket release was compared to the Baahubali phenomenon.The Day 1 StreakWhat makes Prabhas unique is his ability to sustain the “event film” aura beyond Baahubali. While other actors from the South have occasionally breached big numbers, Prabhas has done so consistently, with almost every outing (barring Radhe Shyam).Saaho: Despite mixed reviews and criticism of its screenplay, Saaho stormed into theatres with a Rs 89 crore opening across languages. The film’s scale, action set pieces, and Prabhas’s aura carried it to one of the biggest first days for an Indian film at the time.The film earned over Rs 300 crore at the box office. Radhe Shyam: A rare miss, this romantic drama marked a departure from Prabhas’s mass-action image. With a softer genre and limited appeal in the Hindi belt, the film managed Rs 43.1 crore on opening day—a number still respectable, but far from the benchmark audiences expected.The film folded up at Rs 104 crore.Adipurush: In spite of polarizing reactions and social media criticism, Om Raut’s mythological epic earned a massive Rs 86.75 crore on its opening day. Once again, Prabhas’s star power drove audiences into theatres, underlining his consistent box office draw, the film went on to collect Rs 288.15 crore.Salaar: Part 1 - Ceasefire: Directed by Prashanth Neel of KGF fame, Salaar capitalized on high-octane action and Prabhas’s rugged persona, delivering a Rs 90.7 crore Day 1. The film went on to cement itself as one of the top grossers of the year with Rs 406 crore collection.Kalki 2898 AD : India’s most ambitious sci-fi spectacle lived up to its billing, scoring a record Rs 95.3 crore opening day. The film not only proved Prabhas’s ability to lead big-ticket projects but also showed how his films transcend regional limitations to appeal to audiences across India. The film went on to become one the biggest hits of Indian Cinema with Rs 646 crore collection. This consistent streak—where four out of his last five major films opened above Rs 85 crore is unparalleled in Indian cinema.The Outlier: Radhe ShyamIt’s worth noting that Radhe Shyam’s comparatively lower opening was not due to waning star power but because of a genre mismatch. Prabhas’s fanbase, built on high-octane action spectacles and mythological grandeur, found it difficult to reconcile with a European-set romantic tragedy. Even then, Rs 43.1 crore was no small feat, especially for a film that lacked the mass pull of an action entertainer.Prabhas’s trajectory has had ripple effects across the Indian film industry. Seeing his success, other South Indian superstars began positioning themselves as pan-India actors, dubbing their films in Hindi and expanding release footprints. However, not everyone has managed to match his consistency.Ram Charan: After the massive success of RRR which earned Rs 133 crore on day 1 , his standalone project Game Changer opened to Rs 51 crore solid, but nowhere near Prabhas’s standard as the film fizzled out within the first week.Jr NTR: His post-RRR collection of Rs 133 crore his film Devara debuted at Rs 82.5 crore, just shy of the Rs 85 crore mark, but his next outing War 2 dropped to Rs 52 crore.Allu Arjun: The one exception is Pushpa 2, which exploded with a staggering Rs 164.25 crore Day 1, thanks largely to the carryover craze from Pushpa: The Rise. However, this is more the story of a sequel with unprecedented Hindi market penetration than a sustainable trend across multiple films.This contrast makes Prabhas stand out: his Day 1 numbers are not tied to sequels or Rajamouli but to his own brand value.Why Prabhas WorksSeveral factors explain why Prabhas continues to be the “Day 1 King”:Pan-India Appeal: Unlike most South stars who still have their strongest pull in specific states, Prabhas enjoys near-equal fanbases across Telugu, Tamil, and Hindi markets. His films are marketed simultaneously as national events.Event-Style Projects: Be it Saaho, Salaar, or Kalki 2898 AD, his projects are mounted on massive budgets with VFX, scale, and action that demand big-screen viewing. Audiences know a Prabhas release will be an event, not just a film.With his next Raja Saab he is once again experimenting with horror-comedy. Mystique of Baahubali: The afterglow of Baahubali 2 still lingers. For many audiences, Prabhas is etched as the face of India’s greatest blockbuster, giving him a credibility few can replicate.Global Strategy: Prabhas’s films are planned with worldwide releases in mind, ensuring massive screen counts across India and overseas, which naturally boost Day 1 numbers.The Day 1 figure has now become an industry-wide obsession, and much of that credit (or blame) goes to Prabhas. His consistency has raised expectations for every South Indian superstar attempting pan-India cinema. Audiences and trade analysts now measure stardom not only by lifetime collections but also by the ability to open big on the very first day.In the crowded and competitive world of Indian cinema, Prabhas stands tall as the only actor who has made Rs 85 crore+ Day 1 openings his trademark. From Saaho to Salaar, from Adipurush to Kalki 2898 AD, he has proven time and again that his name alone can drive audiences to theatres in record numbers.While others may score occasionally, consistency is the true marker of stardom. And in that respect, Prabhas is unrivalled—not just in the South, but across India."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorJigar ShahWith nearly 14 years of experience as an entertainment journalist, I have established my credibility in the industry.
