‘Lucky charm’: How a Ukrainian designer styled Zelenskyy for Trump meeting; black suit carried subtle detail
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with US President Donald Trump in a military-style attire designed by Viktor Anisimov, a subtle shift from his usual wartime look. Anisimov aimed to incorporate civilian elements, hoping it would serve as a 'lucky charm' for peace. Trump praised Zelenskyy's outfit, a contrast to a previous tense meeting.

Anisimov aimed to incorporate civilian elements, hoping it would serve as a 'lucky charm' for peace. Trump praised Zelenskyy's outfit, a contrast to a previous tense meeting. Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump (AP) Volodymyr Zelenskyy (PTI) Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump (AP) Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump (AP) Volodymyr Zelenskyy (PTI) Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump (AP) Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump (AP) 123 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy once again set aside a traditional suit during his White House meeting with US President Donald Trump on Monday, choosing instead a refined version of his signature military-style attire. The outfit, designed by Ukrainian designer Viktor Anisimov, featured a black suit with a subtle black vent, a detail that brought it closer to civilian wear while maintaining the wartime aesthetic Zelenskyy has favored throughout the conflict."These are our hopes for peace," Anisimov was quoted as saying by Reuters. "We think that if we add something subtle to this image, something from civilian clothing to his uniform, then it will be like a lucky charm.”Trump praised Zelenskyy’s less formal suit as he arrived at the White House for talks on Monday, on the Russia-Ukraine war, a notable shift from their tense February meeting. Earlier this year, however, an American journalist had questioned Zelenskyy’s choice of attire during his meeting with Trump and US Vice President JD Vance.Anisimov, 61, from Ukraine’s northern Chernihiv region, said that while watching videos of the exchange, he felt the remarks were directed not only at Zelenskyy but at the Ukrainian people as a whole. "There was a slight sense of despair because they do not understand how we breathe, how we live," Anisimov said as quoted by Reuters.Zelenskyy has worn Anisimov’s designs at key moments, including the funeral of Pope Francis in April and the NATO Summit in June."I can't say that we sewed (a suit) specifically for the NATO summit or for an important conversation with Trump and European leaders. The suit is just a suit," Anisimov said. He added that Zelenskyy has about five similar-looking jackets with only small tweaks.The White House reporter, Brian Glenn, who had asked Zelenskyy in February why he was not wearing a suit, praised his outfit choice on Monday, saying, "you look fabulous in that suit".Anisimov said he was not focused on criticism or compliments this time, but on making sure the Ukrainian president appeared dignified. "They praise, they scold. If we win, and we will win, then whose suit it was doesn't matter," he said“We had already started working on the president’s new wardrobe and style in January. After what happened in February, knowing our president’s principles, I thought that he would not want to change his style. But no, he decided that we should continue,” Anisimov was quoted as saying by Womenswear Daily.“It’s not about the suit, it’s about what happens to Ukraine,” Anisimov added.This was not the first time Anisimov had been tasked with reshaping the president’s style. Back in the early 2000s, when Zelenskyy was still a comedian, Anisimov helped design the Ukrainian president's and his crew’s wardrobe. Zelenskyy pledged in 2022 that he would not return to wearing a suit and tie or shaving his beard until Ukraine achieves victory in the war, as per the Financial Times.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Bondi had sent a letter to Ferguson last week notifying him that Washington had been identified by the White House as a jurisdiction that “engages in sanctuary policies” obstructing federal immigration enforcement. She warned of consequences ranging from withholding federal grants to prosecuting officials for allegedly using their positions “to obstruct federal immigration enforcement efforts and facilitating or inducing illegal immigration.” Ferguson held a news conference shortly after noon in the State Reception Room of the Legislative Building in Olympia, where he delivered his response to the August 13 letter. Bondi’s letter had demanded that the governor drop the state’s sanctuary policies, setting a Tuesday deadline for a reply. Washington state, she wrote, was a “sanctuary” jurisdiction that frustrated federal immigration enforcement to the detriment of national interests. She further warned that officials obstructing such efforts could face criminal charges, while noncompliant local and state governments could face civil liability. “(Attorney General) Pam Bondi … seeks to have Washington state bend the knee to a Trump administration that, day by day, drags us closer to authoritarianism. That’s not going to happen,” Ferguson said. “I am not intimidated by Pam Bondi, or the president.”Citing Bondi’s letter as a dangerous escalation, Ferguson said it reflected demands that governors and mayors “bend the knee” to the president. “That is breathtaking, and a letter like this cannot be normalized,” he said. “Let me be very clear. Washington state will not be bullied or intimidated by threats and legally baseless accusations.” “In the America that I love, that I taught my children to revere, we resolve our differences peacefully through public discourse — and if necessary, through the courts — not by threatening political opponents with imprisonment,” he added. The governor highlighted the state’s 2019 law, the Keep Washington Working Act, which limits the role of local law enforcement in aiding federal authorities on immigration matters. The law bars police from arresting or detaining individuals solely based on their immigration status and prohibits jails from holding people for federal custody unless presented with a warrant or court order signed by a judge or magistrate. Ferguson and Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown have consistently defended the law, maintaining that it does not interfere with the federal government’s ability to enforce immigration laws. Brown’s office has repeatedly argued that the act does not thwart federal authority. Ferguson was joined at the news conference by immigration rights advocates, state legislators, and Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell, who had also received a similar letter from Bondi naming Seattle as a sanctuary jurisdiction. According to Bondi, the notices sent to Seattle and Washington state were part of 32 letters issued last week to governors and mayors of Democratic-led “sanctuary” jurisdictions.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The monastery complex on Sir Bani Yas Island includes courtyard houses where monks lived in seclusion, indicating a structured early Christian community/ Image: National A newly uncovered Christian cross from a seventh- to eighth-century monastery on Abu Dhabi’s Sir Bani Yas Island is offering rare insight into the region’s deep-rooted religious coexistence. Found during the first major excavation on the island in more than 30 years, the discovery marks a significant moment in the UAE’s archaeological record and strengthens the narrative of its multicultural past.A rediscovery three decades in the makingIn January 2025, the Department of Culture and Tourism – Abu Dhabi (DCT Abu Dhabi) launched a new archaeological campaign on Sir Bani Yas Island, located off the coast of the Al Dhafra region. This marked the first major excavation on the island in over 30 years. Among the season’s most significant findings was a Christian cross, moulded on a plaster (stucco) plaque, uncovered within one of the courtyard buildings near a historic monastery. The cross, believed to have been used by monks for spiritual reflection, is linked to the Church of the East, an early Christian denomination with origins in ancient Iraq. It bears stylistic similarities to religious artefacts previously found in Iraq and Kuwait, pointing to the monastery’s connection with a broader religious network that once spanned from the Middle East to as far as China. Measuring 27 centimetres in length, 17 centimetres in width, and about 2 centimetres thick, the plaster cross is adorned with regional motifs. These include a stepped pyramid representing Golgotha, the hill where Jesus is believed to have been crucified, sprouting leaves at the base, dots at the tips of the cross arms, and an arched niche design. According to archaeologist Maria Gajewska, who leads the excavation team, “Visually, every element of the plaster cross incorporates regional motifs… all find regional parallels in the Gulf and Mesopotamia.” Speaking to The National, Gajewska described the discovery as “an extremely exciting find” and a rare instance where archaeologists can clearly identify the community that once occupied a space. “We were just digging in the right place… Incredible,” she said.The story behind the find The cross was discovered face down in February 2025 by Hager Al Menhali, an Emirati archaeologist with DCT Abu Dhabi. “The plaster was resting face down and something about it caught my attention,” she told The National. “There was a distinct fingerprint on the back.” Thinking the print alone was significant, Al Menhali proposed registering the object as a special find. But when the team carefully turned it over, they were stunned to see a well-preserved cross. “This was one of the most significant discoveries of the season,” said Al Menhali. The discovery took place within a courtyard house to the north of the island’s main church and monastery site, an area that had not been explored in depth until this season. This zone is now considered to have been used by monks in retreat or seclusion. The surrounding buildings, some constructed with limestone and coral native to the island, feature thick walls and water cisterns, indications of a lifestyle more comfortable than one of strict asceticism. These features suggest the early Christian residents were not merely hermits but members of a larger, structured monastic community.Unearthing a rich and layered past Sir Bani Yas has long held archaeological significance. A Christian monastery dating back to the seventh or eighth century CE was first discovered there in 1992 by the Abu Dhabi Islands Archaeological Survey (ADIAS), under the UAE’s leadership. Since then, excavations have revealed a church and monastic complex believed to have operated simultaneously. Current interpretations suggest that while the monastery served as a broader communal religious site, individual monks would retreat to courtyard homes nearby for isolated contemplation. The recent discovery of the plaster cross provides strong evidence that Christianity was not confined to the monastery, but permeated other parts of the island community. At its peak, Christianity in the Arabian Peninsula thrived between the fourth and sixth centuries CE. Sir Bani Yas is part of a network of Christian sites that emerged during this period, with parallels found in Umm Al Quwain, Kuwait, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. Christianity on the island is believed to have coexisted with Islam until the eighth century CE, when the site was peacefully abandoned. Interestingly, the archaeological team has found no evidence of sudden destruction or conflict at the site. Instead, the clean and intact condition of the buildings suggests an intentional departure, possibly with the expectation of return. Additional finds from this season include pottery fragments and a sea-green glass bottle, likely used to hold oil or rosewater. These artefacts, along with others such as a stamp seal with a scorpion motif and glass chalices from earlier digs, are now on display at a small on-site exhibition.Preservation and the path ahead The Sir Bani Yas church and monastery are now sheltered and preserved, thanks to restoration works carried out by DCT Abu Dhabi in 2019. The site is open to the public, featuring improved signage and visitor facilities. A multi-faith church, inspired by the original structures, has also been constructed near the visitor centre to symbolise the values of unity and coexistence.Further excavation is planned at the courtyard houses, with the intention of integrating them into a larger cultural trail connecting significant sites across the island. Native wildlife, including Arabian gazelles and rock hyraxes, species known to inhabit the island since ancient times, are also part of the broader heritage landscape. DCT Abu Dhabi is conducting radiocarbon dating and in-depth analysis of the newly unearthed artefacts.Mohamed Khalifa Al Mubarak, Chairman of DCT Abu Dhabi, emphasised the wider significance of the discovery, linking it to the UAE’s enduring cultural values.“The discovery of this ancient Christian cross on Sir Bani Yas Island is a powerful testament to the UAE’s profound and enduring values of coexistence and cultural openness. It stirs within us a deep sense of pride and honour and reminds us that peaceful coexistence is not a modern construct, but a principle woven into the very fabric of our region’s history.”He also highlighted the long-term impact of archaeological work on the island and its relevance for future generations:“The ongoing discoveries from Sir Bani Yas Island, even after 30 years of research and excavation, underscore the magnitude of our cultural legacy and the importance of our continued commitment to its preservation and understanding… These discoveries deepen our connection to the past and inspire future generations to embrace the spirit of unity and mutual respect that has long defined our community.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Despite failing English and road sign tests, he obtained commercial driver's licenses in California and Washington. The incident has ignited a political clash between the Trump administration and California Governor Gavin Newsom over immigration and licensing policies, highlighting concerns about public safety.  Harjinder Singh, the Indian immigrant trucker, accused of killing 3 people in Florida after making a reckless U-turn on highway, badly flunked English fluency and road sign tests after the fatal crash, the US department of transportation said. He answered only two out of 12 questions correctly in English language proficiency test by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. Singh could only identify one out of four highway signs shown to him, the department of transportation (DOT) said.Despite these failures, he is belived to have entered America illegally in 2018 and was granted commercial driver's licenses (CDL) in California and Washington state.Sean Duffy, transportation secretary said, "This crash was a preventable tragedy directly caused by reckless decisions and compounded by despicable failures." PollDo you think stricter license and immigration checks could prevent tragedies like this?Yes, stricter checks are neededNo, current measures are sufficient"Non-enforcement and radical immigration policies have turned the trucking industry into a lawless frontier, resulting in unqualified foreign drivers improperly acquiring licenses to operate 40-ton vehicles," Duffy added. The Harjinder Singh controversy has become the latest point of tension between US President Donald Trump's administration and California governor Gavin Newsom.Singh, an Indian-origin truck driver, has been charged with three counts of vehicular homicide after he made a reckless U-turn on Florida Turnpike that led to a devastating collision of a minivan, killing three people. Singh has been living in US illegally since 2018 after crossing the Mexico border. The viral video has sent shockwaves, triggering criticism.Singh was arrested in California on Saturday by US marshals and is now facing deportation.Despite living illegally in US, Singh was issued a commercial driver's license by the California department of motor vehicles (DMV). Taking a jab at California governor, department of homeland security (DHS), in a post on X wrote, "How many more innocent people have to die before Gavin Newsom stops playing games with the safety of the American public?"It added that the department is working to free America from illegal aliens. Countering DHS, Newsom's press office in a post claimed that Singh entered US in 2018 when Trump was president and Newsom became the governor of California in 2019.After entering US, Singh was arrested by the Border Patrol and faced fast-track deportation, but he "claimed fear of going back to India." He was then released on a $5,000 immigration bond in January 2019 and was given a notice to appear.Since then, Singh has remained in immigration proceedings."The illegal alien is an Indian national who was granted a commercial driver's license by the so-called 'sanctuary state' of California, whose reckless policies put the lives of American citizens at risk every single day," said White House.It attacked Newsom further, saying that "instead of acknowledging the tragedy, criminal illegal alien sympathiser Gavin Newsom callously doubled down, claiming that giving driver's licenses to illegals 'improves public safety'."About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

In a video later shown on state television, the Russian official told Warren, "I have to say that this is a personal gift from the President of the Russian Federation."The heartwarming scenario unfolded on August 9 when Warren was out on his ancient Soviet-era motorcycle running errands when he was stopped by a Russian TV crew. After admiring his ride, the reporter asked him about the Putin-Trump meeting and the war's economic effects.Warren told the Anchorage Daily News that the numerous sanctions imposed on Russia had made it difficult and expensive to fix spare components for his bike because the new production facility was in Ukraine.Warren claimed that a few days later, he was called by the reporters to let him know that Putin had taken notice of the video after it went viral in Russia. At first, he thought their offer of a brand-new, $22,000 bike was a hoax, calling it "bats-t crazy," as reported by the New York Post.However, the handover was arranged by Russian embassy workers less than 24 hours after Putin and Trump met. According to the claim, Warren was seen on camera accepting the motorcycle and testing it out.It's day and night. Although I still enjoy my old one, this one is clearly superior. It's so amazing that I can't even speak. In the video, Warren remarked, "Thank you very much."Founded in 1941 in Soviet Russia, Ural is a motorcycle manufacturer with its headquarters located in the state of Washington. Following the crisis between Russia and Ukraine, the corporation moved its operations to Kazakhstan, according to the New York Post.This is the second instance in which the Russian side has publicly shown its nostalgia for the Soviet Union. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was spotted sporting a white sweatshirt bearing the Russian acronym for the USSR, "CCCP," the day before the Trump-Putin meeting in Alaska.After the meeting in Alaska, President Putin praised Trump's efforts to end the dispute. "The Ukrainian nation, and I have said it multiple times, is a brotherly nation; however strange it may sound in these conditions. We have the same roots, and everything that's happening is a tragedy for us. And a terrible wound,” Putin remarked, highlighting the historical connections between Ukraine and Russia.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Redistricting row: California Republicans sue to block Newsom’s plan
California Republicans have petitioned the state Supreme Court to block Governor Newsom's redistricting plan, alleging Democrats are rushing legislation to add five Democratic congressional seats. The GOP argues this violates the state constitution's public review rule and undermines the independent redistricting commission.

The GOP argues this violates the state constitution's public review rule and undermines the independent redistricting commission. File photo: California Governor Gavin Newsom (Picture credit: AP) California Republicans have asked the state Supreme Court to block Governor Gavin Newsom’s redistricting plan, arguing Democrats are rushing legislation that could add five new Democratic congressional seats to counter Republican gains in Texas.The emergency petition, filed Monday by four Republican lawmakers, claims the plan violates the state constitution’s 30-day public review rule for new legislation. “Instead of a months-long transparent and participatory process overseen by an independent citizens redistricting commission … the public would be presented with an up-or-down vote on maps unilaterally prepared in secret by the Legislature,” the lawsuit said, according to The New York Times.Republicans want the court to pause the process until at least September 18 unless each legislative chamber secures a three-fourths vote to move faster, according to news agency Reuters. They also requested the court either rule on the merits by Wednesday or halt the process while the case is under review.Democratic leaders, who hold supermajorities in Sacramento, intend to pass three bills under what they have called the “Election Rigging Response Act” on Thursday to meet Newsom’s deadline for a November 4 special election. A spokesperson for the governor dismissed the challenge, saying: “Republicans are filing a deeply unserious (and truly laughable) lawsuit to stop Americans from voting? We’re neither surprised, nor worried,” as per Axios.The push is part of a broader national battle sparked when US President Donald Trump urged Texas Republicans to redraw maps mid-decade to secure five more GOP seats. Democrats in California are now pursuing a “tit-for-tat” strategy, according to Reuters, to offset Texas and preserve House control. Republicans currently hold a narrow 219-212 majority in the chamber.Critics say the move undermines California’s independent redistricting commission, created by voters in 2008 to ensure transparency. Democrats argue it is a temporary emergency measure to counter “extreme” gerrymandering efforts elsewhere.The lawsuit also highlights technical constitutional questions, including whether the 30-day clock begins when a bill number is assigned or only after the full text is introduced. California law also requires the final text of bills to be available 72 hours before any vote, a rule Democrats say they are observing with Thursday’s planned passage, The New York Times reported.The National Republican Congressional Committee has already signalled plans for further litigation.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The Trump administration revoked security clearances for 37 current and former national security officials, alleging politicization of intelligence. Critics, including national security lawyer Mark Zaid, condemned the move as politically motivated and unlawful. Senator Mark Warner suggested it was a distraction from the Epstein documents.

Critics, including national security lawyer Mark Zaid, condemned the move as politically motivated and unlawful. Senator Mark Warner suggested it was a distraction from the Epstein documents. The revocations raise concerns about the U.S. File photo: Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard (Picture credit: AP) The Trump administration has stripped security clearances from 37 current and former national security officials, escalating its campaign against intelligence professionals it accuses of undermining the president’s agenda.A memo issued by director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Tuesday alleged that those affected had engaged in the “politicisation or weaponisation of intelligence,” mishandled classified material, or failed to maintain professional standards. However, the document did not provide evidence to support the claims.The move cut across multiple agencies, with both senior and mid-level figures targeted. The list included Shelby Pierson, a senior election-threat analyst; Vinh X. Nguyen, an NSA data scientist specialising in artificial intelligence and quantum computing; and a senior CIA analyst currently serving undercover.Critics condemned the revocations as politically motivated. “These are unlawful and unconstitutional decisions that deviate from well-settled, decades-old laws and policies,” said national security lawyer Mark Zaid, as quoted by AP, whose own clearance was revoked by the Trump administration. He called it hypocritical to accuse others of politicising intelligence while engaging in such actions.Gabbard defended the decision on social media, writing: “Being entrusted with a security clearance is a privilege, not a right. Those in the Intelligence Community who betray their oath … have broken the sacred trust they promised to uphold.” She confirmed the revocations were carried out under Trump’s direction.As per AP, the revocations form part of a broader push by the administration to revisit and discredit the 2017 intelligence assessment that concluded Russia interfered in the 2016 election in Trump’s favour. Multiple investigations have upheld those findings, noting both cyber intrusions and social media operations linked to Moscow.Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, criticised the action as “a reckless abuse of the clearance process” and suggested it was also an attempt to distract from the administration’s refusal to release documents linked to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.The consequences for current officials are immediate, with clearances tied to their jobs. For former officials, the impact is less clear, though some could face difficulties in private-sector work that requires access to classified material.This is not the first time Trump has wielded clearance revocations as a political tool. He has previously stripped access from former President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and more than four dozen ex-officials who signed a 2020 letter questioning the Hunter Biden laptop story. Several members of President Biden’s former national security team were also on the latest list.For some in the intelligence community, the loss of key personnel such as Nguyen raises concerns about the United States’ technological edge. According to The New York Times, former colleagues warned his removal could set back NSA projects in areas such as data science and cyber operations.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

In a statement posted on X, the prosecutor’s office confirmed that the heads belonged to 'men' but did not provide further details about the case. Bodies were discovered on Tuesday morning on a route linking Puebla and Tlaxcala, located just over 100 kilometers (62 miles) from Mexico City. Police did not confirm a motive for the killings or identify the criminal group behind the act. Local media, however, reported that a blanket was found at the scene carrying a message addressed to rival gangs and apparently signed by a group calling itself “La Barredora”, reported BBC. The prosecutor’s office in Tlaxcala said it had opened a formal investigation into the killings. Earlier this year, authorities in Sinaloa discovered 20 male bodies bearing gunshot wounds, including five that were decapitated, on a bridge over a federal highway.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Yosemite National Park: Ranger fired for hanging transgender pride flag on El Capitan
A Yosemite National Park ranger, Shannon “SJ” Joslin, was fired after helping hang a large transgender pride flag on El Capitan. This action, done in protest of Trump administration policies, led to stricter park rules on banners and flags. Two other rangers are under investigation, and the Justice Department is considering actions against those involved, sparking condemnation from advocates.

This action, done in protest of Trump administration policies, led to stricter park rules on banners and flags. Two other rangers are under investigation, and the Justice Department is considering actions against those involved, sparking condemnation from advocates. Ranger fired for hanging transgender pride flag on El Capitan A ranger at Yosemite National Park has been dismissed after helping drape a giant transgender pride flag across El Capitan, sparking a wider crackdown on protests at the California landmark.Shannon “SJ” Joslin, a 35-year-old ranger and biologist who studies bats, confirmed they were terminated last week after unfurling the 66-foot-wide flag on 20 May with a group of climbers. The flag, which remained for around two hours, was removed voluntarily. In a letter of dismissal, Yosemite’s acting deputy superintendent said Joslin had “failed to demonstrate acceptable conduct” in their role as a federal employee, reported The New York Times.Joslin, who identifies as nonbinary, was quoted as saying by news agency AP that she had acted out of personal conviction amid policies from the Trump administration that “target trans people.” She added, “I hung the flag as a way to tell myself we’re safe in national parks. Instead, this firing says the opposite, that federal workers who don’t align with this administration must stay silent or be eliminated.”Two other rangers who joined the action have been placed on administrative leave pending investigation, Joslin said. Park officials confirmed the justice department is considering administrative and possible criminal action against both employees and visitors involved. Violators could face fines of up to $5,000 and jail terms of six months.The Park Service tightened rules a day after the incident, banning flags or banners larger than 15 square feet in 94% of the park. “Displaying signs, banners and flags outside of designated First Amendment areas detracts from the visitor experience,” said spokesperson Rachel Pawlitz, as cited by AP.Yosemite, she added, must balance free expression with the protection of wilderness and visitor safety.Advocates have condemned the firing. Environmentalist and drag performer Pattie Gonia, who joined in hanging the flag, was quoted by AP as she called Joslin “a respected pillar within the Yosemite community.” Jayson O’Neill from Save Our Parks claimed the decision was meant to intimidate workers from speaking out, while Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility is now representing Joslin.Demonstrations at El Capitan have become more frequent. Earlier this year, protesters displayed an inverted US flag to criticise Trump-era cuts to the Park Service workforce. Since Trump took office, the service has lost about 2,500 employees, with a further $900 million cut proposed for next year, according to AP.For Joslin, Yosemite was more than a workplace. “Everything I did was off the clock and had nothing to do with my role,” she was quoted as saying by The New York Times. “Yosemite is my whole life”, she added.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

She had three children in four years. This was after a fraud conviction in 2020. Authorities discovered irregularities in her living arrangements. Her children were living with other family members. She is now serving her five-year sentence. . A Chinese woman who repeatedly became pregnant to avoid imprisonment has now been sentenced. Identified by the pseudonym Chen Hong, the woman received a five-year prison term for fraud in December 2020 in Shanxi province, local media reported, as cited by South China Morning Post.Chen repeatedly became pregnant, having three children with the same man over four years, reportedly in an attempt to avoid serving her prison sentence. When confronted with the evidence, she admitted she was already divorced.In China, inmates who are seriously ill, pregnant or nursing, or are unable to care for themselves may be temporarily allowed to serve their sentences outside prison.During this period, they are placed under community correction, either at hospitals or in their own homes, and are supervised by their local correctional institutions, typically run by prisons and public security authorities.The local prosecutors conduct regular inspections to oversee such arrangements. During one such inspection in May, officials found that Chen, who recently gave birth to her third child, was not living with her baby.They also discovered that the child’s household registration was listed under Chen’s sister-in-law, making the baby legally her sister-in-law’s child.Her first two children were living with her ex-husband, while her third child was living with his sister.With less than a year remaining on her sentence, Chen was returned to the detention center rather than a prison to serve the rest of her term.“I was more shocked that she could get pregnant when she wanted,” a social media user commented.“I pity the three children who were born only because their mother wanted to escape prison,” said another.Some prosecutors have proposed that in cases where convicts repeatedly become pregnant, the legal system should suspend their sentence instead of continuing to count prison time.“This approach would also help protect the rights of their unborn children,” prosecutors from Yancheng in Jiangsu province wrote in an article, as cited by South China Morning Post.This is not the first case of its kind. A Chinese woman reportedly evaded prison for a decade by becoming pregnant 13 times. The woman, who was 29 at the time, was convicted of corruption and sentenced to life in prison in 2005a, as reported by People’s Daily Online.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Kennedy Jr. has rolled out the “Pete and Bobby Challenge”, pairing up with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth as part of the Trump administration’s nationwide “Make America Healthy Again” campaign. Kennedy and Pete Hegseth squared off in a fitness contest that involved completing 50 pull-ups and 100 pushups in under five minutes at the Pentagon. The challenge was unveiled through a video first shared with Fox News Digital. The initiative is aimed at encouraging Americans to swap “fat” for “fit.” “I teamed up with @SecDef Hegseth for the ‘Pete & Bobby Challenge’ — 50 pull-ups, 100 push-ups. This is the start of a nationwide push to get Americans fit again,” Kennedy wrote on X. The contest saw both leaders push their limits, with Hegseth finishing just over the five-minute mark, emerging as the winner in the challenge.Secretary Kennedy also invited Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy to take part in the next round of the challenge.Pete Hegseth in a post on X thanked President Donald Trump for his efforts to make Americans fit again. "President Trump set the example by putting forth efforts to make America healthy again. That’s why we are introducing the Pete and Bobby challenge. 100 push-ups. 50 pull-ups. 10 minutes." The effort tied into the broader health push by the Trump administration. Kennedy advocated for whole foods over processed meals, while Hegseth linked the campaign to ensuring the US military remained among the fittest and best-prepared forces in the world. At the youth level, President Donald Trump reinstated the Presidential Fitness Test and the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition, which had been retired under former President Barack Obama in favor of the Presidential Youth Fitness Program. By executive order signed in July, Trump directed the council to launch school-based programs that reward excellence in physical education and to design a Presidential Fitness Award.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Florida executed Kayle Barrington Bates, convicted of the 1982 abduction and murder of Janet Renee White, marking the state's record 10th execution this year.

Despite last-minute appeals citing brain damage and racial bias, the courts rejected them. Bates' execution is part of a nationwide trend, with 29 executions carried out this year, the highest in a decade. File photo: Kayle Barrington Bates and Janet Renee White (Picture credit: AP, X) Florida on Tuesday carried out its record 10th execution of the year, putting to death Kayle Barrington Bates, who was convicted of abducting and murdering insurance worker Janet Renee White in 1982.Bates, 67, received a lethal injection at Florida State Prison near Starke and was pronounced dead at 6:17 pm (local time), according to the state’s department of corrections. Governor Ron DeSantis had signed the death warrant last month. Witnesses said Bates declined to make a final statement and refused a last meal. As per news agency AP, he was strapped to a gurney, and the execution began at 6:01 pm (local time). He was unresponsive within minutes and declared dead shortly after.White’s husband, Randy White, who witnessed the execution, described it as long-awaited justice. “I made a promise to her right after it happened that I would be there for every trial, every hearing, every appeal, and that as long as I was living, I would seek justice for her,” he was quoted as saying by USA Today. “I feel a relief that I can mentally let Renee know that justice has finally been served for her, and that’s mentally what I need. It’s always been for her.”Court records show Bates abducted White from her State Farm office in Lynn Haven, dragged her into nearby woods, attempted to sexually assault her, stabbed her to death and stole her wedding ring. He was arrested shortly afterwards, covered in blood, with the ring in his pocket.Bates’ lawyers had filed last-minute appeals, including claims of organic brain damage and racial bias in Florida’s use of the death penalty, but the Florida Supreme Court and the US Supreme Court rejected them. A federal lawsuit accusing DeSantis of discrimination in signing death warrants was also dismissed.Veterans’ groups had urged the governor to spare Bates because of his service in the Florida National Guard, but DeSantis maintained he was signing warrants for “the worst of the worst.” A spokeswoman said the execution was based solely on his crimes, not his military status.Since the US Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, Florida’s highest previous annual total was eight executions in 2014.

The new account, @whitehouse, went live on Tuesday evening with an inaugural video featuring footage of Trump declaring: “I am your voice.” The clip was captioned, “America we are BACK! What’s up TikTok?” and had drawn about 4,500 followers within an hour of posting. The debut came against the backdrop of uncertainty over TikTok’s future in the US. A federal law mandating the app’s sale or a nationwide ban on national security grounds had been scheduled to take effect on January 20, the day before Trump’s inauguration. However, the Republican president, who leaned heavily on social media during his 2024 campaign and has often expressed fondness for TikTok, paused the ban. TikTok, owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, remains under scrutiny. In April, the company confirmed it had been in talks with the US government to seek a resolution and noted that any agreement “will be subject to approval under Chinese law,” the Guardian reported. In June, Trump extended the deadline for the third time, granting the video-sharing platform an additional 90 days to secure a non-Chinese buyer or face a ban in the country. The extension is set to expire in mid-September.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

US eyes Budapest for Trump-Putin-Zelenskyy meet; Russia signals gradual approach
The White House is reportedly considering Budapest for a high-stakes trilateral meeting between Presidents Trump, Putin, and Zelenskyy. While the US Secret Service prepares in Hungary, Moscow prefers Russia as the venue, and France suggested Geneva. This follows Trump's Alaska meeting with Putin, with discussions ongoing regarding security guarantees for Ukraine and potential peacekeeping missions, despite Russian officials slowing progress.

File photo: Russian President Vladimir Putin, US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy (Picture credit: AP) The White House is considering Budapest as the potential venue for a high-stakes trilateral meeting between US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, according to a Trump administration official and a person familiar with the discussions.According to Politico, the US Secret Service has begun preparations in Hungary, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, a long-time ally of Trump. However, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to confirm details, saying, “I’m not going to confirm or deny locations.” While Moscow has pushed for the talks to take place in Russia and French President Emmanuel Macron has suggested Geneva, Budapest has emerged as the frontrunner, Politico noted. Switzerland also offered itself as a host, with its foreign minister promising “immunity” to Putin despite an outstanding war crimes warrant.Hungary’s selection would be sensitive for Kyiv, recalling the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, under which the US, UK and Russia guaranteed Ukraine’s sovereignty in exchange for it giving up nuclear weapons, a pledge undermined by Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea.Despite ongoing uncertainty, momentum has built following Trump’s recent Alaska meeting with Putin. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said a bilateral between Putin and Zelenskyy could happen within weeks, with Trump later announcing he would join them in a trilateral format as a “final step.” Russian officials, however, are said to be slowing progress. Foreign minister Sergey Lavrov told state television Moscow favoured talks that proceed “step by step, gradually.”At Tuesday’s briefing, Leavitt confirmed that “President Trump spoke with President Putin by phone, and he agreed to begin the next phase of the peace process, a meeting between President Putin and President Zelenskyy, which would be followed, if necessary, by a trilateral meeting between President Putin, President Zelenskyy and President Trump.” As per Fox News, she added that Vice President JD Vance, secretary of state Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff were coordinating efforts to make the bilateral happen “as soon as possible.”The update came a day after Zelenskyy and several European leaders met Trump at the White House to discuss next steps. Leaders praised Trump’s role, with Finnish President Alexander Stubb remarking, “In the past two weeks, we’ve probably had more progress in ending this war than we have in the past three-and-a-half years.” UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer echoed the view, saying that for years “nobody has been able to bring it to this point.” Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte added, “Without President Trump, this deadlock with Putin would not have been broken.”According to Politico, Nato defence chiefs and senior military leaders from the US, UK, Germany, France, Finland and Italy are holding parallel talks in Washington on possible security guarantees for Ukraine, including discussions over a peacekeeping mission and additional American arms.Putin, meanwhile, used his joint press conference with Trump in Alaska to endorse Trump’s long-standing claim about the origins of the war, saying, “I can confirm that” Russia would not have invaded Ukraine if Trump had been re-elected in 2020.As questions continue about long-term security guarantees for Ukraine beyond Trump’s current term, Leavitt said the president “understands the need” and is discussing future commitments with Nato and European partners.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

USCIS will take a holistic view of your ‘good moral character’Lubna Kably / TNN / Updated: Aug 17, 2025, 22:47 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLarge  The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has announced a major policy shift that restores a rigorous and holistic approach to evaluating ‘good moral character’ (GMC) of foreign nationals applying for American citizenship.To illustrate: Driving under influence could impair your eligibility, but if you have skipped on taxes – but subsequently coughed up your dues this could be a redeeming factor. Or if you have good educational qualifications and job stability, this too could score you brownie points. The policy memorandum, issued on Aug 15, emphasizes that US citizenship is more than a legal benefit—it represents a profound transformation into active and responsible membership in American society.Trump Outrages World With Unprecedented Travel Ban | 'Racist, Downright Cruel'In fiscal 2024 (year ended Sept 30), 8.18 lakh foreign nationals acquired US citizenship. Mexicans led with as many as 1.07 lakh becoming American citizens (13% of the total), this was followed by Indians, with a little over 49,000 (or 6% of the total) acquiring US citizenship. The trend was similar to earlier years, Indians are the second largest contingent to acquire US citizenship.Going forward, those aspiring to become US citizens will be subjected to the new policy guidelines. Titled – ‘Restoring a rigorous, holistic and comprehensive good moral character evaluation standard for aliens applying for naturalization (citizenship)’, under it USCIS officials will no longer treat GMC as a simple checklist of disqualifying offenses. Instead, they are directed to consider the ‘totality of circumstances’, weighing both negative conduct and positive contributions.The policy highlights that while certain offenses—such as murder, aggravated felonies, torture, or genocide—remain permanent and unconditional bars to naturalization, officials must now also assess evidence of rehabilitation and reformation in other cases.“The regulations and policy affirm that GMC findings must go beyond the absence of disqualifying acts—it must reflect a genuine positive assessment of who the applicant is and how they have lived in their community,” the policy states.Positive attributes and contributions such as sustained community involvement and contributions in the US; family caregiving, responsibility, and ties in the US; educational attainments; stable and lawful employment history and achievements; length of lawful residence in the US, compliance with tax obligations and financial responsibility in the US will carry greater weight. .At the same time USCIS officials will scrutinize behaviours inconsistent with civic responsibility, including repeat driving under influence convictions, false claims to citizenship, unlawful voting, and even patterns of reckless or disruptive conduct.Immigration attorneys are largely of the view that a move away from a rule-based model to a more discretionary one may be a slippery slope. Eligibility results could vary based on the subjective discretion of the official vetting the application and could result in lack of uniformity across cases.In general individuals can apply for US citizenship, after they have been lawful permanent residents (green card holders) for at least five years. A Chicago based Indian family that was examining the possibility of applying for citizenship told TOI, “Years ago, when we initially moved to the US, both of us faced tax disputes owing to interpretation of the India-US tax treaty. This could be a blot on our record.”Loss of jobs during the pandemic and non repayment of interest or principal amount against loans could also be issues that come up for many aspirants during processing of citizenship applications, they point out.However, there appears to be a ray of hope. For applicants with past ‘wrongdoing’ , USCIS officials will look for concrete evidence of rehabilitation, including repayment of taxes, compliance with court-ordered conditions, or testimony from community members. According to the policy guidelines, such evidence may support a finding of good moral character even where negative history exists, provided no permanent bar applies.It may be recalled that Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed as director of USCIS in July, told NY Times in an interview that the current US citizenship test is “too easy”—noting that many applicants can simply memorize answers and pass without true understanding. This is another change that could be on the anvil.About the AuthorLubna KablyLubna Kably is a senior editor, who focuses on various policies and legislation.

A Canadian court has blocked the deportation of Jagjit Singh, an Indian-origin man, citing that his separation from his wife, who has ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder), will cause "irreparable harm" to the wife. According to the court filing, Singh came to Canada in 2021 on a temporary resident visa and made a refugee claim. Then he got married in Canada and his wife applied to sponsor his permanent resident application, and Jagjit Singh withdrew his refugee claim this year.But his removal process already began while his resident application was under review and the Canada Border Services Agency finally ordered him to be deported. Singh appealed to Canada's federal court against the deportation order and claimed that he would be in danger if he were sent back to India.Singh also claimed that his removal would cause "serious prejudices to his spouse due to her health conditions".Federal Judge Avvy Yao-Yao Go said she has evidence in front of her that Singh's wife, referred to as LB in court documents, suffers from ADHD which impairs her ability to manage time and everyday responsibilities. "In the case before me, there is evidence that L.B. suffers from ADHD which impairs her ability to manage time, stress focus and everyday responsibilities and that [Singh] provides her with support by, among other things, helping her maintain daily structure and reminders for medications and appointments, and providing her with emotional stability and mental health support," Go said.The ruling drew backlash on social media, with many users pointing out that ADHD is not that serious. "The judge who halted an Indian man's deportation order because his wife has ADHD was an activist before being appointed to the bench," one wrote. Many social media users said his wife should also go to India with him. "I wonder how his wife survived before she met him?" one person said. "This is beyond insulting. Not only to people with ADHD, but to our country. So pathetic," another wrote.The judge faced backlash for citing his wife’s ADHD as an excuse, with many saying it undermined those who actually suffer from the condition Avvy Yao-Yao Go immigrated to Canada from Hong Kong in the 1980s and worked as Clinic Director of the Chinese and Southeast Asian Legal Clinic before becoming a judge.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

One of the group took his metal water bottle and hit him above the eye, causing heavy bleeding. He was taken to hospital where he received eight stitches. Gardaí confirmed they are investigating the assault and his injuries are “non-life threatening”.An Indian-origin woman has put a post on Reddit saying her 60-year-old father was harassed by boys, aged around seven and eight, who tried to take his wallet at a bus stop in Dublin on Aug 9.These are just the latest in a string of racist attacks targeting Indians in Ireland which have left the Indian community terrified to step outside.India Day in Ireland, which celebrates the country’s cultural ties, has been postponed this Sunday owing to the wave of hate crimes. The event has been organised by the Ireland India Council since 2015. A Ficci India Day event is going ahead in Dublin on Aug 17.Indian community leaders met Ireland deputy PM Simon Harris on Monday after which he condemned the “despicable acts of violence and racism”.Chairman of the Ireland India Council Prashant Shukla told Ireland AM: “We weren’t worried about the event itself as the Gardaí assured us about safety, but we were worried about the perception it could lead to further attacks. Our message to the Irish community is that these attacks are attacks on your economy and industry. Policing needs to go to the next level. I feel there are not proper investigations and arrests. We are all working, paying taxes and contributing to the economy. No one is getting a free house. People are spreading misinformation that Indians buying houses is causing house prices to go up.”President of Ireland Michael D Higgins on Tuesday also condemned the attacks. “A lot of Indians are reconsidering their choices and may move back to India if the situation doesn’t improve. It is mostly being caused by far-right groups encouraging teenagers to attack immigrants. Indians are the most visible immigrants here,” said Indian national Some Aditya Mandal, who has worked in Dublin for eight years.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle10 baby names that mean creativity and visionLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?Maharashtra’s UNESCO World Heritage Sites and other iconic monuments for history loversRajinikanth completes 50 years in cinema: Lesser-known facts about the ‘Coolie’ star6 lizards that prove reptiles can be adorableHow to unrot your brain: 5 effective steps to sharpen focus and boost mental clarityFrom Mullum Malarum to Kabali: Rajinikanth’s most emotional movies that fans still cherish123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

Dr Ajay Aggarwal, an Indian-origin pain medicine doctor from Houston, has agreed to pay over $2 million to resolve allegations of medical fraud against him, the US Justice Department revealed. Between 2021 and 2023, the 63-year-old doctor billed federally funded health care programs like Medicare and the Department of Labor’s Workers’ Compensation Programs for surgical implants that he never performed. Dr Aggarwal received thousands of dollars per procedure, but patients received simple devices which required no surgery. And all device placements used to take place at Aggarwal's clinic, not a hospital or surgical center. “A doctor who uses simple medical devices on his patients, yet bills Medicare for a sophisticated spinal surgery, is billing the American taxpayer, plain and simple,” said US Attorney Nicholas J Ganjei.. “The Southern District of Texas will ensure that losses to federally funded healthcare programs from fraudulent billing, like what happened here, are recouped and that wrongdoers are held accountable.”PollDoes the healthcare billing system need stricter monitoring to prevent fraud?YesNoA 2023 document of the DOJ revealed that earlier he was accused of giving unnecessary treatment to federal employees with federal workers' compensation benefits and his pharmacy Medley, which was officially owned by his wife, filed the prescriptions. An employee of Medley acted as a whistleblower and said that during his term of employment, he saw patients being sent unnecessary with unnecessary medications being prescribed. In some cases, the patients did not even see or meet Dr Aggarwal. And Medley employees were allegedly instructed to auto-fill medications on a monthly basis and to use pre-printed prescription pads to submit the prescriptions to DOL-OWCP without consideration of medical need. The new fraud of Dr Aggarwal came to be reported at a time when foreign doctors are under fire, while several Republican leaders said US needs more doctors and foreign doctors can fill the gap.

Indian-origin foreign nationals holding an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card could now lose it if they face serious criminal charges or convictions, the government has announced.In a fresh gazette notification, the ministry of home affairs said that the OCI registration will be cancelled if the holder is sentenced to imprisonment for two years or more, or is named in a charge sheet for an offence carrying a jail term of seven years or more."In exercise of the powers conferred by the clause (da) of section 7D of the Citizenship Act, 1955 (57 of 1955), the central government hereby states that an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) registration shall be liable to get cancelled when a person has been sentenced to imprisonment for term of not less than two years or has been charge-sheeted for an offence entailing punishment of imprisonment for seven years or more," the notification said, as cited by PTI.PollShould stricter rules be applied to Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) cardholders?NoYesThe OCI card allows Indian-origin foreign nationals to visit India without a visa. The scheme, introduced in August 2005, enables registration as OCI for all persons of Indian origin who were citizens of India on January 26, 1950 or later, or were eligible to become citizens on that date, except for those who are, or have been, citizens of Pakistan, Bangladesh or any other country specified by the government in the official gazette.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Indian-origin Dr Vinay Prasad returns to FDA weeks after exit
Dr Vinay Prasad, previously ousted from his FDA vaccine chief position due to criticism from Laura Loomer over past anti-Trump comments and drug approval decisions, has been reinstated. This unusual move suggests the influence of RFK Jr within the Trump administration despite pressure from right-wing activists.

This unusual move suggests the influence of RFK Jr within the Trump administration despite pressure from right-wing activists. RFK Jr opposed anti-vaxxer Dr Prasad's exit and remained invested to bring him back.  Dr Vinay Prasad is back at his FDA job weeks after exit that was prompted by right-wing activist Laura Loomer's campaigning against Prasad. Dr Vinay Prasad, the Indian-origin vaccine chief of the FDA who was forced to resign in July after far-right activist Laura Loomer led a campaign against him, has been reinstated to his job in an unusual instance. Laura Loomer pointed out the critical comments that Dr Prasad made about President Donald Trump before joining the administration, while some of his decisions to deny drug approvals also came under fire. A Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson confirmed to the New York Times that Dr Prasad is returning to the agency. “At the F.D.A.’s request, Dr. Vinay Prasad is resuming leadership of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research,” Andrew Nixon, a health department spokesman, said in a statement.The NYT report observed that Dr Prasad's rehiring suggests that the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr., and the FDA commissioner, Dr Marty Makary, remain influential enough in the Trump administration to employ someone who had previously expressed disdain for Trump and his followers.Loomer reacted to the reinstatement and called in another "egregious personnel decision". "In another egregious personnel decision under the Trump administration, it is now being reported that longtime progressive Marxist Vinay Prasad who referred to President Trump’s supporters as criminals and compared them to drug addicts after saying he stabbed a Trump voodoo doll to “curse Trump” is apparently back at FDA," Loomer wrote.RFK Jr tapped Dr Prasad in May when the previous head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation left the role. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Dr Prasad gained prominence as an outspoken critic of vaccines and mask mandate. In his short stint at the FDA since May, Dr Prasad limited the use of Covid-19 vaccines and promoted warnings about a rare side effect of the vaccines. When he resigned from his role weeks ago, a department spokesperson told the NYT: "Dr. Prasad did not want to be a distraction to the great work of the FDA in the Trump administration and has decided to return to California and spend more time with his family."Kennedy, however, opposed Prasad's departure from the role and remained invested in bringing him back. Dr Prasad was born and brought up in Ohio and Chicago to Indian immigrant parents.

An Indian-origin techie, Manasi Mishra, who graduated with a computer science degree from Purdue University, revealed in a TikTok video as she was getting ready that the only company that called her for an interview was Chipotle. Titled 'Chipotle Interview GRWM', the TikTok video went viral as she appealed 'somebody pls hire me'. In an interview with New York Times, after the video went viral, Mishra revealed that growing up near Silicon Valley, she was used to the narrative that if she learned to code, worked hard and studied computer science, she could get a six-figure starting salary. But recent graduates are finding it hard because of the spread of AI programming tools and also the recent layoffs at companies like Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft.The NYT story confirmed that Mishra did not get the burrito-making gig at Chipotle, and she finally found a sales position job at a tech company.Mishra's story and the NYT article triggered a major debate on the present job situation, layoff and how much of it should be blamed on foreign workers, AI etc. "This is why I really do feel for Gen Z. This young woman was told her whole life by every authority figure that she should study hard, do well in school, and pursue a career in tech. She went to Purdue, one of the best engineering schools in the country. She studied computer science, not gender ideology or basket weaving," one viral comment read on X. "And still she could not even get a job at Chipotle let alone in her field. She did literally everything “right” but, to what end? This situation is not sustainable. H1B and other work visas, as well as offshoring, are getting out of control and abusive. Policymakers should care about the young generation," the person wrote. Many people commented that the jobs that the Indian-origin person missed must have gone to people from India who are on H-1B.

(Photo: DailyEcho/Padharo) Ankit Vaghela, an Indian-origin restaurant owner in Southampton, was told by the police that they could not come to his 'Padharo' when he called 999 to report a break-in. The vandals broke in and fled with several bottles of expensive alcohol and cash but the police helpline asked them to email the CCTV footage of the three burglars who broke in last week.Vaghela decided to get proactive and review the footage first. He discovered his cash register without the cash, abandoned along with some smashed liquor bottles strewn on a nearby road. “It was very heartbreaking to be told that officers will be able to review the damage in three to five working days and that no forensics was available at the time,” said Vaghela.“There was glass everywhere. As a business, we can’t afford to remain closed and had to get things cleaned up and the glass fixed. We are still struggling to operate smoothly without a proper cash register, which will take time, but are determined to welcome our guests with the same level of service we are known for in the city,” he said.The Hampshire Police said they did not underestimate the July 31 case but they understood that their investigation could start without their immediate attendance at the site, as the offenders were not there. “Every deployment decision is based on informed risk assessments to make sure the most serious cases are prioritised, and officers are on scene where there is an immediate threat to life or a crime in action,” the police force said in a statement.“On this occasion, based on the initial information we were given regarding the offenders no longer being at the scene, our investigation could get underway without any immediate attendance. That investigation is progressing with lines of enquiry identified, such as CCTV, and we are in touch with the victim to provide them updates on our investigation,” added the statement, along with an appeal to the public for any information related to the burglary."It means nothing now, the damage is done. Officers were not willing to visit the restaurant," Vaghela told to local news outlets.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

In a separate incident, Laxman Das, an Indian sous chef in Dublin, was attacked and robbed while going to work. These incidents follow a series of recent assaults targeting Indians in Ireland, raising concerns about racism.  TOI correspondent from London: A six-year-old Indian-origin girl and an Indian sous chef are the latest victims in the ongoing spate of racist attacks targeting Indian nationals and Indian-origin Irish people in Ireland.The girl, whose family hail from Kottayam, Kerala, was playing outside her house in Waterford City, southeast Ireland, with friends at 7.30pm on Monday evening when a gang of boys and one girl called her a “dirty Indian” and told her to “go back to India”. She was born in Ireland. Five of the gang also punched her in the face, hit her private parts with a bicycle, punched her neck and twisted her hair.Her mother moved to Ireland eight years ago from Kottayam to work as a nurse with her husband and recently became an Irish citizen.The mother said the gang was made up of boys aged 12 to 14 and a girl aged eight. She said her daughter came home in floods of tears and is now too scared to play outside. She told the Irish Mirror: “I never expected that such an incident would happen. I thought she would be safe here. Even in front of our own house she can’t play safely. I am a nurse, I am doing my best to take care of people. I do my work and I am 100% professional. I changed my citizenship, but still we are called dirty people and even my kids are not safe. We came here to fill a labour gap. We are professionals — we have all the certificates…”The mother studied BSc Nursing at University of Calicut and went to Mount Carmel Higher Secondary School in Kottayam.“Gardaí (Irish national police) responded to a report of an alleged assault in the Kilbarry area of Waterford city on the evening of Monday 4 August. Investigations are ongoing,” a Garda spokesperson told TOI.On Wednesday morning Laxman Das from Kolkata, who works as a sous chef at the Anantara The Marker Dublin hotel, was assaulted near the Hilton Hotel by three people while on his way to work. He was taken to St Vincent's University Hospital. His phone, cash and electric bike were stolen.These come following a spate of attacks against Indians in Ireland in recent weeks — on July 19, July 24, July 27, and on Aug 1 when a cab driver was assaulted.The Gardaí said they are still investigating these attacks and no one has been arrested.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning looks of Binny Sebastiantv10 baby names that mean ‘divine light’ or ‘sacred glow’Lifestyle10 Birds with the "wildest dating rituals"LifestyleRaksha Bandhan: 10 iconic lines of famous Hindi poets that capture essence of the festivalLifestyleKarishma Tanna Stuns with Style and SpiritEntertainmentFrom Moong to Chia Sprouts: How to grow your breakfast in balconyLifestyleBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Here’s how much each contestant earns dailytv10 creatures that survive in the deepest parts of the oceanLifestyleRaksha Bandhan: 10 quotes that describe the beautiful bond between brothers and sistersLifestyleHow to do step-by-step Ayurveda hair therapy at homeLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Threads of Love, Threads of Tradition: How different Indian states celebrate Raksha BandhanFrom chapatis to cake: 7 delicious ways to use overripe bananasInternational Cat Day 2025: From Persian to Bengal Cat-- 5 most beautiful and popular pet cat breeds in the world5 diseases moles on your body might indicate and should not be ignoredNot-so popular drinks that help in weightloss10 places in South Africa that aren’t to be missed in a lifetimeMemorable style outings of Princess CharlotteHow Kangana Ranaut turned fame into fearless politicsFrom ₹6 Lakh to ₹40 Lakh: A peek into Kamal Haasan’s ultra-luxe watch closetFrom Archana reacting to a hate comment to son Aaryamann revealing how he impressed girlfriend Yogita Bihani: Archana Puran Singh shares candid moments123Hot PicksGlobal Standard indexUS stocks todayIndia-US tariffIntel CEOMukesh AmbaniUS jobless dataRussia crude oilTop TrendingTom BradyDonald TrumpSouth Park EpisodeCall of DutyMalik BeasleyBattlefield 6 Beta OpensPrivate School in IndianaLuka Doncic Weight LossLinda McMahonLakers RumorsTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteUAE launches national programme to train Emiratis in space mission design and satellite engineering'PM Modi can't, shouldn't bend knee to Donald Trump': US tariffs on India draws rare bipartisan concern in US - watch'Enormous mistake': What Trump's former NSA John Bolton said on India tariffChild assault under false identity: Indian man commits suicide in US jail months after 35-year prison sentence, claim reportsLove gone wild: Indian man faces deportation for harassing UK zoo colleague for 6 months; didn’t stop even after restraining order'Before judging...': Wife of Pakistani man Salman Iftikhar who threatened Virgin Atlantic air hostess with gangrape defends outburstFriedrich Merz halts German military exports to Israel over Gaza issue; urges aid accessGround invasion in Gaza?

The arrest occurred due to possession of a fake resident card. Authorities took him into custody in Niagara Falls, New York. He faces a potential 10-year prison sentence. The arrest is part of 'Operation Take Back America'. This initiative targets illegal immigration.  An Indian national has been arrested in the United States for allegedly possessing a forged alien resident card, according to the Justice Department. Swapnil Ramesh Tejale, 34, was taken into custody following a traffic stop in Niagara Falls, New York, and now faces a federal charge that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.“On July 10, 2025, the Niagara Falls Border Patrol Station received a request from the Niagara Falls Police Department to help identify three individuals that they had encountered during a traffic stop,” said Assistant US Attorney Michael J. Smith, who is prosecuting the case. “Agents arrived at the scene and questioned the three individuals as to their citizenship. Tejale presented a Lawful Permanent Resident Card but voluntarily admitted that the card was fictitious.”Authorities later confirmed that Tejale was in the country unlawfully and did not possess any valid immigration documents. Following his arrest, agents discovered a Social Security card in his name, which was also found to be counterfeit.The case falls under “Operation Take Back America”, a Justice Department initiative aimed at tackling illegal immigration and dismantling transnational criminal organisations. The operation seeks to “repel the invasion of illegal immigration” and “protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime”, the department said.The investigation was led by the US Border Patrol Niagara Falls Station, under the direction of Patrol Agent in Charge Brady Waikal.Tejale’s arrest is part of a series of immigration enforcement actions involving Indian nationals this year. In a related incident, an Indian man from Santa Rosa, California, was sentenced in March to six months in prison for conspiracy to transport aliens for profit. Meanwhile, Manjot Singh, a 25-year-old Indian national, was recently arrested in the Seattle area for repeat offences including robbery, assault, and criminal impersonation. Singh, who entered the U.S. illegally, is currently in ICE custody pending deportation.ICE officials have said that Singh’s arrest is a warning to repeat offenders: “Those who violate US laws while in the country illegally face arrest and deportation.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Viral footage shows firefighters inspecting the scene as the family performed the ritual. (Photo: X) A housewarming ceremony involving a Hindu havan at a Texas home took an unexpected turn when local firefighters arrived at the scene, mistaking the ritual for a fire emergency.The incident was captured on video. The footage has gone viral and has fuelled an online debate over cultural awareness and fire safety. The clip was originally shared on Instagram. It shows a fire truck from the Bedford fire department pulling up outside the house as smoke from the ceremony fills the garage. Inside, an Indian family can be seen performing a traditional havan, a religious ritual involving fire, as part of their housewarming puja.The video includes on-screen text stating, "Cultural misunderstanding 101: A Hindu puja is not a fire emergency. When you're having a housewarming havan and the fire department pulls up."Shortly after the fire crew arrives, they are seen speaking with members of the family and inspecting the area. However, it remains unclear whether any formal action was taken or if any fire codes were violated during the ritual.The footage has since been widely circulated across social media platforms, with users offering differing views on the incident. Some social media users criticised the family for conducting a ritual involving fire in a residential setting, arguing it could pose safety risks. Others defended the family’s right to observe their religious customs, calling the incident a clear example of cultural misunderstanding.No official comment was immeditaely released by the Bedford fire department.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Indian-origin Mathura Sridharan was appointed as Ohio's 12th solicitor general, inviting the wrath of online trolls who questioned why a 'non-US-origin' person was not picked for the post. Sridharan's LinkedIn went viral as critics questioned her credibility -- forcing Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost to issue a clarification, or a clapback at the trolls. Dave Yost, who announced Mathura's promotion, said Mathura is wrongly being portrayed as a non-American. "A few commenters have asserted incorrectly that Mathura is not American. She is a United States citizen, married to a US citizen, and the child of naturalized US citizens," he said. "If her name or her complexion bother you, the problem is not with her or her appointment," he added."Mathura is brilliant… she won her argument at SCOTUS last year. Both the SGs she worked under (Flowers & Gaiser) recommended her. I told her when I originally hired her I needed her to argue with me. She does… All the time! Excited to promote her. She will serve Ohio well," Yost wrote.Yost's clapback also met trolling as people commented that she is not "American-American". "Is she a Christian? That’s the biggest factor that concerns me. Based on the bindi on her forehead, I worry she is not," one wrote. "Another American job… given away to foreigners," another wrote. "She's Indian. They all have a loyalty first to other Indians. horrible pick. Totally un-American. the GOP is pathetic," a third user wrote."No one with the last name 'Sridharan' fought in the US Civil War. She's not an American," another wrote.Before joining the Ohio Solicitor’s Office, Mathura clerked for Judge Steven J. Menashi of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and Judge Deborah A. Batts of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. She holds a Juris Doctor from New York University School of Law, a Master’s Degree in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as a Bachelor’s Degree in Economics and in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

News organizations like New Zealand Herald, Radio New Zealand, and 1News cited their inability to moderate the hateful content as the reason for shutting down comments.   After Indian-origin Nikhil Ravishankar was appointed as the new chief executive of Air New Zealand, the country's media said they had to disable comments on social media as there was a barrage of racist remarks targeting Ravishankar's ethnicity. Ravishankar was the chief digital officer of Air New Zealand before getting the major promotion which is the first for an Indian-origin person in the country.New Zealand Herald, Radio New Zealand, 1News said they had to disable comments as they can't allow hatred. The New Zealand Herald issued a statement in which it clarified that there were several racist comments owing to which they had to take the extreme step. "We appreciate the high level of interest in this story but cannot safely moderate it at this time," the news outlet said in a post in the comment thread."We want to foster a safe online community by reducing instances of hate, racism, abuse and misinformation. We welcome your feedback on articles but there has to be some parameters, and these are explained in our community house rules...We cannot tolerate hate. We cannot tolerate abuse towards individuals in our stories or other commenters," the company's social media policy says. Radio New Zealand had to do the same on the social media post on Ravishankar's appointment. "Under RNZ's comments policy, we will proactively disable comments on posts which may attract abusive or harmful comments or when resources are required elsewhere," a spokesperson for RNZ said. "In this instance, the comments were disabled after our monitoring found racist comments," the spokesperson said. "We want people to feel safe and respected on our community forums and will continue to proactively disable comments where necessary. We will not tolerate harmful communications."1News said it received a large number of comments on the post that announced Ravishankar's appointment and a vast majority were inappropriate. Who is Nikhil Ravishankar?Nikhil Ravishankar was born in India but brought up in New Zealand. He studied in New Zealand -- holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) from the University of Auckland. Before joining Air New Zealand, Ravishankar was Chief Digital Officer at Vector New Zealand (from 2017), and also worked as a Managing Director at Accenture across Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand, and in senior technology roles at Spark (formerly Telecom NZ).About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Who's Trisha Chatterjee? Indian-origin lawyer who said ICE gave her Taco Bell number
Trisha Chatterjee, an Ohio immigration lawyer, claims an ICE officer gave her a Taco Bell number instead of assistance with urgent client cases, sparking controversy.

After her TikTok video went viral, another ICE official offered help. Chatterjee highlights the broader issue of poor ICE communication, impacting immigrants facing detention and difficult bond policies, leading some to abandon their asylum claims. Trisha Chatterjee (Picture source: LinkedIn) Trisha Chatterjee, an Indian-origin immigration lawyer in Ohio, has alleged she was given the number of a Taco Bell outlet when she called ICE for urgent client support. Chatterjee posted about the incident on TikTok, where it went viral and ultimately led to help from another ICE official. But she says the larger issue lack of clear access to immigration authorities continues to cause serious harm to her clients."I called and they answered and they said, 'Hello, Taco Bell?' And I said, 'Taco Bell?' And the guy who was working said, 'Yeah, Taco Bell. Ma'am, you called me," Chatterjee recalled."I was in such disbelief," she said. "So, I called the ICE officer back, just really frustrated with what had just happened. He says, 'Oh, I'm sorry. I was trying to lighten the mood and make you laugh.'"ICE has denied the accusation. Homeland security called it a “lie and a smear.” Chatterjee stood by her version of events.Who is Trisha Chatterjee? Trisha Chatterjee is an Indian-origin immigration lawyer based in Greater Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio. She graduated from Miami University in 2020 and the University of Dayton School of Law in 2023.She works with the law office of Emily Feliz Garcia, a small immigration firm in Springdale. Before this, she worked at Abdallah law offices.For the last two years, she has handled immigration cases, especially those involving clients detained at the Butler County Jail in Ohio, which has a contract with ICE.Chatterjee was trying to submit "stay of removal" applications—urgent paperwork that can pause deportation for clients with pending immigration cases. ICE requires these to be submitted in person at the Detroit field office, but she hoped to file them locally in Blue Ash.After being unable to reach anyone by phone or email, she finally spoke to an ICE officer who gave her a phone number that turned out to be for Taco Bell. When she called back, the officer reportedly said he was trying to make her laugh.She posted a video about the incident on TikTok, which gained over 38,000 views. Many users sympathised, and one even helped her connect with a helpful ICE official in Blue Ash, who is now assisting her.Chatterjee said the larger problem is the lack of access and communication with ICE. She also highlighted how a stricter bond policy is making it harder for immigrants to stay out of detention during legal proceedings. Bonds can cost up to $50,000 and must be paid upfront.According to Chatterjee, some clients are abandoning their asylum cases or choosing to self-deport out of fear. She mentioned recent local arrests of people attending ICE check-ins, which has only deepened anxiety in immigrant communities.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The alleged abuse occurred in Contra Costa County, according to the district attorney’s office.Jennifer Powell, 45, has also been charged with 24 counts in a related felony complaint. Both Bhagwagar and Powell are being held at the Martinez detention facility. Bhagwagar’s bail has been set at $15 million.The charges in both cases carry possible prison terms of 15 years to life. Bhagwagar is expected to be arraigned Wednesday in Martinez, California.“Our office stands firmly committed to protecting children and holding those who cause harm accountable,” said Contra Costa county district attorney Diana Becton in a statement. “Every child deserves to feel safe, protected and heard when an injustice like this occurs.”According to the Contra Costa county sheriff’s office, detectives had been investigating Bhagwagar since April. His arrest was made with the assistance of Homeland Security Investigations after a warrant was issued.A short video published by aviation blog View From the Wing shows officers with badges exiting the plane’s cockpit.Delta Air Lines released a statement saying it was “appalled by reports of the charges related to the arrest” and confirmed that Bhagwagar had been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation. “Delta has zero tolerance for unlawful conduct,” the airline said.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani faces criticism for visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam due to his past support for defunding the police. Critics accuse Mamdani of shifting his stance for political gain, especially after his 2020 tweets resurfaced. Mamdani defends his actions, clarifying his current position on public safety and police funding. Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is facing backlash after visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam, as critics pointed to his past 2020 tweet supporting "defund the police" stance.The controversy erupted after Mamdani, who recently returned from a trip to Uganda, visited the grieving family of officer Islam, one of four victims killed in a mass shooting in Midtown Manhattan. Zohran Mamdani’s SECRET Wedding Triggers Fury Amid Local Tragedy | WATCHThe shooter, Shane Tamura, opened fire on Monday, killing Islam and three others before shooting himself.Sharing a post on X, Mamdani wrote: “Two days ago, an act of senseless violence took the lives of Officer Didarul Islam, Wesley LePatner, Aland Etienne, and Julia Hyman. Today, I visited Officer Islam's family and learned of his legacy. I ask you to join me in honoring the memory of these four New Yorkers.”However, the post quickly drew criticism, with users referencing Mamdani’s previous tweets during the height of the “Defund the Police” movement in 2020.Many accused him of changing his stance for political gain. One user wrote, “You can't go from defund the police to never mind I love the police. You're asking New Yorkers to forgo their guns meanwhile you just had a wedding in Uganda with armed guards.”While another posted, “Zohran Mamdani exposed as a total fraud. Mocking cops, calling them racist, then acting like he cares? No loyalty to America. He belongs in Uganda, not leading NYC. Deport him and protect our city!”Earlier at a press conference following his visit to the officer’s home in The Bronx, Mamdani addressed the criticism and attempted to clarify his position saying: “I am not defunding the police; I am not running to defund the police.”“Over the course of this race, I’ve been very clear about my view of public safety and the critical role that the police have in creating that public safety,” he added.Standing alongside members of the Bangladeshi American Police Association—of which Officer Islam was a member—and labor union 32BJ, which represented another victim, Aland Etienne, Mamdani tried to strike a unifying tone.During the peak of the "Defund the Police" movement in 2020, Zohran Mamdani repeatedly called for major cuts to the NYPD budget. In one post, he wrote, “We don’t need an investigation to know that the NYPD is racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety. What we need is to #DefundTheNYPD.”In another, he said, “There is no negotiating with an institution this wicked & corrupt. Defund it. Dismantle it. End the cycle of violence,” referencing budget talks around proposed NYPD cuts.Now, Mamdani has distanced himself from those remarks. When asked about them, he responded, “My statements in 2020 were made amidst a frustration that many New Yorkers held at the murder of George Floyd.”Mamdani claimed that his current stance is more nuanced, stating that his previous posts were “clearly out of step” with his recent campaign platform. He now supports maintaining the NYPD headcount while reducing its overtime budget.Despite this clarification, skepticism remains. Many police officers and political observers have accused Mamdani of shifting positions purely for political gain in a city where public safety remains a top concern for voters, New York Post reported.Adding to the political firestorm, former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams, who are both trailing Mamdani in early polling for the 2025 mayoral race, weighed in shortly after the shooting. Mamdani fired back, accusing Cuomo of politicising the tragedy saying, “It is beyond me that politicians are looking to use these days to score such cynical political points, on the very day that I held the father of Officer Islam in my arms and he could not utter a single word.”“For the former governor to spend an entire day speaking almost exclusively about me and barely about the New Yorkers who have been killed is indicative of the very politics New Yorkers want to leave in the past,” he added.All three, Mamdani, Cuomo, and Adams are expected to attend officer Islam’s funeral on Thursday.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The girl had visited Ramalingam’s store and returned later to buy ice cream. Prosecutors said he led her into a back area and forced her to perform oral sex. After the incident, the girl sought help from a passerby, who called the police.Ramalingam represented himself during the trial, which began on January 16. He was convicted on all charges on 7 July.“The fact that she had not run off after the first act of molest, or that she did not resist the assaults, or inform her grandfather, were all to my mind sufficiently explained, particularly given that she was still young and immature,” said Justice Aidan Xu, who found the girl’s account credible and consistent.Ramalingam’s earlier statements to police reportedly included admissions of hugging, kissing, and oral sex. However, he later denied any wrongdoing, claiming he was suffering from erectile dysfunction and that no DNA evidence was found on the victim.The judge ruled that these claims did not undermine the girl’s testimony. “While there was no dispute that Ramalingam suffered from erectile dysfunction, the prosecution’s expert witness gave a cogent explanation that oral rape remained possible,” Justice Xu was quoted as saying to Straits Times.Following sentencing on July 30, Ramalingam said he would appeal and was granted bail of S$80,000. He attempted to negotiate with the judge over the conditions, asking for the removal of his electronic tag and exemption from reporting to the Police Cantonment Complex. Both requests were denied.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Pushing boundaries: How six-hitting changed T20 cricket; India’s surge in the big-hit race
T20 cricket has undergone a six-hitting revolution, transforming batting from risk-averse accumulation to power-driven aggression. India, once lagging behind, now match the world’s best with a six every 12 balls in 2024. With IPL and internationals fuelling the trend, six-hitting is now the currency of modern T20 cricket.

India, once lagging behind, now match the world’s best with a six every 12 balls in 2024. With IPL and internationals fuelling the trend, six-hitting is now the currency of modern T20 cricket. Abhishek Sharma  (TOI) NEW DELHI: Abhishek Sharma's father Rajkumar Sharma used to get really annoyed while coaching him at the Gandhi Stadium in Amritsar. Sharma says he once got so miffed that he didn’t allow him to bat for a couple of days as punishment. In Delhi, Sanjay Bharadwaj, who has coached the likes of Gautam Gambhir, Amit Mishra, Joginder Sharma, and Unmukt Chand, scolded his NextGen ward Priyansh Arya for always looking to hit glory shots.The two southpaws are still hitting sixes for fun, but their intent forced their respective coaches to change their approach. "Priyansh added that new armoury in my coaching craft. His style of batting forced me to adapt," Bharadwaj told TimesofIndia.com after Priyansh scored a stunning 39-ball century against Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in IPL 2025. Asia Cup 2025: India Squad Announced | Surya Named Captain, Gill Vice-CaptainHitting a six was once a rarity in cricket; coaches often reprimanded players because playing in the ‘V’ was considered the correct way of batting. Today, if you want to find a place in T20 sides as a batter, the ability to clear the boundary at will is non-negotiable.The T20 format has also evolved since its inception almost two decades ago. Earlier, most teams followed the ODI template in T20Is -- exploit the powerplay, save wickets in the middle, and then go all guns blazing in the last five or six overs.But over time, the notion that T20s are just a shorter version of ODIs has been firmly discarded. The format has built its own identity, where hitting sixes and scoring at a higher strike rate form the very foundation of batting.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!With more and more data available, teams realised that scoring quickly is more valuable than preserving wickets at the cost of a slower scoring rate. As a result, line-ups were stacked with power-hitters in the middle order, and players capable of clearing the ropes at will were valued more than accumulators.The six-hitting revolutionConsider this: In 2025, Australia struck 92 sixes in just 8 T20Is, averaging one every 9.5 balls - the second-best six-hitting rate in a calendar year, behind only West Indies’ 157 sixes in 13 matches at 9.2 balls per six in 2023.In 2012, T20 matches saw a six once every 27 deliveries. Since then, the frequency has risen every year, with sixes becoming increasingly common. West Indies were the first big T20 team to crack this code: sixes are the real currency in T20s, the most efficient way to maximise value from each of the 120 deliveries.PollWho do you think is the best power-hitter in T20 cricket today?Abhishek SharmaSuryakumar YadavOther notable playersIn 2016, the T20 World Cup champion West Indies men’s team struck sixes every 16.3 balls against the top seven teams, compared to once every 22.5 balls by other sides in the top eight against each other.In the eight matches they played during the 2015-16 season, the Caribbeans hit 68 sixes in 938 balls faced -- a six every 13.79 deliveries.Where do India’s batters stand? Year / TournamentMatches/InningsBalls FacedSixes HitBalls per SixIndia T20Is 201544641142.18India T20Is 2020101,1626418.15India T20Is 202426287723612.19IPL 20216013,95268720.30IPL 20257316,5141,29412.76 In 2015, Indian batters used to clear the boundary once every 42.18 balls in four T20s -- just 11 sixes from 464 deliveries.But five years later, in 2020, the frequency improved drastically. They struck 64 sixes in 1,162 balls across 10 innings -- one every 18.15 balls.In 2024, the year India dominated world cricket by winning 24 out of 26 matches culminating in their T20 World Cup triumph, their six-hitting touched a whole new level. Across 26 outings, India hit a six every 12.19 balls.IPL stats highlight the same trend. In 2021, out of 13,952 balls faced, batters hit 687 sixes -- one every 20.3 balls.By contrast, IPL 2025 saw 1,294 sixes from 16,514 balls -- a stunning frequency of one every 12.76 balls.The age of power-hittersThe evolution of T20 cricket has been fuelled by the six-hitting revolution. With the arrival of T20 specialists like Abhishek Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav, the art of clearing the ropes has reached unprecedented levels.The fact that 10 wickets are available to be spent in 120 balls changes the dynamics of risk and reward in batting.As a result, batters who are exceptionally good at “hitting” (maximising runs per delivery) have become more valuable than traditional accumulators.We are far from the time when T20s resembled a shortened version of ODIs. The direction is clear: sixes will keep coming more frequently, scores will rise higher, and bowlers will be pushed further to the margins of the format, whether the guardians of cricket like it or not.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Curiously, neither Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli appear in the latest ODI Rankings, issued by ICC - cricket's global body. In the latest update, August 19, neither of India's ex-captains find a spot in the top-10 rankings.In last week's update, Rohit was in the No. 2 spot with 756 points while Kohli stood in the fourth place with 736 points. Now, Shubman Gill is the leading batter in ODI rankings with 784 rating points and Shreyas Iyer in sixth on 704 points. The other Indian in the top-20 places is KL Rahul in 13th with 638 points.Asia Cup 2025: India Squad Announced | Surya Named Captain, Gill Vice-CaptainIncidentally, Babar Azam, who had slipped to third in last week's rankings with Rohit taking over the second place, has now moved back beneath Gill.Latest ICC ODI Rankings, updated on August 19. (Image: ICC)Neither Rohit or Kohli have played any cricket since IPL 2025 while their last appearance in India's colours came in March in the Champions Trophy final against New Zealand.Do players disappear from the ICC Rankings?Yes. As per ICC's rules on rankings, a player can be removed from the top-100 spots if they've not played a match within the qualifying period - 12-15 months for Tests and 9-12 months for ODIs and T20Is.Alternatively, a player can be removed from the rankings for good if they retire from a format or completely from international cricket. ICC, in its rulebook, explains that when MS Dhoni retired from Tests in 2014, he was removed from the Test rankings, but remained in the ODI rankings.This is why Kohli and Rohit are not presented in the latest Test and T20I rankings considering they've bowed out from both formats. Both retired from the shortest format after winning the 2024 T20 World Cup and from Tests in May this year.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

R Ashwin criticized the management's decision, fearing Samson's exclusion. Agarkar deferred to the team management for the final XI, acknowledging both Gill and Samson's recent form, leaving Samson's place uncertain despite his performances. Sanju Samson  Shubman Gill's selection as vice-captain for the upcoming Asia Cup in the UAE has sparked discussions about Sanju Samson's position in India's T20 team, despite his inclusion in the squad. The order in which selection committee chairman Ajit Agarkar announced the team has led to speculation about the final playing XI, with Gill possibly opening alongside Abhishek Sharma in India's first match against Oman.Chief selector Ajit Agarkar's announcement sequence, naming Gill and Jitesh Sharma before Samson and Rinku Singh, has fueled speculation about team composition. This has raised questions about Samson's role, despite his recent success as an opener.India Asia Cup squad: Why Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill are biggest talking pointsThe batting order appears likely to feature Tilak Varma, Suryakumar Yadav, Shivam Dube, Hardik Pandya, and Axar Patel from positions three to seven. This arrangement leaves limited opportunities for Samson at the top order.Former India spinner R Ashwin has made a scathing attack on Team India's management for picking Shubman Gill in the side."They are thinking of Shubman Gill as the leader for the future. Maybe he can be the all-format captain. But it is not necessary to have the same captain in all formats,” Ashwin said on his YouTube channel "Ash Ki Baat."PollWho do you think should open the batting for India against Oman?Shubman GillAbhishek SharmaBoth of them“What is sadder is that you have announced Gill as the vice-captain, so Sanju Samson's place is also under threat. Sanju is not going to play. Shubman Gill will play, and he will open the batting,” he added. Agarkar addressed the selection matter by deferring to the team management's decision. "The captain-coach will take the call on the best balance for the team. Once we get to Dubai, we will have a bit more clarity. With more options available now, Shubman has been in great form for the last few months. So has Sanju, so two good options, along with Abhishek," he stated.Samson, who captains Rajasthan Royals in the IPL, now faces an uncertain wait before the Asia Cup begins, despite his recent performances.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

His elevation signals a strategic move by the BCCI, potentially positioning him as a future all-format captain and a key figure in Indian cricket's brand identity. Shubman Gill (PTI Photo)  The selection of Shubman Gill as vice-captain of India’s T20 team for the Asia Cup is neither a surprise nor out of place.Barring the 2024 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), when he didn’t play his full quota of matches and finished 12th among the top-scorers that year, Gill has either topped the batting charts in the T20 league in the remaining seasons over the last five years or has managed to figure in the top five. In fact, when he top scored in the 2023 edition with 870 runs, it was only second to the most number of runs ever scored by a batter in the IPL — 973 runs in 2016 by Virat Kohli. It was Gill’s season with the bat and the rest were merely spectators soaking it all in.India Asia Cup squad: Why Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill are biggest talking pointsThe kind of aggression, consistency, approach and leadership that Gill has managed to show in the last few years of the IPL — the single-biggest platform that allows the selectors to do their T20 math before putting together a good team — didn’t leave Ajit Agarkar and his team with much of a choice but to bring him in. In a squad of 15, there was no chance of leaving the man aside.But then there are those who might ask, why the vice-captaincy? Has Gill done enough to slip into the leadership role in the shortest format, or is it a natural extension of the role he’s acquired in Test cricket, where BCCI’s possibly indicating that he could be India’s future all-format captain? Is Gill set to follow MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma and be the fourth in line very soon?23 years and 146 days23 years and 146 days - Shubman Gill's age when he scored his only T20I hundred, against New Zealand in Ahmedabad on February 1, 2023, making him the youngest Indian to score hundreds in all three formats in international cricket.Well, now that we’ve concluded that his selection in the team is by no degree an unwarranted one, let’s move on to understanding why his elevation as vice-captain in not unwarranted either.Shubman Gill in IPL over the yearsYearMatNoRunsHSAvgBFSR10050Career11817386612939.452787138.72426202515265093*50.00417155.8806202412142610438.73289147.4012202317289012959.33564157.803420221624839634.50365132.330420211704785728.11402118.9003202014144070*33.84373117.960320191442967632.88238124.3603201813520357*33.83139146.0401As much as the sport derives traction from the field, there’s a lot that happens off it also that keeps the Indian cricket ticking — revenues, broadcast, sponsorships, fan engagement and more. Every now and then, when broadcast rights or sponsorship slots go on sale, the cricket board ends up burning the midnight oil trying to figure the right value.In any kind of value creation, only brand and consistency matter. From the days of Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid, to 2007 when India struck the T20 goldmine and MS Dhoni emerged, to 2015 onwards, when Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma singlehandedly moved the brand needle in Indian cricket to the next level — there’s always been a face that Indian cricket could identify with.PollWill Shubman Gill become the future all-format captain of India?DefinitelyPossiblyUnlikelyIn 2024, ‘who next?’ was the question that began to pop up inside BCCI boardrooms. It is in search of this space that the cricket board began identifying Shubman Gill. It wasn’t some random out-of-the-blue selection hunch that elevated him to Test captaincy earlier this year. It isn’t some random selection hunch that’s elevated him to T20 captaincy either.Tuesday’s selection had a massive future connotation to it.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

(AP Photo/Rajanish Kakade) Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh lambasted chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar for leaving out two “X-factor” players from India’s 15-member squad for the Asia Cup.“I feel that Siraj’s name should have been included as well. Siraj bowled very well in the recent series," Harbhajan said on his YouTube channel.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

The bowling unit would have seemed stronger. I feel that the ‘X-factor’ Siraj brings might be somewhat missed," he added.Another omission that surprised Harbhajan was the absence of Shreyas Iyer from the squad.“I had hoped he (Shreyas Iyer) would get a place in the team. He scored a lot of runs, played in the IPL final, and was in very good form."I thought his name could have been there. As for whose spot he would take, that is for the selectors to decide."When someone has to be included or left out, a spot is made. But I did not see Shreyas Iyer’s name there, which surprised me a little," he added.The Asia Cup will begin on September 9, with defending champions India set to face hosts United Arab Emirates a day later in Dubai in the eight-nation tournament.PollIs Shreyas Iyer's exclusion from the squad surprising?Absolutely surprisingNot surprising at allSomewhat surprisingI don't follow the team closelyIndia and arch-rivals Pakistan have been placed in Group A and will clash on September 14.Pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah has also made a comeback to the T20 squad after skipping two matches in England to manage his workload.Bumrah’s last T20 outing was India’s World Cup title win over South Africa at Barbados in June 2024.With Kohli and Rohit retiring from T20 internationals after that triumph, Bumrah will lead the pace attack alongside left-arm quick Arshdeep Singh and Harshit Rana.

Chopra believes this omission sends a negative signal regarding Iyer's T20I future. Shreyas Iyer (Image credit: ICC Photo) NEW DELHI: Former India opener Aakash Chopra has expressed surprise at Shreyas Iyer’s exclusion from the reserve players list for the upcoming Asia Cup, pointing out that it doesn’t send the right message regarding his T20I future.Iyer, who piled up 604 runs at a strike rate of 175 in IPL 2025 while leading Punjab Kings to the runners-up spot, had shown marked improvement against the short ball and dominated spinners throughout the tournament. Yet, he found no place in either the 15-member squad for the Asia Cup or the five-man reserves list.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!The omission had earlier baffled former India assistant coach Abhishek Nayar, and now Chopra has voiced similar concerns. "Shreyas' name is not even there in the five reserves, and that is surprising. It's understandable that you couldn't have him in the 15 as you can't play him in the XI, and you wanted lower-order batters as backup, where Shivam Dube is there, and Rinku Singh will be given another chance, which is absolutely par for the course."However, a place could have been created in the reserve players at least, where you have kept Dhruv Jurel, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Prasidh Krishna. Shreyas’ name could have been there, but you haven't kept it there either, and that doesn't send a great signal. The clarity in front of Shreyas' name is completely not there," Chopra said on his YouTube channel on Wednesday.At the same time, Chopra believes Iyer’s international future is far from over and that he still has a pathway to the 2026 Men’s T20 World Cup if he maintains strong performances in ODIs. For now, Iyer’s immediate focus will be on representing West Zone in the Duleep Trophy, which marks the start of the 2025/26 domestic season.India Asia Cup squad: Why Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill are biggest talking points"Shreyas Iyer not being there is a big story. What more will Shreyas Iyer have to do? What more can you do than what you have already done? You had a 600-plus run IPL season, took the team to the final, scored runs in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, played Ranji, and won the Champions Trophy. That's all you can do as a human being."This is the Asia Cup team. Don't attach the World Cup with it because there are 15 T20Is after this. The world changes in 15 T20Is. If he keeps scoring runs in ODIs, sooner or later, Shreyas Iyer will be part of the team. I have a strong feeling that Shreyas Iyer will be a part of India's T20 World Cup team," he added.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

India captain Shubman Gill speaks during a press conference at Edgbaston, Birmingham, England, Tuesday July 1, 2025. AP/PTI(AP07_01_2025_000278A) Legendary India cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has predicted that Shubman Gill might end up leading the team in T20Is as well, after the 25-year-old was elevated as the team’s vice-captain for the Asia Cup."Not surprising at all. He (Shubman Gill) scored over 750 runs just a couple of weeks ago," Gavaskar told India Today.India Asia Cup squad: Why Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill are biggest talking pointsGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"You cannot exclude a player in that kind of form. Also, he has done really well in the IPL, which concluded just before the tour to England."It's a very good inclusion. Giving him the vice-captaincy is also a way of telling him that in the future, he could be leading the T20 side. I think it’s a very, very good selection," he added."He was very impressive in England. To score 750-plus runs while leading the side for the first time shows how well he handled pressure."This vice-captaincy is a clear sign that he is going to be the captain of the Indian team as well.

Somebody has to miss out; that's just how it is in Indian cricket," he said."No point in discussing whether A or B or C should've been there. This is now our team. We can all have our opinions before the selection committee picks the team, but once the team is picked, we should back it fully."We shouldn't be saying A should've been there or B should've been there.

Shreyas Iyer (AP Photo) NEW DELHI: India’s cricket selectors sprung a surprise by leaving out Shreyas Iyer from both the 15-member Asia Cup squad and the five standby players, despite his strong showings in the Champions Trophy and IPL 2025. The announcement was made by BCCI chief selector Ajit Agarkar and T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav on Tuesday.Iyer enjoyed an excellent IPL season, guiding Punjab Kings to the final while amassing 604 runs in 17 matches at a strike rate of 175.07. He finished as the sixth-highest run-scorer of the tournament.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Former India assistant coach Abhishek Nayar voiced his disappointment at Iyer’s exclusion."I don't know, actually, I wanted to ask that question — aapke reserve players mein kaise nahi hai woh, if he is such a strong contender. Sometimes, you know, selection meetings can be quite interesting, and the discussions that happen in them can be very interesting," Nayar said on Star Sports.PollDo you agree with the exclusion of Shreyas Iyer from the Asia Cup squad?Yes, it was the right decision.No, he should have been included."But I can't fathom, and I don't understand, what reason can justify Shreyas Iyer not being part of that 20-member squad. I'm not even talking about the 15, I'm talking about the 20-member squad, which sends a message to Shreyas Iyer that he is not in the team's scheme of things. Because even if things don't work out, he is still not coming into the team. Either Riyan Parag is going to make the cut, or someone else is," he added."So, the big question here is that maybe they are not looking at him from a T20 point of view — or perhaps any other point of view. But I always say this that any selection after a while is, 'who you like a little more than the other'. In that regard, maybe Shreyas Iyer is not liked as much as someone else. Maybe."Chief selector Ajit Agarkar, meanwhile, addressed the calls regarding Iyer and Yashasvi Jaiswal."With regards to Shreyas, there's no fault of his — nor is it ours. It's just that we can only pick 15, and at the moment, he might have to wait for his chance," Agarkar explained."With regards to Yashasvi Jaiswal, it's just unfortunate again. Abhishek Sharma, with what he has done over the last few months — or a year or so that he has been with the team — plus the fact that he can bowl a little, gives us an option if required by the captain. One of these guys was always going to miss out. It's just unfortunate that Yashasvi might have to wait for his chance."Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Wasim Akram and Imran Khan  NEW DELHI: Pakistan pace legend Wasim Akram has opened up on what it was like to play under Imran Khan, calling the 1992 World Cup-winning skipper the greatest captain he ever played with. Akram, who began his international career in the mid-1980s, credited Imran for shaping him not only as a cricketer but also as a professional.Reflecting on his early days with Pakistan, Akram said much of his development came under Imran’s guidance. Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"I think whatever I did as a cricketer, off the field, on the field, credit goes to him. He used to give us a lot of confidence. He led from the front. He had a belief in his own ability. He was a hardworking cricketer," Akram said on Stick to Cricket.While many considered Imran a naturally gifted player, Akram stressed that his success was built on relentless effort. "People used to say I'm very naturally talented. Skipper wasn't talented. He worked hard. Remember he changed his bowling action. From 76, exactly. Changing even a little bit of action can take months, it might not happen. But he did change his action. He was so determined," Akram said.Akram emphasised that Imran’s determination and willingness to reinvent himself set an example for the entire team. His hard work, according to Akram, created a culture where no one could afford to be complacent. "I mean he was the best captain I played under. He used to give confidence to every one of us," Akram noted.PollWho do you believe is the greatest cricket captain in history?Imran KhanKapil DevSteve WaughClive LloydAt the same time, Imran was known to be tough on his players when required. Akram explained that the former skipper demanded full commitment on the field. "At times he used to shout at us because if you were lazy, fair enough. He was tough, but he was tough on the field. You give your 100%. If you don’t do well, he was okay with it," he said.However, Imran could not tolerate players who tried to shield themselves in pressure situations. "If you're trying to save yourself and say okay, it's a pressure situation, I’ll just take a back seat — he used to judge. He knew this particular player is just saving himself. So that used to annoy him a lot," Akram revealed.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

With Shubman Gill’s return, Sanju Samson’s fate has more or less been sealed. He will not feature in the playing XI now. You will not drop Tilak Varma or Hardik Pandya, which means Samson sits out and Jitesh Sharma will likely get the nod again. One thing is very clear from this selection, the batting slots have been prioritised over personalities. With Gill coming in as vice-captain, he will definitely play and open the batting. This essentially pushes Sanju Samson out of the XI,” Chopra said on JioHotstar.India Asia Cup squad press conference: What Ajit Agarkar, Surya said on shocking callsGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! The announcement of Gill as vice-captain has once again placed a question mark over Samson’s future in T20 internationals. Samson has been included in the squad, but Gill’s return has raised doubts about whether the Kerala batter will make the playing XI. The speculation has grown stronger after chief selector Ajit Agarkar read out the names in a particular order. Gill and Jitesh Sharma were mentioned first, while Samson and Rinku Singh were named towards the end. Many see this as an indication that Gill will open alongside Abhishek Sharma, while Jitesh may take the gloves and bat in the finisher’s role. With Tilak Varma, Suryakumar Yadav, Shivam Dube, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel expected to fill the middle-order positions, Samson’s opportunities look limited. Jitesh could also be preferred over Rinku Singh as a late-order pinch-hitter. Agarkar, however, played down the debate, saying the final XI would be decided by the captain and coach once the team reaches Dubai. “The captain-coach will take the call on the best balance for the team. Once we get to Dubai, we will have a bit more clarity. With more options available now, Shubman has been in great form for the last few months. So has Sanju, so two good options, along with Abhishek,” Agarkar said.PollWhich player seems most likely to take the gloves in the Asia Cup?Sanju SamsonJitesh Sharma Skipper Suryakumar Yadav added weight to Jitesh Sharma’s case, praising his transformation as a batter over the past year. “Post the last T20 World Cup, we spoke a lot on how to go about it. We said let’s not think of milestones ahead, follow your journey. He has been a completely different cricketer post that. The way he performed in the IPL and domestic tournaments, he has earned his spot again,” Surya said. The captain also defended the selection of pacer Harshit Rana, highlighting his consistency. “He has played really well in the IPL. In Pune, he came in as a concussion replacement and was Man of the Match in the last game he played for India. We back his skills, we know he can deliver,” Surya added. With both the chief selector and captain offering different signals, Samson faces another nervous wait. For now, his inclusion in the squad is not under question, but his place in the XI looks increasingly uncertain.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

The final decision on the wicketkeeper will depend on the team's batting strategy. Rishabh Pant of India (Photo by Gareth Copley/Getty Images) India will head into the Asia Cup 2025 without Rishabh Pant, who has been sidelined with a fractured foot. The wicketkeeper-batsman picked up the injury on the opening day of the fourth Test against England and was forced to return home, missing the fifth Test as well. Pant is now confirmed to miss both the Asia Cup and the upcoming home Test series against West Indies. Even before his injury, Pant was not in India’s immediate T20 plans. Sanju Samson has been the first-choice wicketkeeper in the format, with Pant last featuring in a T20 international against Sri Lanka in July 2024 at Pallekele. His absence has only further cemented Samson’s role behind the stumps, while Jitesh Sharma has been drafted in as the second wicketkeeping option.India Asia Cup squad press conference: What Ajit Agarkar, Surya said on shocking callsGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

He endured a forgettable IPL 2025 campaign, scoring just 269 runs at an average of 24.45 and a strike rate of 133.17.

While Samson has consistently opened with Abhishek Sharma for India, the return of vice-captain Shubman Gill could push him down the order. If that happens, Jitesh’s power-hitting skills in the middle and lower order could come into play.

Suryakumar continues as captain, with Shubman Gill promoted to vice-captain. The squad retains a strong core from the England series: Abhishek, Tilak, Hardik, Dube, Axar, Rinku, Samson, and Varun are all present. However, there are some notable changes. Veteran pacer Mohammed Shami, who starred against England, is missing. Instead, Jasprit Bumrah returns to the T20I setup after workload management kept him out for much of the England tour. Young quick Harshit Rana has also been drafted in, offering fresh pace options alongside Arshdeep Singh.On the spin front, Kuldeep Yadav comes in, strengthening India’s variety, while Bishnoi drops out. The wicketkeeping department sees Samson retained, but Jitesh Sharma is added as a second option, giving the side more flexibility in finishing roles. Shubman Gill, absent from the last T20I, not only returns but takes up leadership responsibility, signalling the selectors’ long-term trust in him. The biggest talking points are the omissions of Shreyas Iyer and Yashasvi Jaiswal, both overlooked despite good domestic and IPL form. Chief selector Ajit Agarkar explained that competition for places, particularly in the middle order, forced tough calls.India squad for Asia Cup 2025: Surya Kumar Yadav (c), Shubman Gill (vc), Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Jitesh Sharma (WK), Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, Varun Chakaravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Sanju Samson (wk), Harshit Rana, Rinku Singh.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Pushing boundaries: How six-hitting changed T20 cricket; India’s surge in the big-hit race
T20 cricket has undergone a six-hitting revolution, transforming batting from risk-averse accumulation to power-driven aggression. India, once lagging behind, now match the world’s best with a six every 12 balls in 2024. With IPL and internationals fuelling the trend, six-hitting is now the currency of modern T20 cricket.

India, once lagging behind, now match the world’s best with a six every 12 balls in 2024. With IPL and internationals fuelling the trend, six-hitting is now the currency of modern T20 cricket. Abhishek Sharma  (TOI) NEW DELHI: Abhishek Sharma's father Rajkumar Sharma used to get really annoyed while coaching him at the Gandhi Stadium in Amritsar. Sharma says he once got so miffed that he didn’t allow him to bat for a couple of days as punishment. In Delhi, Sanjay Bharadwaj, who has coached the likes of Gautam Gambhir, Amit Mishra, Joginder Sharma, and Unmukt Chand, scolded his NextGen ward Priyansh Arya for always looking to hit glory shots.The two southpaws are still hitting sixes for fun, but their intent forced their respective coaches to change their approach. "Priyansh added that new armoury in my coaching craft. His style of batting forced me to adapt," Bharadwaj told TimesofIndia.com after Priyansh scored a stunning 39-ball century against Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in IPL 2025. Asia Cup 2025: India Squad Announced | Surya Named Captain, Gill Vice-CaptainHitting a six was once a rarity in cricket; coaches often reprimanded players because playing in the ‘V’ was considered the correct way of batting. Today, if you want to find a place in T20 sides as a batter, the ability to clear the boundary at will is non-negotiable.The T20 format has also evolved since its inception almost two decades ago. Earlier, most teams followed the ODI template in T20Is -- exploit the powerplay, save wickets in the middle, and then go all guns blazing in the last five or six overs.But over time, the notion that T20s are just a shorter version of ODIs has been firmly discarded. The format has built its own identity, where hitting sixes and scoring at a higher strike rate form the very foundation of batting.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!With more and more data available, teams realised that scoring quickly is more valuable than preserving wickets at the cost of a slower scoring rate. As a result, line-ups were stacked with power-hitters in the middle order, and players capable of clearing the ropes at will were valued more than accumulators.The six-hitting revolutionConsider this: In 2025, Australia struck 92 sixes in just 8 T20Is, averaging one every 9.5 balls - the second-best six-hitting rate in a calendar year, behind only West Indies’ 157 sixes in 13 matches at 9.2 balls per six in 2023.In 2012, T20 matches saw a six once every 27 deliveries. Since then, the frequency has risen every year, with sixes becoming increasingly common. West Indies were the first big T20 team to crack this code: sixes are the real currency in T20s, the most efficient way to maximise value from each of the 120 deliveries.PollWho do you think is the best power-hitter in T20 cricket today?Abhishek SharmaSuryakumar YadavOther notable playersIn 2016, the T20 World Cup champion West Indies men’s team struck sixes every 16.3 balls against the top seven teams, compared to once every 22.5 balls by other sides in the top eight against each other.In the eight matches they played during the 2015-16 season, the Caribbeans hit 68 sixes in 938 balls faced -- a six every 13.79 deliveries.Where do India’s batters stand?

They struck 64 sixes in 1,162 balls across 10 innings -- one every 18.15 balls.In 2024, the year India dominated world cricket by winning 24 out of 26 matches culminating in their T20 World Cup triumph, their six-hitting touched a whole new level. Across 26 outings, India hit a six every 12.19 balls.IPL stats highlight the same trend. In 2021, out of 13,952 balls faced, batters hit 687 sixes -- one every 20.3 balls.By contrast, IPL 2025 saw 1,294 sixes from 16,514 balls -- a stunning frequency of one every 12.76 balls.The age of power-hittersThe evolution of T20 cricket has been fuelled by the six-hitting revolution. With the arrival of T20 specialists like Abhishek Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav, the art of clearing the ropes has reached unprecedented levels.The fact that 10 wickets are available to be spent in 120 balls changes the dynamics of risk and reward in batting.As a result, batters who are exceptionally good at “hitting” (maximising runs per delivery) have become more valuable than traditional accumulators.We are far from the time when T20s resembled a shortened version of ODIs. The direction is clear: sixes will keep coming more frequently, scores will rise higher, and bowlers will be pushed further to the margins of the format, whether the guardians of cricket like it or not.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

R Ashwin criticized the management's decision, fearing Samson's exclusion. Agarkar deferred to the team management for the final XI, acknowledging both Gill and Samson's recent form, leaving Samson's place uncertain despite his performances. Sanju Samson  Shubman Gill's selection as vice-captain for the upcoming Asia Cup in the UAE has sparked discussions about Sanju Samson's position in India's T20 team, despite his inclusion in the squad. The order in which selection committee chairman Ajit Agarkar announced the team has led to speculation about the final playing XI, with Gill possibly opening alongside Abhishek Sharma in India's first match against Oman.Chief selector Ajit Agarkar's announcement sequence, naming Gill and Jitesh Sharma before Samson and Rinku Singh, has fueled speculation about team composition. This has raised questions about Samson's role, despite his recent success as an opener.India Asia Cup squad: Why Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill are biggest talking pointsThe batting order appears likely to feature Tilak Varma, Suryakumar Yadav, Shivam Dube, Hardik Pandya, and Axar Patel from positions three to seven. This arrangement leaves limited opportunities for Samson at the top order.Former India spinner R Ashwin has made a scathing attack on Team India's management for picking Shubman Gill in the side."They are thinking of Shubman Gill as the leader for the future. Maybe he can be the all-format captain. But it is not necessary to have the same captain in all formats,” Ashwin said on his YouTube channel "Ash Ki Baat."PollWho do you think should open the batting for India against Oman?Shubman GillAbhishek SharmaBoth of them“What is sadder is that you have announced Gill as the vice-captain, so Sanju Samson's place is also under threat. Sanju is not going to play. Shubman Gill will play, and he will open the batting,” he added. Agarkar addressed the selection matter by deferring to the team management's decision. "The captain-coach will take the call on the best balance for the team. Once we get to Dubai, we will have a bit more clarity. With more options available now, Shubman has been in great form for the last few months. So has Sanju, so two good options, along with Abhishek," he stated.Samson, who captains Rajasthan Royals in the IPL, now faces an uncertain wait before the Asia Cup begins, despite his recent performances.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Curiously, neither Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli appear in the latest ODI Rankings, issued by ICC - cricket's global body. In the latest update, August 19, neither of India's ex-captains find a spot in the top-10 rankings.In last week's update, Rohit was in the No. 2 spot with 756 points while Kohli stood in the fourth place with 736 points. Now, Shubman Gill is the leading batter in ODI rankings with 784 rating points and Shreyas Iyer in sixth on 704 points. The other Indian in the top-20 places is KL Rahul in 13th with 638 points.Asia Cup 2025: India Squad Announced | Surya Named Captain, Gill Vice-CaptainIncidentally, Babar Azam, who had slipped to third in last week's rankings with Rohit taking over the second place, has now moved back beneath Gill.Latest ICC ODI Rankings, updated on August 19. (Image: ICC)Neither Rohit or Kohli have played any cricket since IPL 2025 while their last appearance in India's colours came in March in the Champions Trophy final against New Zealand.Do players disappear from the ICC Rankings?Yes. As per ICC's rules on rankings, a player can be removed from the top-100 spots if they've not played a match within the qualifying period - 12-15 months for Tests and 9-12 months for ODIs and T20Is.Alternatively, a player can be removed from the rankings for good if they retire from a format or completely from international cricket. ICC, in its rulebook, explains that when MS Dhoni retired from Tests in 2014, he was removed from the Test rankings, but remained in the ODI rankings.This is why Kohli and Rohit are not presented in the latest Test and T20I rankings considering they've bowed out from both formats. Both retired from the shortest format after winning the 2024 T20 World Cup and from Tests in May this year.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Shubman Gill's selection as T20 vice-captain for the Asia Cup reflects his consistent IPL performance and leadership qualities, solidifying his place in the squad.

His elevation signals a strategic move by the BCCI, potentially positioning him as a future all-format captain and a key figure in Indian cricket's brand identity. Shubman Gill (PTI Photo)  The selection of Shubman Gill as vice-captain of India’s T20 team for the Asia Cup is neither a surprise nor out of place.Barring the 2024 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), when he didn’t play his full quota of matches and finished 12th among the top-scorers that year, Gill has either topped the batting charts in the T20 league in the remaining seasons over the last five years or has managed to figure in the top five. In fact, when he top scored in the 2023 edition with 870 runs, it was only second to the most number of runs ever scored by a batter in the IPL — 973 runs in 2016 by Virat Kohli. It was Gill’s season with the bat and the rest were merely spectators soaking it all in.India Asia Cup squad: Why Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill are biggest talking pointsThe kind of aggression, consistency, approach and leadership that Gill has managed to show in the last few years of the IPL — the single-biggest platform that allows the selectors to do their T20 math before putting together a good team — didn’t leave Ajit Agarkar and his team with much of a choice but to bring him in. In a squad of 15, there was no chance of leaving the man aside.But then there are those who might ask, why the vice-captaincy? Has Gill done enough to slip into the leadership role in the shortest format, or is it a natural extension of the role he’s acquired in Test cricket, where BCCI’s possibly indicating that he could be India’s future all-format captain? Is Gill set to follow MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma and be the fourth in line very soon?23 years and 146 days23 years and 146 days - Shubman Gill's age when he scored his only T20I hundred, against New Zealand in Ahmedabad on February 1, 2023, making him the youngest Indian to score hundreds in all three formats in international cricket.Well, now that we’ve concluded that his selection in the team is by no degree an unwarranted one, let’s move on to understanding why his elevation as vice-captain in not unwarranted either.Shubman Gill in IPL over the yearsYearMatNoRunsHSAvgBFSR10050Career11817386612939.452787138.72426202515265093*50.00417155.8806202412142610438.73289147.4012202317289012959.33564157.803420221624839634.50365132.330420211704785728.11402118.9003202014144070*33.84373117.960320191442967632.88238124.3603201813520357*33.83139146.0401As much as the sport derives traction from the field, there’s a lot that happens off it also that keeps the Indian cricket ticking — revenues, broadcast, sponsorships, fan engagement and more. Every now and then, when broadcast rights or sponsorship slots go on sale, the cricket board ends up burning the midnight oil trying to figure the right value.In any kind of value creation, only brand and consistency matter. From the days of Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid, to 2007 when India struck the T20 goldmine and MS Dhoni emerged, to 2015 onwards, when Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma singlehandedly moved the brand needle in Indian cricket to the next level — there’s always been a face that Indian cricket could identify with.PollWill Shubman Gill become the future all-format captain of India?DefinitelyPossiblyUnlikelyIn 2024, ‘who next?’ was the question that began to pop up inside BCCI boardrooms. It is in search of this space that the cricket board began identifying Shubman Gill. It wasn’t some random out-of-the-blue selection hunch that elevated him to Test captaincy earlier this year. It isn’t some random selection hunch that’s elevated him to T20 captaincy either.Tuesday’s selection had a massive future connotation to it.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

(AP Photo/Rajanish Kakade) Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh lambasted chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar for leaving out two “X-factor” players from India’s 15-member squad for the Asia Cup.“I feel that Siraj’s name should have been included as well. Siraj bowled very well in the recent series," Harbhajan said on his YouTube channel.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

The bowling unit would have seemed stronger. I feel that the ‘X-factor’ Siraj brings might be somewhat missed," he added.Another omission that surprised Harbhajan was the absence of Shreyas Iyer from the squad.“I had hoped he (Shreyas Iyer) would get a place in the team. He scored a lot of runs, played in the IPL final, and was in very good form."I thought his name could have been there. As for whose spot he would take, that is for the selectors to decide."When someone has to be included or left out, a spot is made. But I did not see Shreyas Iyer’s name there, which surprised me a little," he added.The Asia Cup will begin on September 9, with defending champions India set to face hosts United Arab Emirates a day later in Dubai in the eight-nation tournament.PollIs Shreyas Iyer's exclusion from the squad surprising?Absolutely surprisingNot surprising at allSomewhat surprisingI don't follow the team closelyIndia and arch-rivals Pakistan have been placed in Group A and will clash on September 14.Pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah has also made a comeback to the T20 squad after skipping two matches in England to manage his workload.Bumrah’s last T20 outing was India’s World Cup title win over South Africa at Barbados in June 2024.With Kohli and Rohit retiring from T20 internationals after that triumph, Bumrah will lead the pace attack alongside left-arm quick Arshdeep Singh and Harshit Rana.

Chopra believes this omission sends a negative signal regarding Iyer's T20I future. Shreyas Iyer (Image credit: ICC Photo) NEW DELHI: Former India opener Aakash Chopra has expressed surprise at Shreyas Iyer’s exclusion from the reserve players list for the upcoming Asia Cup, pointing out that it doesn’t send the right message regarding his T20I future.Iyer, who piled up 604 runs at a strike rate of 175 in IPL 2025 while leading Punjab Kings to the runners-up spot, had shown marked improvement against the short ball and dominated spinners throughout the tournament. Yet, he found no place in either the 15-member squad for the Asia Cup or the five-man reserves list.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!The omission had earlier baffled former India assistant coach Abhishek Nayar, and now Chopra has voiced similar concerns. "Shreyas' name is not even there in the five reserves, and that is surprising. It's understandable that you couldn't have him in the 15 as you can't play him in the XI, and you wanted lower-order batters as backup, where Shivam Dube is there, and Rinku Singh will be given another chance, which is absolutely par for the course."However, a place could have been created in the reserve players at least, where you have kept Dhruv Jurel, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Prasidh Krishna. Shreyas’ name could have been there, but you haven't kept it there either, and that doesn't send a great signal. The clarity in front of Shreyas' name is completely not there," Chopra said on his YouTube channel on Wednesday.At the same time, Chopra believes Iyer’s international future is far from over and that he still has a pathway to the 2026 Men’s T20 World Cup if he maintains strong performances in ODIs. For now, Iyer’s immediate focus will be on representing West Zone in the Duleep Trophy, which marks the start of the 2025/26 domestic season.India Asia Cup squad: Why Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill are biggest talking points"Shreyas Iyer not being there is a big story. What more will Shreyas Iyer have to do? What more can you do than what you have already done? You had a 600-plus run IPL season, took the team to the final, scored runs in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, played Ranji, and won the Champions Trophy. That's all you can do as a human being."This is the Asia Cup team. Don't attach the World Cup with it because there are 15 T20Is after this. The world changes in 15 T20Is. If he keeps scoring runs in ODIs, sooner or later, Shreyas Iyer will be part of the team. I have a strong feeling that Shreyas Iyer will be a part of India's T20 World Cup team," he added.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Shreyas Iyer (AP Photo) NEW DELHI: India’s cricket selectors sprung a surprise by leaving out Shreyas Iyer from both the 15-member Asia Cup squad and the five standby players, despite his strong showings in the Champions Trophy and IPL 2025. The announcement was made by BCCI chief selector Ajit Agarkar and T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav on Tuesday.Iyer enjoyed an excellent IPL season, guiding Punjab Kings to the final while amassing 604 runs in 17 matches at a strike rate of 175.07. He finished as the sixth-highest run-scorer of the tournament.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Former India assistant coach Abhishek Nayar voiced his disappointment at Iyer’s exclusion."I don't know, actually, I wanted to ask that question — aapke reserve players mein kaise nahi hai woh, if he is such a strong contender. Sometimes, you know, selection meetings can be quite interesting, and the discussions that happen in them can be very interesting," Nayar said on Star Sports.PollDo you agree with the exclusion of Shreyas Iyer from the Asia Cup squad?Yes, it was the right decision.No, he should have been included."But I can't fathom, and I don't understand, what reason can justify Shreyas Iyer not being part of that 20-member squad. I'm not even talking about the 15, I'm talking about the 20-member squad, which sends a message to Shreyas Iyer that he is not in the team's scheme of things. Because even if things don't work out, he is still not coming into the team. Either Riyan Parag is going to make the cut, or someone else is," he added."So, the big question here is that maybe they are not looking at him from a T20 point of view — or perhaps any other point of view. But I always say this that any selection after a while is, 'who you like a little more than the other'. In that regard, maybe Shreyas Iyer is not liked as much as someone else. Maybe."Chief selector Ajit Agarkar, meanwhile, addressed the calls regarding Iyer and Yashasvi Jaiswal."With regards to Shreyas, there's no fault of his — nor is it ours. It's just that we can only pick 15, and at the moment, he might have to wait for his chance," Agarkar explained."With regards to Yashasvi Jaiswal, it's just unfortunate again. Abhishek Sharma, with what he has done over the last few months — or a year or so that he has been with the team — plus the fact that he can bowl a little, gives us an option if required by the captain. One of these guys was always going to miss out. It's just unfortunate that Yashasvi might have to wait for his chance."Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

I think it’s a very, very good selection," he added."He was very impressive in England. To score 750-plus runs while leading the side for the first time shows how well he handled pressure."This vice-captaincy is a clear sign that he is going to be the captain of the Indian team as well.

We can all have our opinions before the selection committee picks the team, but once the team is picked, we should back it fully."We shouldn't be saying A should've been there or B should've been there.

Akram, who began his international career in the mid-1980s, credited Imran for shaping him not only as a cricketer but also as a professional.Reflecting on his early days with Pakistan, Akram said much of his development came under Imran’s guidance. Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"I think whatever I did as a cricketer, off the field, on the field, credit goes to him. He used to give us a lot of confidence. He led from the front. He had a belief in his own ability. He was a hardworking cricketer," Akram said on Stick to Cricket.While many considered Imran a naturally gifted player, Akram stressed that his success was built on relentless effort. "People used to say I'm very naturally talented. Skipper wasn't talented. He worked hard. Remember he changed his bowling action. From 76, exactly. Changing even a little bit of action can take months, it might not happen. But he did change his action. He was so determined," Akram said.Akram emphasised that Imran’s determination and willingness to reinvent himself set an example for the entire team. His hard work, according to Akram, created a culture where no one could afford to be complacent. "I mean he was the best captain I played under. He used to give confidence to every one of us," Akram noted.PollWho do you believe is the greatest cricket captain in history?Imran KhanKapil DevSteve WaughClive LloydAt the same time, Imran was known to be tough on his players when required. Akram explained that the former skipper demanded full commitment on the field. "At times he used to shout at us because if you were lazy, fair enough. He was tough, but he was tough on the field. You give your 100%. If you don’t do well, he was okay with it," he said.However, Imran could not tolerate players who tried to shield themselves in pressure situations. "If you're trying to save yourself and say okay, it's a pressure situation, I’ll just take a back seat — he used to judge. He knew this particular player is just saving himself.

The Swedish international, who has not played in pre-season or Newcastle's opening game, expressed his frustration over broken promises and lost trust through an Instagram post on Tuesday.Liverpool's reported £110 million bid for the 25-year-old striker was rejected by Newcastle, who are demanding a British transfer record fee of up to £150 million.Isak chose not to attend the Professional Footballers' Association awards ceremony despite being named in the Premier League 2024/25 team of the year.Alexander Isak's Instagram Story on his desired move out of Newcastle United."I've kept quiet for a long time while others have spoken. That silence has allowed people to push their own version of events, even though they know it doesn't reflect what was really said and agreed behind closed doors," Isak posted on Instagram. "The reality is that promises were made and the club has known my position for a long time. To now act as if these issues are only emerging is misleading. When promises are broken and trust is lost, the relationship can't continue. That's where things are for me right now - and why change is in the best interests of everyone, not just myself."Reports suggest Newcastle had promised Isak an improved contract but delayed due to financial sustainability rules.Newcastle responded with their own statement expressing disappointment at Isak's social media post.Statement by Newcastle United in response to Alexander Isak's social media post."We are disappointed to have been alerted to a social media post by Alexander Isak this evening," the club stated. "We are clear in response that Alex remains under contract and that no commitment has ever been made by a club official that Alex can leave Newcastle United this summer. We want to keep our best players, but we also understand players have their own wishes and we listen to their views."The club added that Isak remains part of their family and would be welcomed back when ready to rejoin his teammates.Since joining from Real Sociedad in 2022, Isak has scored 62 goals in 109 appearances for Newcastle, including the winning goal against Liverpool in the League Cup final that ended Newcastle's 70-year trophy drought.Liverpool have already invested £300 million in squad improvements this season while recouping over £200 million through sales.The Merseyside club is seeking attacking reinforcements following the departures of Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez, and the tragic death of Diogo Jota.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Asia Cup: Shubman Gill is breathing down Suryakumar Yadav's neck
Shubman Gill's elevation to India's T20I vice-captain is a clear sign that he might end up leading the team instead of Suryakumar Yadav in the T20I World Cup at home. There are still seven months to go to the marquee event, and in Indian cricket, things can change in seven hours.

There are still seven months to go to the marquee event, and in Indian cricket, things can change in seven hours. Shubman Gill and Suryakumar Yadav New Delhi: At the start of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, keyboard warriors had written off Shubman Gill before he could even take strike. His 754 runs in the Test series and series-levelling captaincy, as chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar rightly mentioned, "exceeded expectations." And Gill's elevation to India's T20I vice-captaincy is no fluke.Remember the India tour of Zimbabwe in 2024, which happened right after India's title triumph in the USA and Caribbean? Gill was the captain of the young Indian team, and the signs were clear that the selectors wanted him in the leadership role. Two years ago, he got the captaincy of Gujarat Titans (GT) in the Indian Premier League (IPL). In his second season, he led his team to the playoffs and then the gruelling five-match Test series in England, where he further stamped his authority.India Asia Cup squad press conference: What Ajit Agarkar, Surya said on shocking callsGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!In Indian cricket, a lot can happen in seven hours, let alone the seven months to the T20 World Cup. Shubman was labelled a misfit for T20Is, and here he is going to the Asia Cup as deputy to Suryakumar Yadav, and it makes sense he could lead the team in the 2026 T20I World Cup.Is Gill breathing down Surya's neck? The simple answer is yes.Suryakumar Yadav is still recovering from the sports hernia surgery, and TimesofIndia.com has learnt that he is not yet 100 per cent fit. The selectors have taken a gamble that he will regain his full fitness by the time the Asia Cup kicks off in the UAE next month.Surya is also not getting any younger, and in the middle of the Asia Cup, he would turn 35. This is Surya's third surgery in as many years. After an ankle surgery in 2023, the swashbuckling batter had previously undergone the same sports hernia surgery back in 2024. The recurring injuries has ended careers, and we know what happened with Bhuvneshwar Kumar.Management's back-upChief selector Ajit Agarkar has hinted that Shubman Gill is someone they are looking forward to as a captain across formats.“In both T20 cricket (IPL) and Test cricket Gill is already leading. He was also the vice-captain the last time he played in T20Is. We do see leadership qualities in him, and he showed his quality by exceeding expectations with the bat in England (during the Test series),” Agarkar told reporters on Tuesday.PollDo you think Shubman Gill has proven himself as a leader in the Indian cricket team?Yes, absolutely!Not yet, still needs to prove more.Why is Shubman the right pick?Since the time Gambhir took over the coaching role after India won the T20 World Cup, he has set a template, where he has created room for the IPL generation to take over. Since then, India's batting has reached new heights. A team that prioritises quick scoring and batting depth was able to routinely break the 250-run barrier. They went as high as 297 against Bangladesh in October 2024, which is the third-highest total in T20Is.Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson are pivotal to coach Gambhir's template. But they are a high-risk, high-reward kind of opening pair. Gambhir would not want, in a final, India to be 0/2. Shubman's inclusion will most certainly provide stability at one end, with his roommate since U-14 days, Abhishek Sharma, having the luxury to attack right from the outset.Filling big voidWith Shubman Gill, India have found a suitable face to fill the big void left by Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. With his elegant strokeplay, calm demeanour, and youthful appeal, he has already become a fan favourite and with the advertisers.Suryakumar Yadav has had an impressive track record as India’s full-time T20I captain after Rohit Sharma retired from the format following the 2024 T20 World Cup triumph. Under his leadership, India have won 17 out of 22 matches.There is no question about Surya the T20I batter -- he can entertain the crowd. But can he fill stadiums?

Arunachal Pradesh secured a narrow victory in the opening match, setting a promising tone for the tournament, nurturing young football talent.  Football meets shooting on rain-soaked evening in Subroto Cup (Special Arrangements)  NEW DELHI: Under ominous black clouds casting their spell over Delhi’s skyline, the Subroto Cup, India's oldest national school football tournament, roared to life with its 64th edition at the Ambedkar Stadium on Tuesday. Despite heavy rain in the morning hours of the day, leaving carpets soaked and the turf damp, hundreds of students and army officers in the stands cheered on to undo the damage dealt by the weather. Olympian and Arjuna Award-winning shooter Anjum Moudgil, the guest of honour for the opening ceremony, drew an exciting comparison between team sports like football and something deeply individual like shooting. While shooting remains less accessible compared to team sports like football in India, she said that individual sports are more lucrative than playing for a team. Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!That difference, she said, lies at the heart of how recognition comes to athletes. “Yes, they are different in terms of recognition. When you win a medal, obviously you get more attention than a team,” she told TimesofIndia.com on the sidelines of the Subroto Cup.The words of the former world number one in 50m 3 position rifle come at a time when Indian shooters are riding a wave of success. Manu Bhaker set the tone at the Paris 2024 Olympics with two bronze medals, while Suruchi Singh, Arya Borse, Arjun Babuta, Sift Kaur Samra and Elavenil Valarivan all made their mark at the ISSF World Cup of late. On Tuesday, Bhaker added another bronze at the Asian Shooting Championships in Kazakhstan. On the pitch, however, the first match of the tournament lived up to its billing.

Sainik School had two goals ruled out for offside, but the contest brimmed with spirit, making it a fitting start to a competition that continues to nurture India’s next generation of footballers.With the Subroto Cup bringing in yet another generation of talented footballers, and shooters continuing to collect medals on the international stage, India’s sporting future looks brighter than ever.The junior girls’ competition runs until August 28, with the sub-junior boys and junior boys categories set to follow.

Sanju Samson (X) Former India batter Aakash Chopra believes Shubman Gill’s return to the side has all but ended Sanju Samson’s chances of finding a place in the playing XI for the Asia Cup in the UAE. “India seems to be moving in the direction of an all-format captain. With Shubman Gill’s return, Sanju Samson’s fate has more or less been sealed. He will not feature in the playing XI now. You will not drop Tilak Varma or Hardik Pandya, which means Samson sits out and Jitesh Sharma will likely get the nod again. One thing is very clear from this selection, the batting slots have been prioritised over personalities. With Gill coming in as vice-captain, he will definitely play and open the batting.

SUBSCRIBE NOW! The announcement of Gill as vice-captain has once again placed a question mark over Samson’s future in T20 internationals. Samson has been included in the squad, but Gill’s return has raised doubts about whether the Kerala batter will make the playing XI. The speculation has grown stronger after chief selector Ajit Agarkar read out the names in a particular order. Gill and Jitesh Sharma were mentioned first, while Samson and Rinku Singh were named towards the end. Many see this as an indication that Gill will open alongside Abhishek Sharma, while Jitesh may take the gloves and bat in the finisher’s role. With Tilak Varma, Suryakumar Yadav, Shivam Dube, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel expected to fill the middle-order positions, Samson’s opportunities look limited. Jitesh could also be preferred over Rinku Singh as a late-order pinch-hitter. Agarkar, however, played down the debate, saying the final XI would be decided by the captain and coach once the team reaches Dubai. “The captain-coach will take the call on the best balance for the team. Once we get to Dubai, we will have a bit more clarity. With more options available now, Shubman has been in great form for the last few months. So has Sanju, so two good options, along with Abhishek,” Agarkar said.PollWhich player seems most likely to take the gloves in the Asia Cup?Sanju SamsonJitesh Sharma Skipper Suryakumar Yadav added weight to Jitesh Sharma’s case, praising his transformation as a batter over the past year. “Post the last T20 World Cup, we spoke a lot on how to go about it. We said let’s not think of milestones ahead, follow your journey. He has been a completely different cricketer post that. The way he performed in the IPL and domestic tournaments, he has earned his spot again,” Surya said. The captain also defended the selection of pacer Harshit Rana, highlighting his consistency. “He has played really well in the IPL. In Pune, he came in as a concussion replacement and was Man of the Match in the last game he played for India. We back his skills, we know he can deliver,” Surya added. With both the chief selector and captain offering different signals, Samson faces another nervous wait. For now, his inclusion in the squad is not under question, but his place in the XI looks increasingly uncertain.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

As Mercury's core loses heat, the crust adjusts, forming thrust faults and scarps. New measurements reveal a radius decrease of 2.7 to 5.6 kilometers, offering insights into Mercury's tectonic activity and geological evolution, enhancing our understanding of small rocky planets.  Mercury, the smallest planet in our solar system, has captivated scientists due to its extreme temperatures, dense iron-rich core, magnetic field, and distinctive geological features. Recent research reveals that Mercury is gradually shrinking over time, a process driven by the cooling and contraction of its deep interior layers. As the planet’s core loses heat, the rigid outer crust adjusts, forming thrust faults, ridges, and cliff-like scarps visible across the surface. New measurement techniques using spacecraft data indicate that Mercury’s radius has decreased by 2.7 to 5.6 kilometres, providing the most precise estimate to date. These groundbreaking findings offer crucial insights into Mercury’s tectonic activity, internal dynamics, planetary contraction, and long-term geological evolution, enhancing our broader understanding of how small rocky planets form, stabilize, and change over billions of years.Understanding Mercury’s shrinking radius: How the smallest planet in our solar system continues contractingRecent research shows that Mercury’s radius has decreased by 2.7 to 5.6 kilometres. This is a refinement from earlier estimates of 1 to 7 kilometres, which had wide margins of error.The shrinkage is primarily due to cooling within Mercury’s interior. As the planet loses heat over billions of years, the core contracts slightly. Since the crust sits on top of this cooling, shrinking core, it must also adjust, causing the surface to compress. This adjustment forms thrust faults—areas where the crust is pushed together—and produces steep, cliff-like features known as scarps, some stretching hundreds of kilometres long.Previously, scientists estimated shrinkage indirectly by measuring the size of these surface faults. However, because fault heights and lengths can vary and overlap, the earlier estimates were imprecise. The new research provides a more direct and accurate method of calculating how much Mercury has contracted.New method tracks Mercury’s shrinking radius accuratelyPlanetary geologists Stephan R. Loveless and Christian Klimczak introduced a novel approach to measure Mercury’s shrinkage. Instead of averaging all faults, they focused on the largest, most representative faults from three extensive datasets. These datasets ranged from 100 faults to nearly 6,000 faults, covering the planet’s surface comprehensively.All datasets consistently indicated that 2 to 3.5 kilometres of contraction occurred due to faulting alone. When additional cooling processes of Mercury’s mantle and core are considered, the total contraction reaches 5.6 kilometres. This method reduces uncertainty and provides a clearer, more precise understanding of Mercury’s geological history.Why Mercury shrinks faster than other planetsMercury’s iron-rich core loses heat more quickly than Earth’s, which explains why the planet contracts faster. As the core cools and shrinks, the rigid outer crust is forced to adapt to the smaller volume beneath it. Over billions of years, this process has reduced Mercury’s total diameter by approximately 11 kilometres since its formation.The contrast with Earth is significant. Earth retains more internal heat due to its larger size and tectonic activity, so its contraction is far slower. Mercury, being smaller and lacking active plate tectonics, shows the effects of core cooling much more visibly on its surface.Mercury’s thrust faults and scarps reveal planetary contraction and coolingMercury’s thrust faults and cliff-like scarps are direct evidence of planetary contraction. These formations occur where sections of the crust are pushed together, often producing dramatic features that rise several kilometres above surrounding terrain.By mapping and analyzing these structures, scientists can trace Mercury’s contraction over time. The distribution and orientation of faults also reveal how the interior cooled unevenly, causing localized stress and deformation. These surface features act as a natural record of the planet’s cooling history.Studying Mercury’s contraction offers insights beyond just one planet. The methods used in this research could be applied to other rocky planets like Mars or exoplanets, helping scientists understand their tectonics, cooling rates, and geological evolution.Understanding Mercury also improves models of planetary formation and evolution. By observing how heat loss affects a planet’s structure, researchers can better predict the long-term dynamics of terrestrial worlds, including those that could potentially support life.Also Read | NASA alert!

NASA and ISRO will monitor this event. The asteroid is large, but poses no threat. Such flybys help scientists refine orbital models. They also help in planetary defense strategies. ISRO plans future missions to study near-Earth asteroids. International collaboration is key for planetary defense.  Asteroids have long fascinated scientists and the public alike, serving as reminders of both the beauty and unpredictability of our universe. These rocky remnants from the solar system’s formation often pass through Earth’s neighborhood, sometimes sparking excitement and curiosity when they come unusually close. While most of these flybys are harmless, they provide valuable opportunities for researchers to study asteroid behavior, refine orbital models, and improve planetary defense systems. NASA, along with other global space agencies, closely monitors such events to ensure Earth’s safety and to expand our understanding of near-Earth objects. One such asteroid making headlines now is 1997 QK1, a massive space rock expected to pass Earth on August 20, 2025, during a safe but significant flyby.NASA confirms asteroid 1997 QK1 will pass Earth on August 20: Size and distanceAsteroid 1997 QK1 was first detected in the late 1990s and has been tracked ever since. It belongs to the Aten group of near-Earth asteroids, named after the Egyptian sun god Aten. These asteroids are unique because their orbits cross Earth’s path around the Sun, making them frequent candidates for close encounters. This asteroid’s large size makes it particularly notable. To put its dimensions into perspective:It is longer than three football fields lined up. If it ever struck Earth, it could cause regional devastation, though not global extinction like the asteroid linked to the dinosaurs’ demise.Fortunately, its trajectory ensures it will remain safely distant during this flyby.On August 20, the asteroid will pass within 1.87 million miles (3 million kilometers) of Earth. While this may sound vast, in astronomical terms it qualifies as a close approach. For comparison:The Moon orbits Earth at about 238,855 miles (384,400 km).This asteroid will pass roughly eight times farther than the Moon’s distance.Though distant in human terms, space agencies classify such encounters as significant because they allow researchers to refine orbital predictions and study asteroid behavior more closely.Why Asteroid 1997 QK1 is not a threatAsteroids are classified as Potentially Hazardous Objects (PHOs) if they meet two conditions:They are larger than 140 meters (460 feet).They come within 4.6 million miles (7.4 million km) of Earth.Asteroid 1997 QK1 meets both criteria, but “potentially hazardous” does not mean “imminently dangerous.” Instead, it signals that its path deserves careful tracking and monitoring by astronomers worldwide. NASA’s precise calculations confirm that this flyby is safe, with no risk of impact now or in the near future, and continuous observations ensure early warning of any unexpected trajectory changes.Why NASA and global space agencies track asteroidsAsteroid monitoring is a cornerstone of planetary defense. Even small changes in an asteroid’s orbit—caused by gravitational nudges from planets or effects like the Yarkovsky effect (when sunlight heats one side of an asteroid, slowly altering its trajectory)—can shift its long-term path.By observing asteroids like 1997 QK1, scientists aim to:Improve orbital models to predict future movements.Assess their composition, density, and spin rate.Explore strategies for deflection missions if a dangerous asteroid is discovered in the future.Notably, NASA’s DART mission (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) in 2022 demonstrated the possibility of altering an asteroid’s orbit by deliberately crashing a spacecraft into it—an important milestone in planetary defense.India’s ISRO plans future missions to study near-Earth asteroidsThe interest in asteroids is not limited to NASA. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has outlined plans for participation in global asteroid studies. According to ISRO Chairman S. Somanath, future missions may include research on larger near-Earth objects, especially as the world prepares for the highly anticipated close approach of asteroid Apophis in 2029.International collaborations involving NASA, ESA (European Space Agency), and JAXA (Japan) are essential, as planetary defense requires shared data and joint strategies. By pooling resources and expertise, space agencies ensure Earth is better prepared for cosmic encounters.Why asteroid 1997 QK1’s flyby is a scientific opportunity for NASA and ISROThe flyby of 1997 QK1 is more than a cosmic spectacle—it is a scientific opportunity. Studying such objects helps researchers uncover:Clues about the solar system’s formation, since asteroids are primitive building blocks of planets.Insights into their structural integrity, important for future resource mining or deflection missions.Better risk assessment models, ensuring preparedness for genuine threats.Although harmless, this event underscores the importance of constant vigilance. The universe is filled with millions of space rocks, and only careful monitoring can separate harmless visitors from those that could alter life on Earth.Also Read | NASA intern Thad Roberts stole $21 million in moon rocks from Johnson Space Center for love; shocked the worldAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Beyond survival and adaptation, the crew discovered an unexpected benefit in PS4 gaming. Video games helped maintain cognitive sharpness, reduce stress, and improve problem-solving skills.  In 2023, NASA conducted a groundbreaking experiment to simulate life on Mars, confining four volunteers in a habitat replica for over a year. The mission, known as CHAPEA (Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog), aimed to study how humans cope with extreme isolation, limited resources, and communication delays. While the scientific focus was on survival, adaptation, and psychological resilience, the crew discovered an unexpected ally: PS4 gaming. Beyond entertainment, video games helped the volunteers maintain cognitive sharpness, reduce stress, and improve problem-solving skills, offering insights for the future of long-duration space missions.How NASA simulates life on MarsThe CHAPEA mission recreated the harsh and confined conditions astronauts would face on a Mars journey. Volunteers lived in a 160-square-meter habitat at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston for 378 days. The experiment tested not only physical endurance, like managing food supplies and simulated spacewalks, but also the emotional and mental resilience of a crew cut off from the outside world. With Mars missions expected to last up to two years, understanding isolation’s impact on teamwork, decision-making, and morale is critical for preparing astronauts for interplanetary travel.Video games as a mental health tool During the mission, PS4 gaming became a central way for the crew to cope with monotony and stress. Strategy and simulation games like SimCity, Civilization, and Factorio challenged the participants to plan, manage resources, and solve complex problems, skills directly relevant to space travel. Microbiologist Anca Selariu noted that gaming sessions offered cognitive training while providing a mental escape, keeping the crew’s minds active and morale high. NASA researchers now see gaming as a potential standard tool for future long-duration missions. This experiment suggests that future astronauts could benefit from custom-designed video games tailored for space missions.Coping with isolation and psychological challenges The volunteers experienced strict isolation, with communication to NASA delayed by 22 minutes each way. Living without natural light in a small habitat tested their mental endurance. Video games played a vital role in maintaining mental health, helping reduce feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and stress. They also encouraged teamwork, strategic thinking, and problem-solving under pressure, essential skills for astronauts on real interplanetary missions. The CHAPEA mission demonstrates that structured entertainment can complement physical and psychological training for future explorers.Lessons for future Mars missions NASA’s Mars simulation experiment highlights the importance of addressing psychological needs during long-duration spaceflight. Incorporating video games and other interactive entertainment may improve astronauts’ cognitive function, morale, and overall mission success. By combining rigorous scientific research with practical coping strategies, missions like CHAPEA pave the way for safer, more effective human exploration of Mars and beyond. As NASA looks toward crewed missions to Mars in the 2030s, these findings could play a key role in shaping astronaut preparation.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

The launch represents a significant milestone in commercial space exploration and highlights the growing collaboration between private companies and government space agencies.ESCAPADE mission: Blue Origin and NASA’s groundbreaking Mars explorationBlue Origin, led by Jeff Bezos, will carry NASA’s twin ESCAPADE probes to Mars aboard the New Glenn rocket. The probes are designed to study Mars’ magnetosphere and space weather, analyzing how solar wind interacts with the Martian atmosphere and affects the planet’s climate and radiation environment. Managed by the University of California’s Space Sciences Laboratory, this mission will provide vital data for scientists studying Mars’ unique atmospheric and magnetic characteristics. Beyond its scientific goals, the mission represents a major collaboration between NASA and the commercial space sector, showing how private companies like Blue Origin can contribute to deep-space exploration while supporting critical planetary research initiatives.Blue Origin New Glenn’s role in interplanetary spaceflightThe upcoming launch is a milestone for Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket, which stands 188.5 feet tall and is designed for heavy-lift commercial and interplanetary missions. This mission will be the first time New Glenn is tasked with delivering payloads beyond Earth orbit, demonstrating the rocket’s precision, reliability, and long-range capabilities. Successfully transporting the ESCAPADE probes will solidify New Glenn’s role as a key player in commercial interplanetary travel and will provide valuable insights into the performance of large rockets under the unique stresses of a Mars-bound mission. This step will further position Blue Origin in the competitive landscape of space exploration.Reusable rocket technologyBlue Origin plans to recover New Glenn’s first stage booster, which measures 57.5 meters, using a drone ship stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. The recovery is a crucial step in Blue Origin’s mission to create fully reusable rockets, aiming to lower launch costs and reduce the environmental footprint of space missions. While the first test flight in early 2025 successfully delivered payloads to Earth orbit, the booster landing attempt was unsuccessful. This upcoming flight offers another chance to perfect booster recovery, a key technology for sustainable and cost-effective interplanetary missions. Mastering reusability is central to Blue Origin’s long-term vision for commercial spaceflight.Secondary payload: Advancing space communicationsIn addition to the ESCAPADE probes, New Glenn will carry a secondary payload from satellite communications company Viasat. This demonstration supports NASA’s Communications Services Project, aimed at improving satellite communication networks for both near-Earth and interplanetary operations. The payload will test advanced communication technologies that could enhance data transmission between spacecraft and Earth, supporting future missions to Mars, the Moon, and beyond. By integrating secondary payloads, Blue Origin can provide additional value to NASA and commercial partners, while advancing technologies that are essential for the next generation of space exploration. This mission underscores Blue Origin’s growing role as a frontrunner in humanity’s push toward Mars and deep space.Blue Origin and SpaceX in the Mars raceWhile Blue Origin’s New Glenn will launch NASA’s Mars probes before SpaceX sends any payload to the Red Planet, Elon Musk’s Starship continues to undergo testing and development for future Mars missions. This launch highlights the growing importance of commercial companies in planetary exploration and the role private firms play in advancing space technology. Both Blue Origin and SpaceX are pushing the boundaries of rocket design, reusability, and interplanetary capability, creating a new era of collaboration and competition in the quest to explore Mars and other distant worlds.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

He was greeted by ministers, ISRO chairman, and space enthusiasts. Shukla is scheduled to meet PM Modi and participate in National Space Day celebrations, with Parliament set to discuss his mission and India's space program. Astronaut Subhanshu Shukla, along with astronaut Prashant Balakrishnan Nair, receives grand welcome from Union space minister Jitendra Singh, Delhi CM Rekha Gupta and and Isro chairman V Narayanan at the Delhi airport NEW DELHI: Following his historic mission to the International Space Station (ISS), Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla received a red-carpet welcome at Delhi’s IGI airport as he returned to the country from the US in the early hours of Sunday. Shukla, who piloted the spacecraft to the space station as part of the Axiom-4 mission, was welcomed by Union space minister Jitendra Singh, Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta and Isro chairman V Narayanan, and a large crowd of space enthusiasts at the airport.Posting on X later, minister Jitendra Singh said, “A moment of pride for India! A moment of glory for #ISRO! A moment of gratitude to the dispensation that facilitated this under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. India’s Space glory touches the Indian soil… as the iconic son of Mother India, Gaganyatri Shubhanshu Shukla lands at Delhi in the early hours of morning today. Accompanying him, another equally accomplished Group Captain Prasanth Balakrishnan Nair, one of the astronauts selected for India’s first Human mission Gaganyaan who was India’s designated backup for the mission to the ISS. Privileged to receive both of them”.Shukla is expected to meet PM Modi and then travel to his hometown Lucknow. He is likely to return to the Capital on Aug 22–23 to participate in the National Space Day celebrations.PollShould the Indian government invest more in space exploration?DefinitelyNo, we need to focus on other issuesThe Lok Sabha will hold a special discussion on Monday on India's space journey and Shukla's historic mission aboard the ISS, according to a notice issued by the lower House. The House will discuss “India's first astronaut aboard the ISS — critical role of space programme for Viksit Bharat by 2047”, which could possibly end the deadlock between the govt and opposition in Parliament over the electoral roll revision in Bihar.Earlier on Saturday, Shukla had posted a smiling photograph of himself on a flight and said he was filled with emotions. “As I sit on the plane to come back to India, I have a mix of emotions running through my heart. I feel sad leaving a fantastic group of people behind who were my friends and family for the past one year during this mission. I am also excited about meeting all my friends, family, and everyone in the country for the first time post mission. I guess this is what life is -- everything all at once," he said.In the 79th Independence Day speech at the Red Fort on Friday, PM Modi, while mentioning Group Captain Shukla’s successful mission to ISS, had said that India is working towards becoming self-reliant in the space sector and preparing for the launch of Gaganyaan, its indigenous human space flight mission, and is also working on developing its own space station.In June, Shukla became the second Indian to go to space — after IAF wing commander Rakesh Sharma in 1984— as part of the Axiom-4 mission to the ISS. During the 18-day mission, Shukla, along with astronauts Peggy Whitson (US), Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski (Poland), and Tibor Kapu (Hungary), conducted more than 60 experiments and 20 outreach sessions aboard the ISS. He returned to the Earth on July 16.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous8 best anti-ageing ingredients you should start using in your 20sLifestyle10 best vegetarian sources of IronLifestyleSalwar tales by gorgeous lady Shabana ShajahantvCars under Rs 6 lakh with six airbags: Maruti Alto, Nissan Magnite and moreautoKundali Bhagya fame Shraddha Arya’s stunning ethnic lookstvAnupama Parameswaran shines bright in striking snapsEntertainment'Coolie' actress Reba Monica John’s picture-perfect momentsEntertainmentMalavika Mohanan's stunning style moments you can't missEntertainmentJannat Zubair’s Gen-Z Style is Pure PerfectiontvEver heard of Flying fish?

Orbiting 460 miles above Earth, it will capture high-resolution radar images, penetrating clouds and darkness. This breakthrough will provide critical data on climate change, natural hazards, and agricultural trends, offering global benefits through open data access.  In a landmark achievement for global space cooperation, NASA and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) have successfully deployed the world’s largest radar antenna in orbit. The 33-foot antenna, part of the joint NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission, is designed to capture Earth’s surface in unprecedented detail. Orbiting about 460 miles above the planet, the mission will provide high-resolution radar images that can penetrate clouds and operate both day and night. This breakthrough will empower scientists, policymakers, and disaster-response teams worldwide by offering critical data on climate change, natural hazards, and agricultural trends. The milestone marks a new era in Earth observation, combining advanced engineering with international collaboration.NASA, ISRO, and NISAR: Redefining Earth observationThe NISAR satellite, jointly managed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and ISRO, is equipped with dual-frequency L- and S-band synthetic aperture radar. This system allows it to track Earth’s surface changes with remarkable precision. Unlike optical satellites limited by weather or lighting conditions, NISAR provides continuous, reliable data, making it a game-changer for monitoring glaciers, forests, seismic activity, and farmlands. NASA emphasizes that this technology will revolutionize how nations prepare for disasters and manage resources.The 33-foot antenna, the largest ever used in a NASA Earth science mission, was built by Astro Aerospace, a Northrop Grumman company. Compact at launch, it expanded in orbit into its full umbrella-like shape. Engineers designed it to survive the extreme pressures of launch, the vacuum of space, and constant rotation at 4.5 revolutions per minute. This massive aperture is crucial for generating sharp radar images that will enable groundbreaking scientific studies.Synthetic aperture radar: Seeing the unseenSynthetic aperture radar (SAR) works like a powerful camera lens, simulating a larger antenna to produce high-resolution images. Using interferometric techniques, NISAR can compare radar images over time, creating 3D models of surface changes. These models can reveal subtle shifts such as slow land subsidence, early signs of landslides, or glacier retreat that would otherwise remain invisible. This makes SAR a vital tool for both climate research and urban planning.Global benefits of open dataNISAR’s open data policy ensures that its findings will be freely available to scientists, governments, and humanitarian organizations. From tracking crop cycles to forecasting geological hazards, its data will strengthen global food security and disaster preparedness. With the satellite set to revisit Earth every 12 days, decision-makers will gain access to a steady stream of actionable insights, helping build resilience against climate and environmental challenges. Beyond agriculture and disaster management, the mission will also aid in monitoring polar ice loss, deforestation, wetland health, and urban expansion. By providing this wealth of information, NISAR supports evidence-based policy decisions, empowering nations to respond effectively to environmental risks, mitigate climate change impacts, and create sustainable solutions for future generations.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

This Oligocene-era predator, unlike modern baleen whales, possessed sharp teeth and large eyes, indicating an active hunting lifestyle. The remarkably preserved fossil offers crucial insights into whale evolution, particularly the transition from toothed predators to filter feeders.  In a groundbreaking discovery, scientists from Monash University and Museums Victoria have unearthed a 26-million-year-old whale skull at Jan Juc Beach in Victoria, Australia. The fossil belongs to a newly identified species, Janjucetus dullardi, a small but fierce predator from the Oligocene epoch. According to the research published on Tuesday, August 12, 2025 in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, the whale specimen (Janjucetus dullardi) represents a juvenile or subadult individual, estimated to be about 7 feet (2.1 meters) in length. Unlike modern baleen whales that filter-feed, Janjucetus had sharp teeth and large eyes, indicating it actively hunted prey like fish and squid.The fossil is exceptionally well-preserved, including the skull, ear bones, and teeth, rare features that offer vital insights into whale evolution. This species represents a key stage between land-dwelling ancestors and fully aquatic whales, helping scientists understand how early whales adapted to life in the ocean. The discovery not only sheds light on the evolutionary shift from toothed predators to filter feeders, but also provides a rare glimpse into ancient marine ecosystems. It highlights southern Australia’s importance in understanding the rich history of life in prehistoric oceans.How the whale skull fossil was discoveredScientists have revealed a 26-million-year-old whale skull fossil found in 2019 by fossil enthusiast Ross Dullard at Jan Juc Beach, Victoria, Australia. The fossil, embedded in ancient marine sediments, belongs to a newly identified species named Janjucetus dullardi, a small but fierce predator from the Oligocene epoch. Unlike modern baleen whales that filter-feed, Janjucetus had sharp teeth and large eyes, indicating it actively hunted prey such as fish and squid. Measuring just 2–3 meters in length, it was much smaller than today’s whales but well-adapted for predation in the warm, subtropical seas of its time.The fossil’s exceptional preservation, including parts of the skull, teeth, and ear bones, offers paleontologists an unprecedented look into early whale anatomy. Detailed examination of its jaw structure, sensory organs, and hearing system provides valuable insight into the evolutionary transition from land-dwelling mammals to fully aquatic whales. This discovery significantly advances our understanding of whale evolution and ancient marine ecosystems.What the whale skull fossil reveals about anatomyIn a groundbreaking discovery, scientists have unveiled a 26-million-year-old whale skull fossil, found in 2019 by fossil enthusiast Ross Dullard at Jan Juc Beach in Victoria, Australia. The fossil belongs to a newly identified species, Janjucetus dullardi, a small but powerful predator from the Oligocene epoch. Unlike modern baleen whales, Janjucetus had large forward-facing eyes, indicating sharp vision for hunting, and a jaw lined with sharp teeth suited for catching fish and other marine animals. Measuring 2–3 meters in length, it was much smaller than today’s whales but well-adapted for life as an agile marine hunter. Exceptionally preserved, the fossil includes parts of the skull, teeth, and ear bones. These features reveal early hearing adaptations, helping researchers understand how ancient whales detected prey underwater. By studying this skull, scientists gain rare insight into the evolutionary shift from active predation to filter feeding, and into the behavior, anatomy, and ecology of early whales in prehistoric oceans.Why this whale skull fossil matters for evolutionThe whale skull fossil of Janjucetus dullardi is key to understanding early whale evolution. As part of the mammalodontid lineage, this species illustrates the diversity of feeding strategies in ancient oceans. The fossil shows how whales adapted from land mammals to aquatic predators with specialized hunting features. Examining the whale skull helps researchers trace evolutionary steps toward modern whales, highlighting the shift from active predation to filter feeding. Fossils like this illuminate the ecological pressures that shaped marine life millions of years ago.The broader importance of fossil whale skullsDiscoveries like this fossil whale skull highlight the value of fossils in studying life’s history. Whale skulls are rarely preserved due to oceanic erosion, making this find exceptionally significant. Fossils allow scientists to analyze skull morphology, sensory adaptations, and feeding strategies in detail. By studying ancient whale fossils, researchers can better understand how whales responded to environmental changes over millions of years and trace the evolutionary lineage of today’s marine giants.The 26-million-year-old whale skull fossil of Janjucetus dullardi is a milestone in paleontology. Its well-preserved skull, teeth, and ear bones provide a window into the life of ancient predatory whales and their adaptations. Studying this fossil enhances our understanding of early whales, their hunting behaviors, and their ecological roles. Ongoing research into fossils like this continues to illuminate the complex history of marine life and the evolutionary path that led to the majestic whales we see in our oceans today.Also read| Toothpaste made from hair: A sustainable innovation to repair teeth naturallyAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Researchers successfully translated imagined words into text using brain implants and AI. The study, part of the BrainGate2 trial, demonstrated that brain signals for imagined speech are similar to those for attempted speech.  For decades, neuro-engineers have dreamed of helping people who have been cut off from the world of language. A disease like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, weakens the muscles in the airway. A stroke can kill neurons that normally relay commands for speaking. Perhaps, by implanting electrodes, scientists could record the brain's electric activity and translate that into spoken words.Now a team of researchers has made an important advance toward that goal. Previously they succeeded in decoding the signals produced when people tried to speak. In the new study, published Thursday in the journal Cell, their computer often made correct guesses when the subjects simply imagined saying words.Christian Herff, a neuroscientist at Maastricht University in the Netherlands who was not involved in the research, said the result went beyond the merely technological and shed light on the mystery of language. "It's a fantastic advance," Herff said. The new study is the latest result in a long-running clinical trial, called BrainGate2, that has already seen some remarkable successes.One participant, Casey Harrell, now uses his brain-machine interface to hold conversations. In 2023, after ALS had made his voice unintelligible, Harrell agreed to have electrodes implanted in his brain. A computer recorded the electrical activity from the implants as Harrell attempted to say different words. Over time, with the help of AI, the computer predicted 6,000 words, with 97.5% accuracy.But successes like this raised a troubling question: Could a computer accidentally record more than patients actually wanted to say?Could it eavesdrop on their inner voice? "We wanted to investigate if there was a risk of the system decoding words that weren't meant to be said aloud," said Erin Kunz, a neuroscientist at Stanford University and an author of the study. She and her colleagues also wondered if patients might actually prefer using inner speech.Kunz and her colleagues decided to investigate the mystery for themselves. The scientists gave participants seven different words, including "kite" and "day," then compared the brain signals when participants attempted to say the words and when they only imagined saying them.As it turned out, imagining a word produced a pattern of activity similar to that of trying to say it, but the signal was weaker. The computer did a good job of predicting which of the seven words the participants were thinking. For Harrell, it didn't do much better than a random guess would have, but for another participant it picked the right word more than 70% of the time.The researchers put the computer through more training, this time specifically on inner speech. Its performance improved significantly, including on Harrell. Now when the participants imagined saying entire sentences, such as "I don't know how long you've been here," the computer could accurately decode most of the words.Herff, who has done his own studies, was surprised that the experiment succeeded. Before, he would have said that inner speech is fundamentally different from the motor cortex signals that produce actual speech. "But in this study, they show that, for some people, it isn't that different," he said.Kunz emphasized that the computer's current performance involving inner speech would not be good enough to let people hold conversations. "The results are an initial proof of concept more than anything," she said. But she is optimistic that decoding inner speech could become the new standard for brain-computer interfaces. In recent trials, she and her colleagues have improved the computer's accuracy. "We haven't hit the ceiling yet," she said.

A chance find on an Australian beach has revealed a rare, entirely new species, Janjucetus dullardi, that could unlock new clues about whale evolution.The 25-million-year-old juvenile specimen, small enough to fit in a single bed, was identified in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. It had bulging, tennis-ball-sized eyes, a shark-like snout, and sharp teeth designed for hunting. “It was, let’s say, deceptively cute,” said Erich Fitzgerald, senior curator of vertebrate paleontology at Museums Victoria. “It might have looked like some weird mash-up between a whale, a seal and a Pokémon, but they were very much their own thing.”The partial skull, including ear bones and teeth, was found in 2019 along Victoria’s Jan Juc Beach, a site known for unusual whale fossils. Janjucetus dullardi is only the fourth species ever identified in the mammalodontid group, early whales that lived during the Oligocene Epoch, about 34–23 million years ago. These predators, around three metres long, were an early branch of the lineage that led to modern baleen whales, but looked radically different. “They may have had tiny little nubbins of legs just projecting as stumps,” Fitzgerald said, a mystery that will remain unless a more complete skeleton is found.The species name honours Ross Dullard, the amateur fossil hunter who spotted something black protruding from a cliff during a low-tide search. When he poked it, a tooth fell out. “I thought, geez, we’ve got something special here,” he said. Museums Victoria confirmed this week it was a new species. Dullard, a school principal, said the news was “the greatest 24 hours of my life,” describing rock-star treatment at work with “high fives coming left, right and centre.”This is the first mammalodontid found in Australia since 2006 and only the third in the country. Whale fossils of this quality are rare because most skeletons are lost to erosion, scavengers, and currents over millions of years. “It’s only the chosen few… that actually get preserved as fossils,” Fitzgerald noted.Researchers say Janjucetus dullardi could help reveal how early whales fed, moved, and adapted to ancient warm oceans, insights that could inform how modern marine life responds to climate change. Dullard plans to mark the occasion with a “fossil party” featuring cetacean-themed games and whale-shaped jello, to celebrate his nightmare Muppet find. “I’ve had sleepless nights,” he admitted. “I’ve dreamt about this whale.”About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Researchers used diamond anvil cells and X-ray diffraction to observe mineral behavior under extreme conditions, explaining seismic wave anomalies and linking deep mantle processes to plate tectonics, volcanism, and Earth's magnetic field. Something ‘big’ is moving inside Earth; here’s what scientists just found For decades, scientists have sought to unravel the mysteries hidden deep beneath Earth’s surface. One of the most puzzling regions has been the D" layer, located about 2,700 kilometres (1,700 miles) beneath the surface, at the boundary between the planet’s lower mantle and outer core. This zone has long been known for its unusual seismic properties, which have sparked debates about its composition and behaviour.Now, a groundbreaking study conducted by researchers at ETH Zurich has revealed that solid rock in this deep layer of Earth’s mantle can move like a fluid, while still maintaining its solid state. Led by Professor Motohiko Murakami, the research team has provided experimental evidence explaining how minerals in the D" layer align and deform over geological timescales. The findings, published in Communications Earth & Environment, shed new light on mantle convection, plate tectonics, volcanic activity, and even the generation of Earth’s magnetic field.Earth’s hidden D" layer finally comes into focusThe D" layer sits just above the outer core and plays a key role in the planet’s internal dynamics. It has been a focal point for geoscientists because seismic waves passing through it behave differently than expected, often travelling faster in some regions and slower in others. Understanding the cause of these variations has been a challenge, as conditions in this layer involve extreme pressures and temperatures that are difficult to replicate in laboratory experiments.To study the D" layer, Murakami’s team used diamond anvil cells—devices capable of generating pressures exceeding those found deep within Earth—and X-ray diffraction techniques to examine the atomic structure of minerals under such conditions.The researchers recreated the high-pressure, high-temperature environment of the D" layer and observed how minerals behaved. They used magnesium germanate crystals as an experimental analogue for mantle minerals because they exhibit similar structural properties but are easier to work with in the lab.Role of post-perovskite in mantle dynamicsThe study focused on post-perovskite, a high-pressure phase of the mineral perovskite that forms under the extreme conditions of the D" layer. Post-perovskite has unique structural properties that allow its crystals to align in specific patterns when subjected to geological stress over long periods.This alignment enables solid-state flow, a process in which solid rock deforms and moves like a viscous fluid without melting. Such movement plays a critical role in mantle convection—the slow circulation of rock that drives the movement of tectonic plates at Earth’s surface.Explaining seismic wave anomaliesOne of the major outcomes of the research is the explanation for why seismic waves can accelerate by up to seven percent when passing through certain regions of the D" layer. The alignment of post-perovskite crystals changes the way seismic energy travels through the rock, matching patterns observed in global seismological data.This discovery effectively resolves a long-standing puzzle in geophysics and provides a clear link between deep mantle mineral behaviour and surface-level seismic measurements.Impact on plate tectonics and volcanismThe movement of solid rock in the D" layer has significant implications for plate tectonics. Mantle plumes—columns of hot rock rising from deep within the Earth—can be guided by the alignment of post-perovskite minerals, directing heat and material toward the upper mantle and crust.These processes are responsible for creating volcanic hotspots such as those in Hawaii and Iceland. The study also helps explain how deep mantle processes influence the formation of mountain ranges and the activity along subduction zones where one tectonic plate slides beneath another.Connection to Earth’s magnetic fieldBeyond plate tectonics, the findings have important implications for understanding the geodynamo—the mechanism that generates Earth’s magnetic field. The distribution of heat from the deep mantle to the outer core affects convection within the liquid iron core, which in turn influences magnetic field generation.By showing how the D" layer channels heat through solid-state flow, the study reveals a previously underappreciated link between deep mantle processes and the stability and variations of Earth’s magnetic field over the past 200 million years. This breakthrough opens new pathways for future research into how Earth’s deep interior continues to shape the planet’s surface and long-term habitability.Methodology and experimental insightsMurakami’s team achieved their results by:Using diamond anvil cells to create pressures of hundreds of gigapascals, similar to those at the core-mantle boundary.Applying high-temperature lasers to simulate the intense heat found deep underground.Analysing the crystal structures with synchrotron X-ray diffraction to observe how minerals deform under such conditions.Studying magnesium germanate as a stand-in for mantle perovskite allows the researchers to observe mineral alignment and flow properties.Significance for Earth scienceThe discovery that solid rock can behave like a fluid deep within the Earth provides:A more complete model of mantle convection and its effects on surface geology.An explanation for seismic anomalies detected in the D" layer.New insights into the heat flow between Earth’s core and mantle.A better understanding of how mantle plumes form and influence volcanism.A link between deep Earth processes and magnetic field generation.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

NASA captured 10 mysterious dark voids over remote island near Antarctica: What they reveal about the bizarre natural phenomena
In May 2016, NASA satellites detected ten unusual dark voids within cloud cover above Heard Island, a remote volcanic landmass. These formations, linked to von Kármán vortices, exhibited an atypical darkness, tight spiral structure, and a sharp directional change. This rare event provides scientists with a unique opportunity to study small-island wind effects and their impact on atmospheric patterns.

These formations, linked to von Kármán vortices, exhibited an atypical darkness, tight spiral structure, and a sharp directional change. This rare event provides scientists with a unique opportunity to study small-island wind effects and their impact on atmospheric patterns.  NASA satellites have captured a rare and eerie sight: 10 swirling “dark voids” puncturing thick cloud cover above Heard Island, an isolated volcanic landmass in the southern Indian Ocean, around 900 miles (1,500 km) north of Antarctica. The black patches, each averaging 8 miles (13 km) wide, formed in May 2016 and appear as part of an unusual atmospheric pattern. While these formations are linked to von Karman vortices, swirling air currents formed when wind passes around a tall obstacle, scientists note their unusual darkness, tight spiral structure, and dramatic change in direction make this event exceptional.The 10 dark voids show isolation’s impact on rare weatherThe 10 massive dark voids, captured in May 2016, are a striking example of how Heard Island’s extreme environment fuels rare atmospheric phenomena. This uninhabited Australian territory lies in one of the most remote and storm-battered regions on Earth, within the “Furious Fifties,” where powerful westerly winds dominate. Towering above the island is Mawson Peak, a 9,000-foot (2,700-meter) active volcano that disrupts airflow and cloud formations. The combination of volcanic terrain, fierce winds, and the island’s isolation provides perfect conditions for unusual cloud patterns, but seeing them so distinctly in satellite imagery is extraordinarily rare.Von Karman vortices: Nature’s swirling wind patternsVon Karman vortices form when fast-moving winds encounter an obstacle, such as an island or mountain, disrupting airflow and creating alternating spinning eddies on either side. These patterns are named after physicist Theodore von Karman, who first described the phenomenon. While von Karman vortices are occasionally observed in other regions of the world, such as the Canary Islands or Guadalupe Island, they usually appear as long, wispy trails of clouds. The vortices over Heard Island were instead marked by dense, perfectly circular gaps in the clouds, making this event stand out from typical occurrences.Unusual shape and sharp bend make it uniqueMost von Karman vortex streams appear smooth and aligned, flowing in a consistent direction. In contrast, the May 2016 formation over Heard Island bent sharply by nearly 90 degrees midstream, an abrupt shift likely triggered by intense westerly winds exceeding 50 mph (80 km/h). Additionally, the presence of thick clouds meant that only the vortex cores were visible, creating the illusion of black voids in the sky. This combination of strong winds, sudden directional change, and isolated visibility of the vortex centers is rarely seen in satellite imagery. Such extraordinary formations provide scientists with valuable insights into extreme weather behavior in isolated regions.A rare chance to study small-island wind effectsBecause Mawson Peak is smaller than most peaks that generate von Karman vortices, such patterns in this location are uncommon. This event offered researchers a rare opportunity to analyze how atmospheric flows interact with smaller volcanic landmasses. Studying these effects can improve understanding of how wind patterns influence global weather systems, climate, and even the transport of airborne particles across oceans. The Heard Island vortices also highlight how relatively minor topographic features can cause significant disturbances in large-scale airflow under the right conditions.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

This follows closely after an Indian astronaut's visit to the International Space Station. (Photo: X) NEW DELHI: In a landmark achievement, India has successfully sent its aquanauts to depths of over 5,000 metres in the North Atlantic Ocean.The mission marked a major step towards the country’s Deep Ocean Mission, also known as Samudrayaan. The feat comes just weeks after Shubhanshu Shukla became the first Indian to reach the International Space Station.Historic Moment: Shubhanshu Shukla Touches Down Earth With Spashdown Off U.S. Coast | Axiom-4The expedition was carried out in collaboration with France and involved two Indian aquanauts who completed separate deep dives in the French submersible Nautile earlier this month.PollWhich achievement do you think is more significant for India's scientific progress?Diving over 5,000 metres in the oceanReaching the International Space StationOn 5 August, Raju Ramesh, a scientist at the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), descended 4,025 metres. A record-setting 5,002-metre dive by retired Navy Commander Jatinder Pal Singh the next day followed this.Union Earth Sciences Minister Jitendra Singh said, "We have an Indian going into space and an Indian going into the deep ocean almost simultaneously." He called it part of India’s “double conquest” in underexplored frontiers, which he believes will contribute to the country’s economic growth.The minister added that PM Narendra Modi has shown a strong interest in the Deep Ocean Mission and blue economy.The Deep Ocean Mission, cleared by the Union Cabinet in 2021, covers crewed and uncrewed submersibles, deep-sea mining technology, biodiversity research and ocean-based energy projects. It aims to explore and utilise resources within India’s Exclusive Economic Zone and continental shelf.Matsya 6000M Ravichandran, Secretary in the ministry of Earth sciences, said the Deep Ocean Mission was carried out to gain firsthand experience before India tries the same with its own submersible, Matsya 6000. "One of the verticals of the DOM aims to develop technology to harness non-living ocean resources and a submersible which can carry humans to the deepest parts of the ocean for exploration," he said.The Matsya 6000, likely to be ready by December 2027, will carry three people to depths of 6,000 metres inside a titanium alloy sphere. It will have scientific instruments, communication systems and safety features with emergency endurance of up to 96 hours.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Source: X NASA astronaut Don Pettit has shared a striking near-infrared image of the Ganga River delta on X (formerly Twitter), captured during his Expedition 73 mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Posted on social media, the image provides a rare, high-contrast perspective of the world’s largest river delta, showcasing the vast, fertile landscapes across eastern India and Bangladesh. The photograph highlights the power of space-based observation in understanding Earth’s geography and the delicate ecosystems that sustain millions of people in the region.NASA astronaut captures Ganga river delta: Near-infrared photography reveals hidden ecosystem featuresPettit captured the delta using near-infrared photography, a technique that highlights features invisible to the human eye. Healthy vegetation appears luminous, while rivers, marshes, and agricultural land stand out with remarkable clarity. Scientists use these images to monitor plant health, water distribution, and environmental changes over time. By revealing fine details of the landscape, near-infrared photography allows researchers to track the effects of climate change, urbanisation, and deforestation, providing crucial data to protect this vital ecosystem.Accompanying the image, Pettit described the region as “the largest river delta on Earth,” underscoring both its geographical significance and natural splendour. The photograph quickly drew admiration from scientists, nature lovers, and photography enthusiasts alike and was praised for blending technical precision with artistic expression.Beyond its scientific value, Pettit’s photograph has captured attention for its visual appeal. The glowing greenery, winding rivers, and patchwork of farmland create a composition that blends art and science seamlessly. Social media users and science communities alike have praised the image, noting both its technical precision and aesthetic beauty. Pettit’s work highlights how space photography can inspire curiosity and appreciation for Earth’s landscapes, offering a perspective rarely seen from the ground.The Ganga-Brahmaputra delta: Asia’s largest river delta and vital biodiversity hotspotThe Ganga or Ganges delta, also called the Bengal Delta or Sundarbans Delta, covers more than 100,000 square kilometres and flows into the Bay of Bengal. It is home to millions who depend on its rich soils for agriculture, and it contains the UNESCO-listed Sundarbans mangrove forest. This unique ecosystem provides a habitat for endangered species like the Bengal tiger and supports biodiversity through its dense forests and interwoven waterways. Seasonal flooding replenishes nutrients in the soil, creating highly productive farmland, but also poses challenges for communities living in the delta.The Ganga river delta: Vital ecosystem and environmental stabilityThe Ganga river delta is not only vital for human livelihoods but also plays a crucial role in environmental stability. Its wetlands act as natural buffers against floods, while mangroves prevent coastal erosion and storm damage. These tools also assist in assessing biodiversity, identifying areas of habitat loss, and planning sustainable conservation efforts to protect both wildlife and local communities. Satellite and aerial imagery help scientists monitor these ecosystems, track seasonal flooding, and study the impact of climate change. Pettit’s near-infrared photograph contributes to this research by providing a detailed view of vegetation and land use, complementing other scientific tools used to safeguard the delta’s delicate balance.NASA astronaut Don Pettit’s near-infrared images of the Ganga river delta provide a striking perspective on one of the world’s most vital and expansive ecosystems. Covering over 100,000 square kilometres, the delta sustains millions of people, supports rich biodiversity, and safeguards coastal regions from natural disasters. Pettit’s work combines scientific observation with artistic vision, emphasising the importance of monitoring waterways, vegetation, and ecological health from space. Such imagery not only showcases the beauty and fragility of our planet but also inspires greater environmental awareness, highlighting the urgent need for conservation and fostering a deeper global appreciation of Earth’s natural landscapes.Also Read: NASA and Google collaborating together to develop AI medical assistant to boost astronaut health on Moon and Mars missionsAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

He was aided by Tiffany Fowler and Shae Saur. The stolen rocks were valued at $21 million. Roberts claimed it was for love, but the FBI found he planned to sell them. Roberts and his accomplices were arrested. The heist damaged scientific research. Source: LADbible In one of the most audacious and bizarre crimes in NASA history, Thad Roberts, a 24-year-old intern, stole moon rocks valued at $21 million in 2002, driven by romance rather than greed. Alongside his girlfriend Tiffany Fowler and fellow intern Shae Saur, Roberts executed a meticulously planned burglary at Houston’s Johnson Space Center, using authentic NASA badges, rewired security cameras, and Neoprene suits to bypass alarms. Their theft of 17 pounds of lunar samples included historic moon rocks from Apollo missions 1969–1972. While Roberts claimed the act was “for love,” the FBI revealed he had attempted to sell the rocks secretly online. This extraordinary heist destroyed priceless scientific research, embarrassed NASA, and shocked the world, blending science, crime, and obsession in an unforgettable story.$21 million moon rock theft at Johnson Space Center shocks scientists worldwideOn a July night in 2002, Roberts, Fowler, and Saur infiltrated Building 31 at Johnson Space Center. Roberts and Fowler donned Neoprene bodysuits, which allowed them to bypass thermal alarms, while Saur acted as a lookout. Using a power saw, they cracked open a 601-pound safe containing moon rocks and meteorites, including samples from every Apollo mission, many of which were irreplaceable and scientifically invaluable. The stolen lunar samples were worth approximately $21 million and represented decades of scientific research, experimentation, and NASA missions. The planning and execution demonstrated not only audacity but also technical sophistication, showing how a combination of insider knowledge, meticulous preparation, and determination can circumvent the most secure facilities. Source: Live ScienceWho is Thad Roberts? From NASA Intern to mastermind behind the $21 million moon rock theftThad Roberts graduated from the University of Utah with a triple degree in physics, geology, and geophysics, making him highly qualified to work at NASA. He met Tiffany Fowler, a 22-year-old stem cell researcher, and the couple quickly became romantically involved. Roberts reportedly told Fowler he wanted to “give her the moon,” framing the theft as a grand romantic gesture. According to People.com , the FBI considered financial motives, Roberts maintained that the act symbolized devotion rather than profit.Moon rock theft ends with FBI arrests and millions in NASA lunar samples lostRoberts and Fowler’s motivation went beyond romance—they symbolically “had sex on the moon” by placing stolen lunar samples under a blanket during intimate moments. Roberts later stated, “No one had ever had sex on the moon before,” underscoring the bizarre, almost surreal nature of the crime. While Roberts claimed love was the driving factor, the FBI discovered he had negotiated with a Belgian buyer willing to pay up to $5,000 per gram, proving the theft had financial implications.The heist came to a dramatic end when Roberts and Fowler traveled to Orlando to meet the potential buyer, only to be apprehended by undercover FBI agents. Saur and Gordon McWhorter, who helped arrange the sale, were arrested shortly afterward. The investigation revealed that the theft had caused irreversible damage: the moon rocks were now “virtually useless to the scientific community,” and three decades of NASA research notes were destroyed as reported.Moon rock theft from NASA leads to jail, house arrest, and finesThad Roberts pleaded guilty to the theft of moon rocks and other NASA artifacts, serving over six years of an eight-year prison sentence before his release in 2008. Tiffany Fowler and Shae Saur received house arrest, community service, and were required to pay restitution to NASA. Gordon McWhorter was convicted at trial for his involvement in the theft and sentenced to six years in prison. The case highlighted serious security breaches and led to stricter controls on NASA’s valuable collections.Also Read | NASA and Google collaborating together to boost astronaut health on Moon and Mars missionsAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Bermuda Triangle ‘mystery’ solved? Scientist explains the real cause behind vanishings of ships and planes
The Bermuda Triangle's infamous reputation for unexplained disappearances is largely unfounded, according to scientist Karl Kruszelnicki and supported by NOAA and Lloyd's of London. The region's high traffic volume, combined with challenging environmental conditions like the Gulf Stream and frequent storms, accounts for the incidents. Human error and equipment failure also play significant roles, debunking myths of supernatural forces.

Scientist explains the real cause behind vanishings of ships and planesTOI Science Desk / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Updated: Aug 14, 2025, 10:01 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLargeThe Bermuda Triangle's infamous reputation for unexplained disappearances is largely unfounded, according to scientist Karl Kruszelnicki and supported by NOAA and Lloyd's of London. The region's high traffic volume, combined with challenging environmental conditions like the Gulf Stream and frequent storms, accounts for the incidents. Human error and equipment failure also play significant roles, debunking myths of supernatural forces. Image: Getty Images  For decades, the Bermuda Triangle, the stretch of ocean roughly bounded by Miami, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico, has been the subject of mystery, fear, and speculation. From tales of ships vanishing without a trace to aircraft disappearing mid-flight, the region has inspired theories about supernatural forces, alien abductions, and even time warps. But according to Australian scientist Karl Kruszelnicki, backed by research from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Lloyd’s of London, these myths do not hold up. Far from being a cursed zone, the Bermuda Triangle’s so-called mysteries can be explained by natural environmental conditions, human error, and statistical probability. The truth, Kruszelnicki emphasizes, is far less otherworldly and far more rooted in the realities of nature and navigation.Bermuda Triangle poses no greater risk than other oceansKruszelnicki, supported by NOAA and Lloyd’s of London, has long maintained that the Bermuda Triangle is no more dangerous than any other ocean region. Disappearances occur at roughly the same proportional rate as elsewhere in the world’s waters. As noted by Kruszelnicki, the higher number of incidents is largely due to the Triangle being one of the busiest shipping and flight corridors in the world, where heavy traffic naturally means more recorded accidents. Statistical data confirms that when the volume of vessels and aircraft is taken into account, the accident rate is completely ordinary. This directly challenges the very foundation of the Triangle’s mythical reputation.Environmental and navigational challenges of 'Bermuda Triangle'According to Kruszelnicki, the geography and weather patterns of the Bermuda Triangle create conditions that can challenge even experienced navigators. The Gulf Stream, a powerful ocean current, can cause sudden changes in weather, generate violent storms, and push vessels off course within minutes. The region is also prone to tropical storms, hurricanes, waterspouts, and rogue waves that can overwhelm ships and planes without warning. Numerous islands and coral reefs make for hazardous, shallow navigation routes, increasing the risk of grounding or collision. Kruszelnicki also points out that certain areas experience magnetic anomalies where compasses may point to true north instead of magnetic north, leading to potential navigation errors. Furthermore, unpredictable microbursts and rapidly forming squalls can make navigation extremely hazardous, even for experienced crews. Sudden changes in visibility and wind patterns have historically contributed to numerous near-miss incidents in the area. When all these factors combine, even a minor miscalculation can turn deadly.Human error and equipment failureAs Kruszelnicki explains, a significant number of accidents in the Bermuda Triangle can be traced to pilot or captain mistakes, faulty equipment, or outdated forecasting methods. These human and technical shortcomings often occur alongside the already challenging weather and navigational conditions of the region. In earlier decades, limited communication systems and slower emergency response times meant that vessels or aircraft in trouble had little chance of rescue. Even today, with advanced technology, mistakes and malfunctions can quickly escalate into disasters when compounded by sudden storms or rough seas. Kruszelnicki stresses that the human factor is often underestimated in popular explanations of the Triangle’s incidents.Origins of the myth of the Bermuda Triangle The term “Bermuda Triangle” was first coined in 1963 by writer Vincent Gaddis, who linked the region to a series of unexplained disappearances. His writings sparked public curiosity, but the myth gained massive momentum in 1974 when author Charles Berlitz published a bestselling book that embellished these stories with speculation about Atlantis, alien abductions, and other sensational claims. Kruszelnicki has often criticized such accounts for their lack of credible evidence and reliance on anecdotal storytelling. The entertainment value of the myth overshadowed scientific explanations, cementing its place in pop culture for generations despite the absence of verifiable proof.Famous anecdote – the Bruce Gernon storyIn 1970, pilot Bruce Gernon reported encountering a strange tunnel-like cloud while flying through the Bermuda Triangle. He claimed his instruments malfunctioned, and upon exiting the cloud, he experienced a time discrepancy of about 30 minutes. The story has been widely discussed in books, documentaries, and paranormal circles, with some suggesting it could be evidence of a time warp. Kruszelnicki, however, remains skeptical, noting that the account is anecdotal and lacks corroborating evidence. Many experts, including Kruszelnicki, believe it could be explained by meteorological phenomena such as unusual cloud formations or optical illusions.Scientific consensus over Bermuda TriangleThe conclusion from NOAA, the US Navy, and Lloyd’s of London — all echoed by Kruszelnicki — is clear: the Bermuda Triangle is not more hazardous than any other heavily traveled ocean region. The so-called mystery is a product of natural hazards, geographic challenges, human mistakes, and decades of exaggerated storytelling. Statistically, the accident rates are consistent with those in other busy maritime and aviation areas. While the legend of the Bermuda Triangle may continue to inspire curiosity and creativity, the evidence, as Kruszelnicki emphasizes, points to a reality grounded in science, not the supernatural. Ultimately, the Bermuda Triangle’s greatest power lies not in sinking ships, but in captivating imaginations. It is a reminder that mystery often thrives where facts are overlooked, and that reality can be just as fascinating as myth.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

This ancient water, isolated for millennia, provides unprecedented insights into Earth's early conditions and potential for life in extreme environments. Professor Barbara Sherwood Lollar's team's findings challenge existing assumptions and open new avenues for astrobiological research.  In 2016, scientists discovered the oldest water on Earth deep within a Canadian mine, estimated to be over 2 billion years old. This rare water had been trapped underground, isolated from surface influences, offering unique insights into Earth’s ancient geological past and extreme environments. Professor Barbara Sherwood Lollar and her team made this remarkable discovery in the Kidd Creek Mine in Ontario, Canada. The water's extraordinary age and composition have important implications for understanding subterranean ecosystems and the possibility of life in harsh conditions, including on other planets.This finding marks a groundbreaking moment in geology and astrobiology, revealing how Earth’s deepest waters can hold secrets from billions of years ago.Discovery of the oldest water on Earth in Kidd Creek MineThe oldest water on Earth was uncovered at a depth of about 3 kilometers in the Kidd Creek Mine, Ontario. This water had remained sealed away for roughly 1.5 to 2.6 billion years, surpassing previous finds of ancient water worldwide. The research team, led by geologist Barbara Sherwood Lollar, tested the water’s age using isotopic analysis, confirming its unprecedented age. The longevity and isolation of this water make it a living snapshot of early Earth conditions, preserved untouched for billions of years.This groundbreaking discovery and detailed scientific analysis were published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications in 2014, offering a comprehensive look at the water’s age, chemistry, and significance. The findings challenge previous assumptions about Earth’s hydrological cycles and open new questions about the movement and preservation of water in the planet’s deep crust.Scientific importance of the oldest water on earth discoveryFinding the oldest water on Earth has major scientific significance. It offers clues about how microbial life could survive in isolated environments for billions of years, far from sunlight. This challenges previous assumptions about life’s limits on Earth and extends hope for discovering life in similar extraterrestrial environments, such as Mars or icy moons like Europa. The high salinity and unique chemical composition of this ancient water also provide insight into geological processes that occurred billions of years ago. These findings expand our understanding of Earth’s deep biosphere and the resilience of life. Moreover, studying such ancient water helps scientists understand how life might adapt to extreme conditions, pushing the boundaries of astrobiology and earth sciences.Tasting the oldest water on earth: A geologist’s unique experienceIn a remarkable gesture, Professor Sherwood Lollar tasted the oldest water on Earth herself.

Woman astronomer paid 30 cents an hour: unlocked cosmic distances; still missed out on Nobel Prize
Henrietta Swan Leavitt worked as a Harvard “computer” earning just 30 cents an hour, yet her groundbreaking discovery of the period-luminosity relationship transformed astronomy. Her work enabled scientists to measure cosmic distances and understand the expanding universe. Despite this monumental contribution, Leavitt never received a Nobel Prize during her lifetime, highlighting the challenges faced by women in science.

Her work enabled scientists to measure cosmic distances and understand the expanding universe. Despite this monumental contribution, Leavitt never received a Nobel Prize during her lifetime, highlighting the challenges faced by women in science.  Henrietta Swan Leavitt, an American astronomer whose groundbreaking discovery revolutionized how we measure the cosmos. Born in 1868, Leavitt began working at the Harvard College Observatory at a time when women were excluded from operating telescopes and instead employed as “computers” to analyze astronomical data. Despite earning just 30 cents an hour, her dedication and meticulous research led to one of the most important astronomical breakthroughs of the 20th century.In 1908, Leavitt discovered the period-luminosity relationship of Cepheid variable stars, showing a direct link between their brightness and pulsation period. This discovery became the key to measuring vast cosmic distances and ultimately helped astronomers like Edwin Hubble prove that the universe is expanding. Yet, despite her monumental contributions, Leavitt was never awarded a Nobel Prize during her lifetime.The discovery that changed astronomy foreverLeavitt’s key insight came from studying Cepheid variable stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, a galaxy assumed to be at a uniform distance from Earth. By carefully analyzing photographic plates, she found that the brightness of these stars varied in a predictable way tied to their pulsation period: the longer the period, the brighter the star. This relationship, now known as Leavitt’s Law, gave astronomers a powerful “standard candle,” an object of known brightness that can be used to calculate distances in space.Using this standard candle method, astronomers could measure how far away these stars and by extension, the galaxies they reside in actually were. This was a breakthrough in cosmic distance measurement, allowing scientists to determine the scale of the universe with unprecedented accuracy. Leavitt’s discovery became the foundation for Edwin Hubble’s later work in the 1920s where he used Cepheid variables to prove that the Milky Way was just one of many galaxies and that the universe itself was expanding.Overcoming barriers as a woman in scienceHenrietta Swan Leavitt’s career unfolded during a time when women faced serious discrimination in science. Women were largely relegated to supportive roles and denied opportunities such as telescope operation and academic recognition. Leavitt was paid a modest wage of about 30 cents an hour as a “computer” at Harvard, tasked with analyzing star data rather than conducting independent research.Despite these limitations, she showed extraordinary focus and persistence. Leavitt’s progressive hearing loss later in life made her work even more challenging, yet she continued her observations and calculations until her untimely death at the age of 53. Tragically, although her work was foundational for modern astronomy, she never received the Nobel Prize or equivalent accolades during her lifetime, and a posthumous nomination was not permitted.Legacy and lasting impact on cosmologyLeavitt’s period-luminosity relationship remains one of the cornerstones of astrophysics. It revolutionized the way distances to faraway celestial objects are measured, enabling astronomers to map the universe on a grand scale. This method underpins modern cosmology, helping scientists determine not only distances but also the rate at which the universe is expanding, key to the Big Bang theory.Edwin Hubble famously used Leavitt’s discovery to measure the distances to galaxies beyond the Milky Way and uncover the expanding nature of the universe, a milestone that forever changed humanity’s understanding of our place in the cosmos. Today, Henrietta Swan Leavitt is celebrated as a pioneering figure in astronomy whose brilliance and perseverance overcame societal and physical obstacles, leaving a profound legacy that continues to guide scientific exploration.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

These magnetic nanobots address tooth sensitivity. CalBots seal dentinal tubules using a bioceramic formula. Tests on extracted teeth show promising results. Animal trials demonstrate complete behavioral recovery. The team sees this as a step towards advanced nanorobotics. This innovation offers lasting relief for millions. The CalBots are made from safe materials.  BENGALURU: For millions of people, the sudden, sharp pain of tooth sensitivity can turn a sip of cold water into a jolt. Now, researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), in collaboration with Bengaluru-based deep-tech startup Theranautilus, have engineered “CalBots” – magnetic nanobots that can seal the problem at its source.As per IISc, CalBots are 400-nanometre particles loaded with a calcium silicate-based bioceramic formula, designed to travel deep inside dentinal tubules, the tiny tunnels in the tooth that lead to nerve endings. Guided by an external magnetic field, the bots can penetrate up to 500 micrometres into the tubules and self-assemble into stable, cement-like plugs that recreate the tooth’s natural barrier. One application, the team says, can offer lasting relief.Dental hypersensitivity affects nearly one in four people worldwide and occurs when enamel erosion or gum recession exposes the dentine layer beneath, IISc said. The tubules in dentine act as direct pathways to the nerves, which is why even mild temperature changes can trigger pain. “We didn’t want to create a slightly better version of what’s already out there. We wanted a technology that solves a real problem in a way that no one’s attempted before,” Shanmukh Peddi, postdoctoral researcher at IISc’s Centre for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE) and co-founder of Theranautilus. The team used a completely new class of bioceramic cement for the nanobots. While bioceramics are common in orthopaedics and dentistry, the formulation was designed specifically for hypersensitivity – to travel deeper and last longer.To test the approach, they worked first on extracted human teeth. “On these samples, we applied CalBots under a magnetic field for 20 minutes, during which the bots sealed the dentinal tubules by forming deep, stable plugs – a result confirmed through high-resolution imaging,” Peddi said.They then moved to animal trials, inducing sensitivity in mice and tracking their drinking behaviour. “Healthy mice drank both cold and room temperature water equally. But sensitive mice completely avoided cold water. After treatment, they started drinking it again. We saw 100% behavioural recovery. That was a big moment for us,” he said.The CalBots are made entirely from materials classified as ‘Generally Recognised as Safe’ and passed toxicity tests in mice. “This is a compelling demonstration of what nanorobotics can achieve, and how they could significantly impact future healthcare,” said Ambarish Ghosh, professor at CeNSE and one of the study’s corresponding authors.Debayan Dasgupta, former PhD student at CeNSE and co-founder of Theranautilus, sees this as part of a bigger technological shift. “We’ve created a regenerative, active nanomaterial – a step towards the kind of ‘tiny mechanical surgeons’ Richard Feynman once envisioned,” he said.Peddi added: “This is something we’ve worked towards silently for years. And the fact that we’ve done it here, in India, makes us very happy.”About the AuthorChethan KumarChethan Kumar is a Senior Assistant Editor with the Times of India.

Though smaller than initially thought, it remains the largest interstellar visitor known. Confirmed as a comet with a glowing tail, 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be twice as old as our solar system, offering a glimpse into the early universe.  NASA has revealed exciting new information about a mysterious interstellar object called 3I/ATLAS, speeding through our solar system at extraordinary velocities. First detected on July 1, this visitor from beyond our star system has fascinated scientists globally with its astonishing speed of 130,000 miles per hour and intriguing characteristics. Recent observations from the Hubble Space Telescope have captured the clearest images to date, offering key insights into its size, makeup, and path. These discoveries represent a significant advancement in our understanding of these rare travelers crossing the galaxy into our cosmic neighborhood, deepening knowledge about interstellar dynamics, cosmic evolution, and planetary defense strategies.NASA confirms 3I/ATLAS as the fastest interstellar object ever detectedNASA’s Hubble Space Telescope observations have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is travelling through our solar system at an extraordinary speed of 130,000 miles per hour (209,000 km/h), making it the fastest interstellar object ever recorded. This speed far exceeds that of previous interstellar visitors such as ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. Scientists explain that the object’s velocity is the result of billions of years of gravitational interactions, known as the “gravitational slingshot effect,” where passing stars, planets, and nebulae impart additional momentum to the comet. This extreme speed means the object is only briefly visible as it races through, providing a fleeting window of opportunity for study. NASA’s continuous monitoring aims to capture as much data as possible during its swift passage.Image: Daily MailSize estimates refined: NASA reveals 3I/ATLAS is smaller but still immenseInitial observations by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory suggested that 3I/ATLAS’s icy core might be around seven miles (11.2 km) wide. However, NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has now refined these estimates, revealing that the core is smaller — at most 3.5 miles (5.6 km) across, and possibly as little as 1,000 feet (320 meters) in diameter. Despite being smaller than first believed, this still makes 3I/ATLAS the largest interstellar object ever discovered, dwarfing the next largest known visitor by up to 14 times. The high-resolution images also highlight the comet’s glowing gas halo, which had made it appear larger in earlier, less detailed observations. Understanding the true size helps scientists model its composition, structural integrity, and behavior more accurately as it interacts with powerful solar radiation and cosmic forces.NASA confirms 3I/ATLAS’s cometary nature and its spectacular glowing tailThanks to NASA’s powerful telescopes, scientists have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is not a solid rock but a comet — a chunk of ice, frozen gases, and dust surrounded by a halo of evaporating material. The Hubble images reveal a dust plume streaming from the side of the comet heated by the Sun, along with a faint tail trailing behind it. This tail is formed as the comet’s surface warms up, causing ice to vaporize and release gas and dust into space, creating the characteristic glowing appearance. This phenomenon is similar to that seen in comets within our solar system, but 3I/ATLAS’s interstellar origin and extreme speed make it a rare and valuable subject for study. NASA expects the tail and dust plume to become more pronounced as the object approaches its closest point to the Sun. Scientists hope continued observation will shed light on the comet’s chemical composition, helping reveal clues about its interstellar origins. 3I/ATLAS offers humanity a fleeting glimpse into the mysteries of other star systems, carrying secrets older than our Sun itself.Ancient traveler: NASA estimates 3I/ATLAS is twice as old as our solar systemOne of the most astonishing revelations from NASA’s studies is the estimated age of 3I/ATLAS. Scientific analysis suggests this object has been orbiting the Milky Way for at least eight billion years — roughly twice the age of our own 4.6 billion-year-old solar system. This implies 3I/ATLAS formed long before our Sun and planets came into existence, making it a true cosmic relic. Its journey through the galaxy has likely included multiple gravitational encounters with stars and interstellar clouds, which may have shaped its trajectory and speed. Studying such an ancient object offers scientists a unique glimpse into the conditions and materials present in the early universe and helps refine models of galactic evolution. Its fleeting passage is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to study a messenger from the galaxy’s distant past. NASA researchers emphasize that each discovery from 3I/ATLAS brings us closer to understanding how planetary systems form and evolve across the galaxy.Safe passage confirmed by NASA: No threat to EarthDespite its immense speed and close approach to the Sun, NASA has assured the public that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth. The comet will reach its closest point to the Sun in late October, passing just inside the orbit of Mars at about 130 million miles (210 million kilometers). Crucially, it will be on the opposite side of the Sun relative to Earth during this time, ensuring no risk of collision or gravitational disturbance. NASA continues to monitor the comet’s trajectory precisely, as the interaction with the Sun’s heat may slightly alter its path. After passing the Sun, 3I/ATLAS will head back out into interstellar space, continuing its long journey through the galaxy. This may be humanity’s only chance to witness this ancient traveler before it disappears forever into the cosmic void. Its fleeting visit serves as a reminder of the vast, mysterious, and ever-changing nature of our universe.A new era of discovery: NASA leads the charge in interstellar object research3I/ATLAS marks only the third confirmed interstellar object ever detected, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. NASA’s advancements in telescope technology, sky surveys, and space observatories like Hubble have ushered in a new era of interstellar discovery. Researchers expect that as survey instruments become more sensitive and comprehensive, the frequency of detecting such visitors will increase. NASA plans to utilize not only Hubble but also the James Webb Space Telescope, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory to study 3I/ATLAS in multiple wavelengths. This will allow scientists to capture unprecedented data on the object's composition and interaction with the solar environment. These coordinated observations are crucial for building a more complete picture of interstellar objects and their origins. This coordinated effort will deepen our understanding of the composition, origin, and behavior of interstellar objects and their role in the cosmic ecosystem.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Watch: Floods batter Pakistan; homes swamped, roads submerged
Devastating flash floods in Pakistan have claimed at least 657 lives, including many children, with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province being the hardest hit. Entire villages have been wiped out, mass burials are underway, and hundreds remain missing as rescue efforts continue amidst warnings of more torrential rains. The scale of destruction is immense, with eyewitnesses recounting homes and vehicles swept away.

Entire villages have been wiped out, mass burials are underway, and hundreds remain missing as rescue efforts continue amidst warnings of more torrential rains. The scale of destruction is immense, with eyewitnesses recounting homes and vehicles swept away.  NEW DELHI: Entire villages have been wiped out and mass burials are taking place as flash floods wreak havoc across Pakistan, leaving at least 340 people dead and hundreds missing, news agency AFP reported. Officials and eyewitnesses described scenes of large-scale devastation, with homes, shops and vehicles swept away in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, the hardest-hit region.Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Prime Minister’s coordinator for KP affairs, Ikhtiar Wali Khan, warned the real toll could be far higher. “Entire villages have been wiped out. In Buner's Chagharzi area, massive destruction has taken place, while the village of Bashoni has completely disappeared from the map,” he told ARY News. Expressing fear that deaths in Dir alone could exceed 1,000, he added, “Mass burials are taking place. I have returned from Buner with a heavy heart after witnessing this disaster with my own eyes.”According to Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), torrential monsoon rains, flash floods, and landslides since June 26 have killed at least 657 people, including 171 children and 94 women, and injured 929. KP province alone has reported 390 deaths.PollShould international aid be prioritized for the flood victims in Pakistan?Yes, immediate aid is essentialNo, local resources should be utilized firstRescue workers continue to search for survivors, but officials admit hopes are fading. In Buner district, more than 150 people remain missing, with “10 to 12 entire villages” partially buried, according to local authorities. “The chances of those buried under the debris surviving are very slim,” said Bilal Ahmad Faizi of KP’s rescue agency.Eyewitnesses recalled the horror as floodwaters swept away everything in their path. “We saw all the houses, buildings, and vehicles being swept away like pieces of wood. When we looked down from the mountain, our home was gone,” said Suleman Khan, a schoolteacher who lost 25 relatives in Buner.Officials say the devastation is on par with past climate disasters in Pakistan. The government has declared several mountainous districts disaster-hit, while warnings of more torrential rains in the coming days raise fears of further destruction.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The deluge washed away roads, damaged homes, and disrupted train services on the Jammu-Pathankot line. Rescue operations are underway, with the Army, NDRF, and SDRF assisting victims.  NEW DELHI: A cloudburst in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kathua district has left at least seven people dead and several others injured, triggering landslides, flash floods and large-scale disruption. The incident, which occurred late Saturday night in Jodh Ghati village, washed away roads, damaged homes, and forced authorities into urgent rescue and relief operations.Train services along the vital Jammu-Pathankot line have also been suspended as rising water levels crossed danger marks on a key railway bridge. Helicopter evacuations have been launched, while multiple agencies including the Army, NDRF, SDRF and police are on the ground to restore connectivity and assist victims.Here are the top developments:Death toll rises to seven in KathuaOfficials confirmed that seven people have died in two separate incidents of cloudburst and landslide in Kathua. Five casualties occurred in Jodh Ghati following flash floods triggered by the overnight downpour, while two more died after a landslide in Janglote.Jammu Divisional Commissioner Ramesh Kumar said, “There was heavy rain in Kathua since last night... Seven people have died due to the landslide. Rescue operations are ongoing... Those who died due to the landslide, their bodies have been retrieved.” Rescue teams are still combing through debris and flood-hit areas amid fears of more missing persons. Helicopters were pressed into service due to washed-away roads and villages cut off from access.Train traffic disrupted on Jammu-Pathankot lineRail connectivity has been badly affected with the suspension of up-line train movement between Kathua and Budhi. Senior Divisional Commercial Manager, Jammu Railway Division, Uchit Singhal, said: “Due to heavy rains, water is flowing above the danger level through bridge number 43 between Kathua-Budhi. In view of this, temporarily till the water level subsides, up-line movement has been suspended, and in the meantime, up trains are being moved via a temporary single line through the down line track.” Villages cut off after flash floods and landslidesThe cloudburst snapped access to Jodh Ghati village, where floodwaters swept through homes and agricultural fields, leaving families stranded. Several connecting roads were washed away, and a bridge collapsed, worsening the situation. Deputy Commissioner Kathua Rajesh Sharma confirmed that rescue operations are underway and that stranded people are being shifted to safer areas. Local police reported that a station building in Kathua had also been damaged. Rescue operations led by Army and NDRFThe Indian Army, NDRF, SDRF, police and BRO have been deployed in full strength across Kathua. Heavy machinery has been brought in to fragment massive boulders that rolled down into residential areas. Inspector General of Police, Jammu Zone, Bhim Sen Tuti, said, “Boulders had fallen here which needed to be fragmented... Heavy machinery has been called for that. With the help of BRO, they are being fragmented here. These boulders are being removed by using explosives wherever needed, and bodies have been recovered from beneath them.”Helicopter evacuation for injured victimsUnion minister Jitendra Singh confirmed that helicopter services were arranged to shift injured people to nearby hospitals. In his social media post, Singh wrote, “Helicopter services have been arranged for shifting the injured to appropriate hospitals. 6 injured have been airlifted for hospitalisation in Mamoon, Pathankot, which was found to be relatively nearer destination.” DIG Police Shiv Kumar Sharma and his team are camping at the site and coordinating airlifts. Centre closely monitoring situation, says Amit ShahUnion home minister Amit Shah assured full support from the Central government. In a post on X, Shah wrote, “Spoke with the Lieutenant Governor and Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir regarding the cloudburst in Kathua. Relief and rescue operations are being carried out by the local administration, and NDRF teams have also been rushed to the site. Assured every support from the Modi government. We stand firmly behind our sisters and brothers of J&K.” LG Manoj Sinha calls tragedy 'mind-numbing'Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha expressed grief over the loss of lives. In his message on X, he wrote: “Deeply anguished by the loss of lives in the devastating rain-triggered landslides in several areas of Kathua. The tragedy is mind-numbing. Briefed Hon’ble Union Home Minister Sh. Amit Shah Ji on rescue and relief operations by the army, NDRF, SDRF, police & administration.” CM Omar Abdullah announces ex-gratia reliefChief minister Omar Abdullah conveyed condolences and directed immediate assistance for affected families. A statement from his office said Rs 2 lakh would be given for each deceased, Rs 1 lakh for severely injured, and Rs 50,000 for those with minor injuries. Compensation has also been announced for damaged homes: Rs 1 lakh for fully damaged houses, Rs 50,000 for severely damaged houses, and Rs 25,000 for partially damaged houses. “The Chief Minister has directed the administration to carry out immediate relief, rescue and evacuation measures to ensure the safety and support of affected families,” the statement said.Repeated cloudburst disasters in J&KThe Kathua disaster comes just three days after a cloudburst in Kishtwar’s Chisoti village killed 60 people and injured over 100. Experts warn that frequent extreme weather in J&K is linked to changing rainfall patterns and climate pressures in the Himalayan region. Officials say the back-to-back incidents highlight the need for stronger disaster preparedness and better drainage infrastructure. While the state government has sought central assistance, locals in Kathua have urged long-term flood protection measures. This includes improved embankments, real-time weather alerts, and a review of building norms in vulnerable areas.Connectivity and services slowly being restoredAuthorities are now focused on restoring essential services, including power, water and road links. In Kishtwar, where floods occurred earlier, officials said blasting of boulders was undertaken to clear blocked roads. Rope bridges are being built to reconnect cut-off villages in Kathua. “The power supply and water supply have been restored. A bridge is being built here with the help of the Army... All the passengers stranded in Machail were safely evacuated yesterday,” said Divisional Commissioner Ramesh Kumar.

A cruel summer as record wildfires scorch Europe
Wildfires continue to test firefighters and locals across Europe as droughts and heatwaves turn regions into tinderboxes. The data for 2025 alone is a sign of things to come.

The data for 2025 alone is a sign of things to come. A cruel summer as record wildfires scorch Europe Wildfires continue to burn across the south of Europe amid record-breaking summer heatwaves in many fire-prone regions. In some places, these fires have been exacerbated by wet spring months, which have helped vegetation growth capable of catching alight with ease during a dry summer.Already, an area equivalent to 1.5 times the size of Luxembourg — roughly 438,568 hectares — has burned across Europe in 2025. That figure is almost three times the size of fire damaged caused up to the same point in 2024.It comes as some parts of southern Europe suffer through multiple 40-degree (104 Fahrenheit) days, and prolonged heatwaves lasting a fortnight.The current summer has been described as the worst for wildfires in two decades.Where are the fires burning? What is the situation right now?"We're seeing extreme temperatures in large parts of Europe, records being broken of 40 degrees in many places," said Julie Berckmans, a climate scientist at the European Environmental Agency."Southern France, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Belgium, Netherlands, UK, are all hitting high temperatures [and] massive wildfires in Spain, Portugal, France, Greece, Turkey, Albania."In Spain, those fires have burned through an area the size of London already.Portugal is fighting its own fires, with around four thousand firefighters currently active across seven active sites. It has also been forced to request help from the European Union's firefighting forces.An even greater number of firefighters has been mobilized in Greece, which is battling 20 blazes during this peak fire season.Deaths have occurred in Spain, Portugal, Montenegro and Italy from fires and heat-related events this summer.It has been a severe fire seasonEurope uses data from its Copernicus satellite fleet to monitor fire activity, and collates the data via the European Forest Fires Information System (EFFIS).A substantial amount of fire damage in 2025 has already occured.More than 250,000 hectares more of land has burnt than the same time in 2024.There have more than 1,600 fires across Europe, compared to just under 1,100 last year.And new regions are also experiencing greater than usual fire activity.Spain, for instance, has seen twice as much of its territory burned-through compared to the 2006-2024 average. Romania has lost four times as much land to fires this year.Cyprus has been badly impacted. It could usually expect to see around 0.32% of its landmass burned each year. Already in 2025 it's 2.5% — nearly eight times more.But it's also the number of fires that is concerning. France has had nearly three times as many fires as average amid what has been the worst wildfire season for its southern regions in decades.More to come...The fallout of severe wildfires goes beyond land loss or human fatalities. Damage to ecosystems through vegetation loss, health impacts through smoke inhalation, and economic decline are all consequences of widespread fire events."It's about €2.5 billion [$2.9 billion] of damage lost every year in the EU," Berckmans told DW. "45,000 people on average were displaced due to wildfires from 2008 to 2023."The European Environment Agency's first climate risk assessment, published in 2024, found that urgent action is required to address the critical risk wildfires will pose to populations and infastructure and biodiversity in southern Europe."Wildfires are an urgent risk to address," said Berckmans. "It's also a major risk that needs more action now in the rest of Europe."As European fall approaches, the number of fires and the damage they cause should slow. However forecasting the length of fire danger season, and the behavior of fires themselves, is becoming more difficult.Climate change will not only generate warmer and drier conditions across southern Europe, it will also begin to change other dynamic factors.Faster and more volatile wind systems, for instance, will increase the challenge for fire management personnel to predict how blazes will behave. That puts the lives of emergency workers and civilians at greater risk."Picture a fire so fierce, so fast, and so unpredictable it seems alive, capable of reshaping the weather around it and leaping across kilometers in a heartbeat," said Antonio Lopez, an expert in wildfires at the University of Seville, Spain.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousNew blood pressure guideline by American Heart Association: Key takeawaysLifestyle‘Coolie’ star Shruti Haasan turns heads with her stunning style momentseEntertainmentAishwarya Khare’s off-screen chic lookstvIn pic: Radiant pictures of Shruti HaasanEntertainmentIn pics: Preity Mukhundhan’s stylish wardrobe collectionEntertainmentPallavi Gowda’s top 10 traditional lookstvSai Pallavi’s ethereal charmEntertainmentFatty liver disease: Warning signs one should not ignoreLifestyleJanhvi Kapoor’s mesmerising saree game is giving sleepless nights to other actresses!LifestyleA look at Sidharth Malhotra's dapper fashion momentsEntertainment Next123 Photostories  5 hints your friendship is costing your mental healthAkshay Kumar to Sourabh Raaj Jain : Actors who played Lord Krishna on screenWeird things snakes eat: From eggs to… themselves?

India is ahead in clean energy commitments, achieves 2030 goal five years early In what could be considered as a landmark moment for India's clean energy journey, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, from the ramparts of the Red Fort, on Friday announced that the nation has achieved its 50 per cent clean energy target in 2025 -- a full five years ahead of the 2030 deadline.Marking Independence Day celebrations, the Prime Minister announced and hailed the achievement as a pivotal step towards an Atmanirbhar Bharat in the energy sector, underscoring the country's transformation from a fossil-fuel-dependent importer to a global clean energy leader."When the world today expresses concern over global warming, I wish to tell the world that Bharat has resolved to achieve 50 per cent clean energy by 2030. That was our target for 2030. Look at the capability of my countrymen, look at their determination to fulfil the resolve of making Bharat developed--we achieved the 50 per cent clean energy target in 2025 itself, five years ahead of schedule. This is because we are as sensitive towards the world as we are responsible towards nature," PM Modi said on the occasion of 79th Independence.At COP26 held in 2021, India committed to an ambitious five-part "Panchamrit" pledge.This included reaching 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity, generating half of all energy requirements from renewables, and reducing emissions by 1 billion tonnes by 2030. India also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent and achieve net-zero emissions by 2070.According to the latest government data, India added a record 29.52 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity in 2024-25, taking total installed renewable energy (RE) capacity to 234.24 GW (excluding nuclear), up from 198.75 GW last year.Solar energy leads the charge, with installed capacity skyrocketing from just 2.82 GW in 2014 to 116.24 GW today, now accounting for nearly half of India's total RE capacity.Wind power follows at 51.67 GW, while large and small hydro contribute 54.72 GW combined. Biopower has also grown to 11.59 GW over the past decade.India now ranks 4th globally in total RE capacity, 3rd in solar power, and 4th in wind energy, boasting the world's fastest-growing renewable program.The clean energy surge has been powered by a suite of ambitious government reforms and programs.The PM-Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana, with a Rs 75,021 crore outlay, aims to provide free solar electricity to one crore households.As of August 14, 2025, over 17.24 lakh households have benefitted, with subsidies worth Rs 9,841.77 crore released. The scheme also introduced Model Solar Villages to promote decentralised clean power at the grassroots level.In agriculture, the PM-KUSUM scheme has installed over 8.53 lakh solar pumps, replacing diesel-powered systems and cutting an estimated 6.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.Beyond solar, India is expanding in wind, hydro, bioenergy, green hydrogen, and nuclear power. Offshore wind projects, backed by a Rs 7,453 crore viability gap funding scheme, are set to add 1 GW capacity off Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.The National Green Hydrogen Mission, with a Rs 19,744 crore budget, targets 5 million metric tonnes (MMT) annual production by 2030, along with 125 GW of new RE, Rs 8 lakh crore in investments, and 6 lakh jobs. Hydrogen hubs have been identified in Kandla, Paradip, and Tuticorin.In the nuclear sector, operational capacity has grown from 4,780 MW in 2014 to 8,780 MW across 25 reactors, with a remarkable 87 per cent plant load factor in 2024-25. Ten new reactors are already functional, and capacity is set to increase tenfold by 2047."The result is a virtuous cycle: local manufacturing creates jobs and resilience, competitive tariffs make clean energy affordable, and inclusive programs bring every citizen into the transition. As we look ahead to 2030 and beyond, India is not just meeting global commitments -- it is setting a new template for how a nation can grow, decarbonise, and remain self-reliant. In the journey from energy dependence to energy leadership, the momentum is unmistakable, and the destination is clear: an Atmanirbhar Bharat, powered by its own clean, green energy," the government said today, in a factsheet.With five years gained on its clean energy target, India is now firmly on track to meet, and potentially exceed, its 500 GW non-fossil capacity goal by 2030, positioning itself as a decisive force in the global fight against climate change.

But time is running out fast," he added. Representative image LONDON: A multi-million pound conservation programme in England helped save 150 struggling species but "time is running out" to halt the decline, the head of Natural England, which led the initiative, said Wednesday.The public body, responsible for protecting and enhancing England's natural environment, invested a £13 million ($17.6 million) grant in efforts to support animal and plant species such as water vole, oystercatcher, lady's slipper orchid, the hazel dormouse and Atlantic salmon. "From the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall to Cumbria and Northumberland, 63 different projects involving 78 partners have transformed landscapes and supported the recovery of 150 species, many of which were on the brink of national extinction, through research, captive breeding, habitat creation, and conservation translocations," the body said in a statement released Wednesday.More than 15,000 individual animals and plants were translocated to expand species territories under the projects, which ran from August 2023 to March 2025. Notable successes include the reintroduction of black grouse to the North Yorkshire Moors, northern England, and the return of the large marsh grasshopper to the Norfolk Broads in east England after an 85-year absence. Despite the achievements, the chair of Natural England Tony Juniper warned more needed to be done. "A rising number of nature recovery projects, both large and small, are making a huge difference up and down the country," he said in the press release."We know we can turn round species decline and improve ecosystems with the right targeted actions, the drive and the funding. But time is running out fast," he added.Juniper called for more projects, more volunteers and more investment, particularly from the private sector.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous10 creatures that can live inside volcanic zonesLifestyleYou’re probably a hater if you’re one of these zodiac signsastrologyHow to set up a planted aquarium at home and the types of fish to keep: 10-step guideLifestyle'Coolie': Rajinikanth to SoubinShahir'spay revealed!EntertainmentAlia Bhatt’s hairstylist warns against straightening damp hair: Know why we agree with himLifestyleZodiac signs who are known for their simplicityastrologyDO NOT ignore these warning signs of a heart attackLifestyleDipika Kakar’s top 10 gorgeous ethnic looks for festive seasontvJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than Wordstv Next123 Photostories  Janmashtami 2025: 5 savoury snacks perfect for fasting and feasting5 veggies to pair with Rajma (kidney beans) to boost its fiber contentThese foods can reduce the cooking time of meat5 last-minute weekend trips from Delhi you can plan right now!From Varsha to Divinesh: A look at the winners of Sa Re Ga Ma Pa TamilIndependence Day: Unveiling 10 rare pictures from India’s struggle for freedom7 foods to strictly avoid in monsoon seasonGuard deployed, protests erupt: National Guard steps up presence in Washington; 10 things to knowMovies that made us question everything we thought we knewSara Tendulkar’s protein drinks: How to make them and their benefits123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillVanessa BryantDwyane WadeKyrie lrvingNHL Trade RumorsRaj KundraWhy Roblox Get Banned in QatarMega Slowbro solo in Pokemon GOJohnny SomalisBrock Lesnar Net WorthTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteAir Arabia reports AED 415 million net profit in Q2 2025 despite regional disruptionsUAE heatwave alert: Temperatures to soar to 46°C in Dubai and Abu DhabiUAE: Etihad hits record 20.3 million passengers in 12 months for the first timeUkraine-Russia conflict: Zelenskyy arrives in London, meets UK PM Starmer ahead of Trump-Putin's Alaska summitWhat is David G.

Typhoon Podul intensifies as its near Taiwan
Typhoon Podul crossed southern Taiwan, prompting school and office closures due to heavy rain and potential agricultural damage. While no major damage was reported in Taiwan, one person is missing on the east coast. In China, coastal provinces evacuated around 15,000 residents as the storm moved towards the Taiwan Strait, impacting flights and regions south of Taipei.

KAOHSIUNG: Thousands of people sheltered and fishermen secured their boats across storm-battered southern Taiwan on Wednesday as Typhoon Podul intensified on its approach to the island.The typhoon is packing wind speeds of 155 kilometres (96 miles) per hour at its centre and "is strengthening", Central Weather Administration (CWA) forecaster Lin Ting-yi told AFP.Podul is on track to hit lightly populated Taitung County at around noon (0400 GMT) before sweeping across the island and into the Taiwan Strait."We are worried about this typhoon," Kaohsiung fisherman Huang Wei told AFP as he used more ropes to tie down his boat and checked on other vessels."We had already made general typhoon preparations yesterday, but this morning I woke up and saw news reports that the typhoon has intensified to be as strong as the last, (Typhoon) Krathon," Huang said."Last time, the two boats behind us weren't tied properly and hit my boat."Krathon slammed into Kaohsiung in October, with wind gusts of 162kph. Podul has gusts of 191kph, Lin said. More than 5,500 people have been evacuated from their homes ahead of Podul, disaster officials said Wednesday, as the typhoon threatens to pound central and southern regions that are still recovering from storms last month.Mountainous areas of Kaohsiung City and neighbouring Pingtung County, as well as Hualien and Taitung counties, could see torrential rain, the CWA said.All domestic flights across the island of 23 million people have been cancelled, along with dozens of international journeys.Many ferry services have been suspended and businesses and schools across the south closed.Typhoon Danas, which hit Taiwan in early July, killed two people and injured hundreds as the storm dumped more than 500mm (about 20 inches) of rain across the south over a weekend.That was followed by torrential rain from July 28 to August 4, with some areas recording more than Taiwan's rainfall of 2.1 metres for 2024.The week of bad weather left five people dead, three missing, and 78 injured, a disaster official said previously.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 expensive animal-shaped bags that’ll leave you almost shocked!Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?Maharashtra’s UNESCO World Heritage Sites and other iconic monuments for history loversRajinikanth completes 50 years in cinema: Lesser-known facts about the ‘Coolie’ star6 lizards that prove reptiles can be adorable123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

Momentum sagging at UN plastic pollution treaty talks
Talks on forging a landmark treaty to combat the scourge of plastic pollution were stumbling Saturday, with progress slow and countries wildly at odds on how far the proposed agreement should go. The talks are mandated to look at the full life cycle of plastic, from production to pollution, but some countries are unhappy with such a wide scope.

Representative image GENEVA: Talks on forging a landmark treaty to combat the scourge of plastic pollution were stumbling Saturday, with progress slow and countries wildly at odds on how far the proposed agreement should go.The negotiations, which opened on Tuesday, have four working days left to strike a legally-binding instrument that would tackle the growing problem choking the environment.In a blunt mid-way assessment, talks chair Luis Vayas Valdivieso warned the 184 countries negotiating at the United Nations that they had to get shifting to get a deal."Progress made has not been sufficient," Vayas told delegates."A real push to achieve our common goal is needed," the Ecuadoran diplomat said, adding that Thursday was not a just deadline but "a date by which we must deliver."Some articles still have unresolved issues and show little progress towards reaching a common understanding," Vayas lamented.The key fracture is between countries that want to focus on waste management and others who want a more ambitious treaty that also cuts production and eliminates use of the most toxic chemicals.And with the talks relying on finding consensus, it has become a game of brinkmanship.A diplomatic source told reporters that many informal meetings had been scrambled together for Sunday's day off to try and break the deadlock."If nothing changes, we won't get there," the source added.Battle of the bracketsCountries have reconvened in Geneva after the failure of the supposedly fifth and final round of negotiations in Busan, South Korea in 2024.After four days of talks, the draft text has ballooned from 22 to 35 pages -- with the number of brackets in the text going up near five-fold to almost 1,500 as countries insert a blizzard of conflicting wishes and ideas.The talks are mandated to look at the full life cycle of plastic, from production to pollution, but some countries are unhappy with such a wide scope.Kuwait spoke up for the so-called Like-Minded Group -- a nebulous cluster of mostly oil-producing nations which rejects production limits and wants to focus on treating waste."Let us agree on what we can agree. Consensus must be the basis of all our decisions," Kuwait insisted.Nudging in the same direction, Saudi Arabia, speaking for the Arab Group, said the responsible way ahead was to start considering what bits of the text "may not make it to the final outcome due to irreconcilable divergence".But given how little is truly agreed on, Uruguay warned that consensus "cannot be used as a justification to not achieve our objectives".Eirik Lindebjerg, global plastics adviser for the World Wide Fund for Nature, told AFP that the Like-Minded Group's proposal was "another attempt to make it a waste management agreement", and to stifle talks on reducing the amount of plastic in circulation.Path through the fogThe UN Environment Programme is hosting the talks and swiftly called a press conference after the stock-take session.UNEP executive director Inger Andersen said a deal was "really within our grasp, even though today it might not look so"."Despite the fog of negotiations I'm really encouraged," she told reporters, insisting: "There is a pathway to success."Vayas added: "We need to accelerate. We need a better rhythm in this and we need to also work in such a way that it will be clear that we will deliver by the end."Afterwards, Bjorn Beeler, executive director at IPEN, a global network aimed at limiting toxic chemicals, told AFP: "This whole process has not been able to take decisions and is still collecting ideas. We're sleepwalking towards a cliff and if we don't wake up, we're falling off."'Profits from poisoning'Plastic pollution is so ubiquitous that microplastics have been found on the highest mountain peaks, in the deepest ocean trench and scattered throughout almost every part of the human body.More than 400 million tonnes of plastic are produced globally each year, half of which is for single-use items.Plastic production is set to triple by 2060.Panama's negotiator Juan Monterrey Gomez took the floor to slam those countries wanting to stop the treaty from encompassing the entire life cycle of plastic.He said microplastics "are in our blood, in our lungs and in the first cry of a new-born child. Our bodies are living proof of a system that profits from poisoning us". "We cannot recycle our way out of this crisis."End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksGlobal Standard indexUS stocks todayIndia-US tariffIntel CEOMukesh AmbaniUS jobless dataRussia crude oilTop TrendingTyreek HillSelena GomezKim KardashianTaylor SwiftTravis KelceBill Belichicks GirlfriendNBA Trade RumorsDwyane WadesShannon SharpeMike VrabelTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteTyreek Hill, ex Keeta Vaccaro rush baby Capri to ER;

Climate heat extremes driving tropical bird decline: study
Tropical bird populations have plummeted not only due to deforestation but also extreme heat attributable to climate change, according to a study published on Monday in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.  Another study published in 2017 showed how some tropical hummingbirds are now forced to seek shade to regulate their temperature in extreme heat, cutting into the amount of time they can spend searching for life-sustaining nectar.

Another study published in 2017 showed how some tropical hummingbirds are now forced to seek shade to regulate their temperature in extreme heat, cutting into the amount of time they can spend searching for life-sustaining nectar.  Representative image PARIS: Tropical bird populations have plummeted not only due to deforestation but also extreme heat attributable to climate change, according to a study published on Monday in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. Intensifying temepratures caused a 25-38 percent reduction in tropical bird populations between 1950 and 2020, compared to a scenario without manmade global warming, scientists based in Europe and Australia reported. "The findings are pretty stark," lead author Maximilian Kotz, a researcher at the National Supercomputing Centre in Barcelona and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), told AFP.Bird populations in the tropics now face 30 days of heat extremes per year compared to three per year in the mid-20th century, he noted. "This has major consequences for how we think about biodiversity conservation," Kotz said by email. "Protecting pristine habitats is crucial, but without dealing with climate change it won't be enough for birds."Nearly half of all bird species are found in biodiversity-rich tropical regions. These often colourful animals perform essential services for ecosystems, such as dispersing plant seeds. Invasive species another threatBut birds living in these regions may already be "close to the limits" of their tolerance to high temperatures, which can cause heatstroke (hyperthermia) or dehydration. The overview study does not provide figures for individual species, but earlier literature is rich with examples of the devastating impact of rising temperatures.One documented the heat-related decline of birds in Panama, including the king quetzal, the red-crested quetzal, the two-coloured kingfisher and the aurora trogon. Another study published in 2017 showed how some tropical hummingbirds are now forced to seek shade to regulate their temperature in extreme heat, cutting into the amount of time they can spend searching for life-sustaining nectar. Extreme heat waves, which are becoming more frequent, represent a far greater threat than increases in average temperatures or rainfall, another result of human-induced climate change. Up to now, it has been assumed that the decline in bird populations worldwide was due mainly to other well-identified factors, especially habitat loss, pesticide use, hunting, and invasive species, especially snakes that snack on bird eggs and mosquitos carrying avian malaria. But the new findings "challenge the view that direct human pressures have so far been the dominant driver of impacts on bird populations compared to climate change in tropical regions," according to the authors. To reach this conclusion, they analysed observational data from more than 3,000 bird populations around the world and used statistical modelling to isolate the effects of extreme weather from other factors.The findings help complete the picture of tropical bird decline, noted Aimee Van Tatenhove, a post-doctoral fellow at Cornell University's Center for Avian Population Studies who was not involved in the study."Deforestation has an obvious impact -- trees are cut and habitat is destroyed," she told AFP. "We need long-term datasets like the authors used to understand how extreme temperatures impact avian populations.""This study is an important reminder that we need to continue examining different causes of population declines and apply those findings to conservation initiatives," she continued.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  From Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leavesTop 5 Getaways in North and South India to Work RemotelyFrom Cristiano Ronaldo’s million-dollar sparkler to Arjun Tendulkar’s intimate proposal: Celebrity engagements that created buzz in 2025Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 expensive animal-shaped bags that’ll leave you almost shocked!Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

Silopi, a city in the Sirnak province, is located around 10 kilometres from the Iraq and Syrian borders. It shattered the previous national high of 49.5 C recorded in August 2023 in the western province of Eskisehir. Turkey has faced weeks of scorching heat along with several wildfires. Fourteen people lost their lives battling blazes last month in the western part of the country. Hundreds of people were evacuated on Friday in the northwest province of Canakkale, where the busy Dardanelles Strait was closed to maritime traffic due to two raging fires. The heatwave has also prompted fears of water shortages in some areas. The resort town of Cesme on the Aegean Sea has restricted tap water for residents and tourists between 11:00 pm to 6:00 am since July 25.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksGlobal Standard indexUS stocks todayIndia-US tariffIntel CEOMukesh AmbaniUS jobless dataRussia crude oilTop TrendingTyreek HillSelena GomezKim KardashianTaylor SwiftTravis KelceBill Belichicks GirlfriendNBA Trade RumorsDwyane WadesShannon SharpeMike VrabelTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteTyreek Hill, ex Keeta Vaccaro rush baby Capri to ER;

Representative image (Image: AP) LAGRASSE: A wildfire in southern France slowed overnight into Wednesday after injuring nine people and burning through 11,000 hectares of vegetation, local officials said. The blaze, which started on Tuesday afternoon, is still threatening several villages in the aude department, where 1,500 firefighters have been battling to extinguish it."The fire is advancing in an area where all the conditions are ripe for it to progress. We are monitoring the edges and the back of the fire to prevent flare-ups," said Lucie Roesch, secretary general of the qude prefecture.She said firefighters are expecting to receive aerial support at dawn, but warned "this fire will keep us busy for several days. It's a long-term operation".The fire's advance slowed overnight due to high humidity levels, she added.One person was seriously burned and another injured, the prefecture said, adding that seven firefighters were also hurt. Camping grounds and one village were partially evacuated, and several local roads have been closed."All of the Nation's resources are mobilised," French president Emmanuel Macron said on X, while calling on people to exercise "the utmost caution".The qude department has seen an increase in areas burnt in recent years, aggravated by low rainfall and the removal of vineyards, which used to help break the progression of fires.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle10 baby names that mean creativity and visionLifestyleWhen looks can be deceptive: 10 ‘PRETTY’ killers in the animal worldLifestyleBirthday Special: Spine-chilling quotes of Alfred Hitchcock that will keep you up at nightLifestyleSet up a mini lotus pond at home with these easy tipsLifestyleAttractive looks of Srithika Saneeshtv10 creatures that can walk on waterLifestyleSheet masks out, Kareena Kapoor Khan’s DIY napkin mask inLifestyleBhagyashri Borse charms with her gorgeous outfitsEntertainmentMost affordable diesel cars under Rs 12 lakh: Kia Syros, Mahindra Thar and moreauto Next123 Photostories  6 lizards that prove reptiles can be adorableHow to unrot your brain: 5 effective steps to sharpen focus and boost mental clarityFrom Mullum Malarum to Kabali: Rajinikanth’s most emotional movies that fans still cherishLegends reborn – Bollywood actors who came back strongKyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi 2: Smriti Irani, Amar Upadhyay and other stars' educational qualificationGreen, pink and purple — jaw-dropping Northern Lights photos you won’t believe are realFrom Munshi Ranjeet to David John: Bigg Boss Malayalam contestants who faced first-week evictionAdorable baby shower photos of Bigg Boss Telugu fame Soniya'RRR,' 'Kaalapani,' and 'Major': South Indian films that celebrate IndiaNayanthara's classic films to watch123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillJessica RadcliffeLebron JamesBasanti ChatterjeePatrick MahomesGautam AdaniElon MuskIndia Nayara EnergyCJI GavaiBengaluru Student AttackTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteImmigration crackdown: Venezuelan civic groups sue Trump admin over termination of Temporary Protected Status; call it cruelty towards vulnerableFormer Platters band member Sandra Hall goes missing, last seen on Friday in Brooklyn; search under wayUAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed sends firefighting team to aid Albania’s wildfire battleRoad safety improves sharply in Kuwait: Accidents down 45%, deaths down 34% in first half of 2025Kuwait: No more minimum salary requirement for family visit visas, what expats need to knowTurkish Airlines and Oman Air frequent flyer partnership: Travelers can now earn miles across both airlines‘Take our capital back’: Nearly 800 troops deployed by Donald Trump arrive at DC; 23 individuals arrested overnightBahrain stands tall: Ranks 3rd in Arab region in new UN Human Development reportUAE: What is Abu Dhabi's ‘Hayat’ program?

AI image ALGIERS: At a beach near Algiers, brown algae native to the Pacific Ocean cover the golden sand, posing a threat to ecosystems native to the area and their stench repelling swimmers at the peak of summer.Following a recent government call to help clear beaches swarmed by the seaweed species known scientifically as Rugulopteryx okamurae, several volunteers and charities have stepped in."When it washes up, we can't swim," said Salim Hemmedi, a 43-year-old vacationer at a beach in Sidi Fredj, where volunteers raked up heaps of the plant."We hope the situation will improve so that we can enjoy ourselves... and that children can swim in peace."The alga originates from temperate waters around Japan and the Korean peninsula in the northwest Pacific Ocean.It was first spotted in Algeria in late 2023, according to Lamia Bahbah, a lecturer and researcher at the National School of Marine Sciences and Coastal Planning.And lately, some have noted that it has been increasingly washed ashore.Youcef Segni, a marine engineer and biologist, said the algae proliferated at a significantly higher rate than in 2023 and 2024."They invade the habitats of other algae in the seabed, which leads to the disappearance of some species," he said, adding that it can also displace some native fish.Fast reproductionIn France, Spain and Portugal, the Rugulopteryx okamurae species has also been observed.Earlier this year, Spanish football club Real Betis introduced kits repurposed from seaweed to raise awareness about the issue.A 2023 study by the Marine Drugs journal said the alga's invasive character led to "a replacement of the native biota and an occupancy rate that reached almost 100 per cent in some locations" in Portugal.In Algeria, the plant has been spotted in at least three of the country's 14 coastal provinces, including the capital where 16 beaches are affected, authorities said."Are the waters suitable for swimming? Yes," said Environment Minister Nadjiba Djilali during the cleanup campaign, adding there were no records of the plant causing allergies.Researcher Bahbah said stopping its proliferation was "unfortunately impossible at this stage".She said the plant reproduces at a high rate, both sexually and asexually.The species can reproduce through fragmentation, meaning new individual algae can develop from fragmented pieces of other Rugulopteryx okamurae algae.The algae spread mainly by clinging to the hulls of boats, and the Mediterranean's moderate temperature favours the seaweed's fast reproduction."We are going to fight it," said Fella Zaboudj, a state engineer in marine sciences, adding that researchers were monitoring its spread, development and evolution.Zaboudj said research was also underway to determine whether the algae could be repurposed as fertiliser.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksSibu SorenPatna Double Decker BridgeSpiceJetRBI MPC MeetRussia OilUS China TradeNSDL IPO allotmentTop TrendingTrinity RodmanDe'Aaron FoxConnor BedardDennis RodmanRussell WilsonMitch MarnersKirby DachMatthew TkachukConnor McDavidAdam RuzickaTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website'Will raise tariff substantially in 24 hours': Donald Trump fires fresh salvo;

Ireland's wind energy sector has long been touted as full of potential. AI image BANGOR: On Ireland's blustery western seaboard, researchers are gleefully flying giant kites, not for fun but in the hope of generating renewable electricity and sparking a "revolution" in wind energy."We use a kite to capture the wind and a generator at the bottom of it that captures the power," Padraic Doherty of Kitepower, the Dutch firm behind the venture, told AFP. At its test site in operation since September 2023 near the small town of Bangor Erris, the team transports the vast 60-square-metre (645,000-square-feet) kite from a hangar across the lunar-like bogland to a generator. The kite is then attached by a cable tether to the machine and acts like a "yo-yo or fishing reel", Doherty said."It gets cast out and flies up, the tether pulls it back in, over and over again, creating energy," he said, testing the kite's ropes and pulleys before a flight.The sparsely populated spot near the stormy Atlantic coast is the world's first designated airborne renewable energy test site. And although the idea is still small in scale, it could yet prove to be a mighty plan as Ireland seeks to cut its reliance on fossil fuels such as oil and gas."We are witnessing a revolution in wind energy," said Andrei Luca, operations head at Kitepower, a zero-emissions energy solutions spin-off from the Delft University of Technology."It took nearly 25 years for wind turbines to evolve from 30-kilowatt prototypes to megawatt scale, and decades to offshore wind farms we see today," he added.The system flies autonomously, driven by software developed at the university in the Netherlands, but Doherty acts as the kite's "pilot" on the ground, monitoring its flight path for efficiency. The kite flies up around 400 metres (1,300 feet) and reels in to about 190 metres, generating around 30 kilowatts for storage.The force spins "like a dynamo on a bike", Doherty said, adding that "it generates up to two and a half tonnes of force through each turn".The electricity is stored in batteries, similar to solar photovoltaic systems, with the kite currently able to fully charge a 336-kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery."That's a meaningful amount of energy, sufficient for powering a remote outpost, a small island, polar station, or even a construction site," Luca said."Add additional kites and we can power a bigger island."'Mobile, flexible'According to Doherty, a chief advantage of the kite system is its flexibility and swift start-up capability."We can set up in 24 hours and can bring it anywhere, it's super mobile, and doesn't need expensive, time- and energy-consuming turbine foundations to be built," he said. A kite system is "way less invasive on the landscape (than wind turbines), produces clean energy and doesn't need a supply chain of fuel to keep running", Luca added.During January's Storm Eowyn, which caused widespread and long-lasting power outages in Ireland, the system showed its value in Bangor Erris, according to Luca. "Paired with a battery, it provided uninterrupted electricity before, during and after the storm," he said. Ireland's wind energy sector has long been touted as full of potential.But progress on large-scale delivery of onshore and offshore turbines has been held up by planning delays and electricity grid capacity constraints.The Irish government has set ambitious targets for offshore wind energy to deliver 20 gigawatts of energy by 2040 and at least 37 gigawatts by 2050.In 2024, Irish wind farms provided around a third of the country's electricity according to Wind Energy Ireland (WEI), a lobby group for the sector. This compares to the UK, where, according to trade association RenewableUK, wind energy from the country's combined wind farms first reached 20 gigawatts in November 2022.The ability of airborne wind energy (AWE) systems to harness high-altitude winds with relatively low infrastructure requirements "makes them particularly suitable for remote, offshore or mobile applications," Mahdi Salari, an AWE researcher at University College Cork, told AFP.But he said Kitepower would face challenges on "regulation, safety, and system reliability". Such technology however could plug gaps in places where "land availability, costs or logistical constraints hinder the deployment of traditional wind turbines", Salari said.By the 2030s, he said: "I expect AWE to contribute meaningfully to diversified, flexible and distributed renewable energy networks".Discover stories of India’s leading eco-innovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksSibu SorenPatna Double Decker BridgeSpiceJetGold Price PredectionRussia OilUS China TradeNSDL IPO allotmentTop TrendingRussell WilsonHailee SteinfeldsF1 StandingsDez BryantLebron James WifeRussia Oil ImportsTriple HPrince HarryRJ MahvashAntonio BrownTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteBrooke Hogan’s husband: Hulk Hogan showed no interest in meeting grandkidsDak Prescott builds new mansion, reveals why he razed the last oneTaylor Swift’s Kelce jacket inspires Kristin Juszczyk’s new NFL lineGabrielle Union on menopause: 'It makes it hard' — motherhood now more emotional, exhaustingGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai to employees: ‘I think we have to....'Apple CEO Tim Cook confirms: Majority of new iPhones sold in the US are 'made' in India;

Aalborg Zoo in Denmark is now accepting unwanted small pets as donations to feed its predators. The zoo assures that donated animals like rabbits and guinea pigs will be humanely euthanized before being used as food. This initiative aims to mimic the natural food chain, promoting animal welfare and natural behaviour among captive carnivores.

This initiative aims to mimic the natural food chain, promoting animal welfare and natural behaviour among captive carnivores. (Ai generated image)  If you have a pet you can no longer keep, one zoo in Denmark is offering an unusual option.Aalborg Zoo is asking the public to donate small pets — not for rehoming, but to be used as food for its captive predators.Aalborg Zoo, located in northern Denmark, said in a Facebook post that the move is meant to mimic the natural food chain of animals housed there. The zoo says this effort supports “animal welfare and professional integrity,” and assures that any donated pets will be “gently euthanized” by trained staff.“If you have a healthy animal that needs to be given away for various reasons, feel free to donate it to us,” the post said.The zoo lists rabbits, guinea pigs, horses and chickens as examples of suitable donations.PollWhat do you think about Aalborg Zoo's practice of accepting pets for food for predators?Support it for animal welfareOppose it, find other solutionsOnce euthanised, the animals will be used as fodder for the zoo’s carnivores.“That way, nothing goes to waste — and we ensure natural behaviour, nutrition and well-being of our predators,” the zoo claimed.The post is accompanied by a picture of a wildcat showing its teeth with its mouth wide open. It also includes a link to the zoo’s website.About the zoo Aalborg Zoo was founded in April 1935. The facility is located near the centre of Aalborg and spans 8 hectares. It houses more than 1,500 animals across 126 species and draws hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.According to the zoo’s official website, Aalborg Zoo focuses on conservation, sustainability and education.It takes part in international breeding programmes for endangered species and supports global efforts in animal conservation, research and fair trade. It was also the first zoo in Denmark to receive an environment certificate and is known for its work in protecting nature and the environment.The zoo maintains that the practice of using donated pets as prey aligns with its mission to support natural behaviours in captive predators.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

LISBON: Portugal's government on Saturday issued an alert warning of a heatwave with a high risk of fires in large parts of the country in the coming days.The alert, covering Sunday to Thursday, included a ban on bonfires, fireworks and the use of electrical equipment in forests.The authorities also restricted access to some woodland areas, announced a boost in staffing for the forest ranger service and increased land and air patrols in high fire-risk areas."The next week will be difficult" said Home Affairs Minister Maria Lucia Amaral.Both Portugal and neighbouring Spain have had to battle wildfires in the recent days, a problem they and other countries face every year.Experts say climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of droughts and fires around the world.Following the deadly fire season in 2017, Portugal ramped up its spending on wildfire prevention and response. More than 29,000 hectares (71,600 acres) have already been destroyed by fire since the beginning of the year, according to Portugal's Institute of Forests (ICNF).End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous'Kingom' actor Vijay Deverakonda’s stylish looksEntertainmentVijay Deverakonda’s fitness workout routineEntertainmentTop 10 colour-changing birds of IndiaLifestyleRaksha Bandhan-worthy mehendi designs to try this yearLifestyle10 things to know before getting an Arowana fish for good luckLifestyleMouni Roy’s top 10 gorgeous ethnic lookstvPriya Prakash Varrier serves fierce fashionEntertainmentSouth Actresses dazzle in this week's best photosEntertainmentMost popular baby names of 2024Lifestyle9 Ayurvedic habits to regulate the nervous systemLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Bigg Boss Malayalam 7 contestants Adhila and Noora: All about the lesbian couple who fought a legal battle for loveWhen fame faded Mahima Chaudhry chose to fight not fall5 snake parks in India that are absolutely fang-tastic and what makes them special5 things to know before drinking water in a copper bottleBigg Boss Malayalam 7 contestant Rena Fathima: Who is this 19-year-old influencer?From ‘DDLJ’ to ‘Saiyaara’: 5 Bollywood love stories that gave us hopeful, happy endingsHollywood's 7 BFFs whose friendship stood the test of timeThe Great Indian Kapil Show: From a luxurious house in Madh Island worth approximately Rs 12 crore to net worth, car collection; Archana Puran Singh’s lavish life'Coolie' audio launch highlights: Star-studded speeches, roaring cheers & a grand tribute to Rajinikanth—everything you should not missFrom Thummanpeta to Stardom:Meet the family behind Vijay Deverakonda’s stardom123Hot PicksKamala HarrisIndian NavyJ&K landslideTrump TariffsUPI New RulesGST collectionsJulia HymanTop TrendingWWE Summerslam HighlightsHailee SteinfeldsTop Richest Billionaries in the worldEarthquake VideoLebron James WifeRJ MahvashGerman Influencer BengaluruKannada signboard ruleNayara EnergyIndia US Crude OilTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteHailee Steinfeld's latest workout photos break the internetGabrielle Union on menopause: 'It makes it hard' — motherhood now more emotional, exhaustingIND vs ENG Live: India need eight wickets to level the series 2-2Who is Matt Deitke?

Video/PTI NEW DELHI: Continuous heavy rainfall on Saturday brought large parts of Bihar’s capital Patna to a standstill, causing severe waterlogging and traffic congestion. Visuals from Kurji Road and other low-lying areas showed flooded streets, traffic jams, and pedestrians struggling to navigate waterlogged roads.Kerala Hit by Earliest Monsoon Since 2009 | IMD Predicts Above-Normal Rainfall for 2025The flood-like situation disrupted normal life and exposed administrative lapses in monsoon preparedness. Despite repeated assurances by civic authorities about improved drainage systems and better planning, the city appeared unprepared once again.Commuters faced long traffic jams in various parts of the city, as vehicles were stuck or slowed down due to waterlogging. Pedestrians were seen wading through flooded roads with extreme caution, fearing open manholes, uncovered drains, and the threat of electric shocks from submerged wires and poles.PollWhat do you think is the biggest issue causing urban flooding during monsoon?Poor drainage systemsLack of planning and maintenanceMeanwhile, the India Meteorological Department has predicted heavy rainfall in the region over the next few days.Moreover, contaminated water triggered a diarrhea outbreak in Bihar's Jehanabad.

House razings to save Niger capital's forest shield dismay locals
Hamissou Issiakou grumbled as he worked to strip bare his house, marked for demolition for illegally encroaching on the tip of green forest that's keeping the expanding desert at bay from Niger's capital. Director General of Water and Forests within the environment ministry Yacouba Seybou said on state television that since 2004 "decrees have prohibited housing in the (green) belt".

Director General of Water and Forests within the environment ministry Yacouba Seybou said on state television that since 2004 "decrees have prohibited housing in the (green) belt". Representative image (AFP) NIAMEY: Hamissou Issiakou grumbled as he worked to strip bare his house, marked for demolition for illegally encroaching on the tip of green forest that's keeping the expanding desert at bay from Niger's capital.His is one of nearly 500 homes being bulldozed as the authorities in the arid desert country, which is particularly at risk from man-made global warming, seek to shore up the wooded belt around Niamey's outskirts.Ukraine Launches MASSIVE Drone Attack On Russia; 3 Killed, Over 100 UAVs Shot Down"We've bought our plots of land at great expense. In the end it's a big waste," Issiakou told AFP, after urging workers to hurry up and remove an enormous gate before the police arrive. Since the heavy machinery began rolling in at the end of June, dozens of slums, luxury houses and apartment blocks have tumbled like a house of cards.Some homeowners have just stood by and watched in dismay as the bulldozers tore down their houses. Others, like Issiakou, have rushed to remove anything of value before the two-week notice period was up, from windows, metal sheets and electrical cables to small drinking water tanks and surveillance cameras.All say they bought their land from private real-estate agencies. - 'Submit to Allah' -In a country with one of the highest population growth rates in the world, the number of residents in Niamey has doubled since 2005, from 750,000 to one-and-a-half million, according to the national statistics institute. Thanks to that rapid urbanisation, the forest belt has lost more than half its area since it was completed in 1993 and now measures just 25 kilometres (16 miles) long and a kilometre wide. Hailing from various social classes, the woods' soon-to-be-gone inhabitants were originally attracted to the capital's outskirts by the good quality of life and reasonable cost of a plot. The distance from the bureaucracy within Niamey proper, which can often delay construction projects by years, did not hurt either. Thermos in hand, Aboul-Razak Moussa handed out coffee to the workmen using crowbars to dig up the cobblestones in the courtyard of his brand-new building."I bought the land for 12 million CFA francs ($21,000) and invested 127 million CFA francs (more than $220,000) to build my building," the owner of a welding company lamented."We submit ourselves to Allah." Businessman Ali Hamza was indignant."We're in the peak of the rainy season, it's inhuman," the father-of-10 argued. So far, at least 4,000 people have been evicted and nearly 500 homes, mostly slums, demolished, authorities say.- Rising temperatures -Carparks, petrol stations, pharmacies, shops, rubbish dumps and health centres sprung up to cater for those who made their home in the forested area.The project to introduce a green belt around Niamey is not part of the African Union's flagship Great Green Wall initiative, but its aims are the same.Landlocked Niger lies in the heart of the Sahel, a semiarid region stretching from Senegal to Sudan where temperatures are rising 1.5 times faster than the global average.At the same time, Niger suffers periods of drought and severe flooding.It is "imperative" that Niger "preserves more green spaces", Sani Ayouba, head of the Young Volunteers for the Environment NGO said.Director General of Water and Forests within the environment ministry Yacouba Seybou said on state television that since 2004 "decrees have prohibited housing in the (green) belt".Under the law, offenders face three months to two years in prison.Former ministers have "authorised private housing developments", Boubacar Maman, an official at the urban planning ministry, said.The environment ministry says a zoo and aquatic park as well as a botanic garden, sports and leisure area will soon be created within the forested green belt.bh/bam/bdi/sbk-kjm/yadEnd of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousTransform your boring sandals with trendy DIY embellishmentsLifestyleBhagyashri Borse's style statementsEntertainmentFrom Pulitzer to Orange: 10 prestigious awards given for LiteratureLifestyle10 veggies that can grow in containers in balconyLifestyle'Kingom' actor Vijay Deverakonda’s stylish looksEntertainmentVijay Deverakonda’s fitness workout routineEntertainmentTop 10 colour-changing birds of IndiaLifestyleRaksha Bandhan-worthy mehendi designs to try this yearLifestyle10 things to know before getting an Arowana fish for good luckLifestyleMouni Roy’s top 10 gorgeous ethnic lookstv Next123 Photostories  Top 6 zoos to visit across India for a complete wildlife experience10 minute daily habits that are perfect brain exercisesBigg Boss Malayalam 7 Contestant Aryan Kathuria: All about the handsome actor featured in a Poonam Pandey show6 healthy smart foods for babies when their teeth hurtFrom white themed rooms to aesthetic details: Debinna Bonnerjee’s living and bedroom give peaceful vibesHow to spend 5 days in Madhya Pradesh: The perfect Orchha–Khajuraho itineraryRisk of type 1 diabetes may depend on where childhood is spentBigg Boss Malayalam 7 contestant Abhisree: All about the actor-dancer with an inspiring journey5 filling foods under 50 calories7 key boundaries mentally strong people set to thrive at work123Hot PicksKamala HarrisIndian NavyJ&K landslideTrump TariffsUPI New RulesGST collectionsJulia HymanTop TrendingWWE Summerslam HighlightsHailee SteinfeldsTop Richest Billionaries in the worldEarthquake VideoLebron James WifeRJ MahvashGerman Influencer BengaluruKannada signboard ruleNayara EnergyIndia US Crude OilTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire Website'Disgraceful': Ex-South Korea president Yoon Suk Yeol resists questioning by laying down in underwear;

Southeastern Turkey is reeling under a record-breaking heatwave, with temperatures exceeding 50C in Silopi. Residents are struggling with soaring electricity bills due to constant air conditioning use and are appealing for state support. Deforestation and policy changes allowing mining on agricultural lands exacerbate the heat, intensifying the challenges faced by locals who depend on air conditioning as a necessity.

Residents are struggling with soaring electricity bills due to constant air conditioning use and are appealing for state support. Deforestation and policy changes allowing mining on agricultural lands exacerbate the heat, intensifying the challenges faced by locals who depend on air conditioning as a necessity. Representative Image  A choking heatwave left astonished locals in southeastern Turkey calling for state help to pay their air conditioning bills after the temperature surged past 50 degree celsius."We cannot cope with the heat," ice-cream maker Recep Esiyok, 59, told AFP in Silopi, where meteorologists measured 50.5C on Friday -- a national record."I've been living in Silopi for about 30 years. I've never seen such heat... I've never seen such heat anywhere."He is getting through the heatwave thanks to the air conditioner in his shop, but is now worried about paying for the electricity."My bill last month was 59,000 lira (1,450 dollars). We are asking for state support on this issue."'Incomparable' heat: Before Friday's record, the previous peak in Turkey had been 49.5 degree celsius in August 2023.Scientists agree that climate change caused by humans burning fossil fuels is increasing the likelihood, length and intensity of heatwaves."The heat has reached a point where it's incomparable to previous years," said Halil Coskun, 52, a local reporter.The country is still in the grip of the heatwave and since Sunday temperatures overall have surged from six to 12 degrees above seasonal norms, according to the state meteorology directorate.Wildfire threat: Turkey has fought fires in several regions since the start of the summer. Last week, 10 people perished while fighting a fire in Eskisehir province.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday the country has experienced drier conditions than normal over the past five years as a result of global warming."Extreme heat, low humidity, and strong winds are unfortunately increasing the risk of fire," he said.He said the state was using drones to monitor and protect forests.The streets were relatively empty and the atmosphere tense in Silopi, a Kurdish city whose main income is trade with Iraq across the border 10 kilometres (six miles) away."When it's hot, there's no one outside during the day," said Esiyok.Deforestation complaints: Other locals complained at the lack of vegetation to provide relief around the town, which lies at the foot of a mountain."Unfortunately, the forests here were burned in the past for security reasons," said Coskun.He said the Turkish army cleared them in the search for fighters from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a rebel group that recently disarmed.Turkey's parliament this month also passed a bill that opens certain agricultural lands including olive groves to mining activities, despite widespread opposition."We could at least minimise the heat by planting trees, not by felling them," Coskun said.Electricity bills: Sweating in his kebab shop, another local, Cemil Seher, said that summers in Silopi last not three months, but five.For Seher, 51, air conditioning is no longer a luxury but a necessity."AC is essential here as much as bread and water," he said."When the air conditioners are running, the electricity bills are very high," he said, demanding authorities offer discounts for businesses."I want a discount not only for Silopi but for the entire region from here to Sanliurfa" in the east, he said."I am not making a profit because I've been working... to pay my electricity bill."Discover stories of India’s leading eco-innovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksKamala HarrisBogota AirportUS Oil ReserveTrump TariffsUPI New RulesStarlink SatelliteJulia HymanTop TrendingTravis KelceTom BradyBengaluru Boy Kidnap MurderCBSE Class 10th Sample PapersHow new nep rule worksYuzvendra Chahal DatingStephen CurryJoe BurrowBlake LivelyTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website40 jobs AI can't touch in 2025, says Microsoft Research: Is your career on the list?Former PM HD Devegowda's grandson Prajwal Revanna convicted for raping 47-year-old domestic helpIND vs ENG Live: Rain likely to play spoilsport as India eye 300; Woakes ruled outUPI new rules 2025: New NPCI changes kick in from August 1 - All you need to knowSSC exam 2025 glitches spark massive nationwide protest: Here’s why #SSCMisManagement is trending on social mediaCAT 2025 registration begins at iimcat.ac.in: Check direct link to apply online hereAP Police Constable final result 2025 released at slprb.ap.gov.in; check direct link hereIs Yuzvendra Chahal dating RJ Mahvash?

Chinese sub discovers deepest-ever creatures 10 km undersea
A Chinese submersible has discovered thousands of worms and molluscs nearly 10 kilometres (six miles) below sea level in the Mariana Trench, the deepest colony of creatures ever observed, a study revealed on Wednesday. Last year, the Chinese submersible "Fendouzhe" -- or "Striver" -- dove 23 times into the depths of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean with researchers on board, according to the study in the journal Nature.

Last year, the Chinese submersible "Fendouzhe" -- or "Striver" -- dove 23 times into the depths of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean with researchers on board, according to the study in the journal Nature. AP file photo PARIS: A Chinese submersible has discovered thousands of worms and molluscs nearly 10 kilometres (six miles) below sea level in the Mariana Trench, the deepest colony of creatures ever observed, a study revealed on Wednesday.The discovery in Earth's deepest underwater valley suggests that there could be much more life thriving in the hostile conditions at the bottom of our planet's largely unexplored oceans than previously thought, the China-led team of scientists said.Almost all life on Earth is supported by light from the Sun. However, in the total darkness at the bottom of the world, these creatures live off of chemicals such as methane seeping through cracks in the seafloor, a process called chemosynthesis.Last year, the Chinese submersible "Fendouzhe", or "Striver", dove 23 times into the depths of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean with researchers on board, according to the study in the journal Nature.They found colonies of thousands of marine tubeworms and molluscs called bivalves at depths ranging from 2,500 to 9,533 metres (8,200 to 31,000 feet) deep. Video released alongside the study showed fields of tubeworms, which grew up to 30 centimetres (12 inches) long, as well as piles of molluscs and clams. Spiky crustaceans, free-floating marine worms, sea cucumbers, feathery-armed sea lilies and other invertebrates were also recorded in the depths.The study marked "the discovery of the deepest and the most extensive chemosynthesis-based communities known to exist on Earth," its authors said.Given that other ocean trenches are similar, "such chemosynthesis-based communities might be more widespread than previously anticipated," they added.The researchers said they also found "compelling evidence" that methane was being produced by microbes, with the tubeworms tending to cluster around microbial mats that resemble snow. Previous studies have found thriving communities of single-cell organisms on the ocean floor, but few large animals.But a remotely operated vehicle discovered tubeworms and other marine invertebrates living in hydrothermal vents in the crust below the seafloor two kilometres deep in the Pacific, research said last year.Pressure rising The new study was published as nations wrangle over the contentious issue of deep-sea mining. China, the United States and others have expressed interest in mining the depths for valuable minerals.Ocean scientists warn that mining the little-explored seafloor, one of the last wild zones on the planet, could decimate fragile ecosystems that are not yet well understood.Despite recent talks, the International Seabed Authority -- which oversees deep-sea mining in international waters -- has yet to adopt long-awaited rules governing the industry. Chinese media has previously reported that the Fendouzhe submersible mission will conduct research on "deep-sea materials".Only a handful of people have ever visited the bottom of the Mariana Trench, which is a crescent-shaped depression in the Earth's crust that is deeper than Mount Everest is high.The first explorers visited the trench in 1960 on a brief expedition.But after that, there were no missions until Hollywood director James Cameron made the first solo trip to the bottom in 2012, describing a "desolate" and "alien" environment.The water pressure at the bottom of the trench is a crushing eight tons per square inch, more than a thousand times the atmospheric pressure at sea level.Discover stories of India’s leading eco-innovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksKamala HarrisBogota AirportUS Oil ReserveTrump TariffsUPI New RulesStarlink SatelliteJulia HymanTop TrendingTravis KelceTom BradyBengaluru Boy Kidnap MurderCBSE Class 10th Sample PapersHow new nep rule worksYuzvendra Chahal DatingStephen CurryJoe BurrowBlake LivelyTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteSSC exam 2025 glitches spark massive nationwide protest: Here’s why #SSCMisManagement is trending on social mediaCAT 2025 registration begins at iimcat.ac.in: Check direct link to apply online hereAP Police Constable final result 2025 released at slprb.ap.gov.in; check direct link hereIs Yuzvendra Chahal dating RJ Mahvash?

Mehar’s custom-engineered drone reached this remarkable milestone in an astonishing 0.91 seconds, a feat that not only demonstrates his technical prowess but also sets a new benchmark in the rapidly evolving world of drone technology.Mehar’s journey to this achievement has been anything but straightforward. His fascination with drones began in 8th grade, and this passion has only deepened over the years. With a keen interest in pushing technological boundaries, Mehar embarked on a months-long project to build a drone capable of unparalleled vertical acceleration.“I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of pushing the limits of what drones can do,” Mehar explained. “But breaking a world record wasn’t just about the end result; it was about the process. I wanted to prove that current technology could achieve something extraordinary, but the path to get there was filled with challenges.”The project required Mehar to design, test, and refine multiple drone prototypes. “There were moments when I felt like I was chasing an impossible dream,” Mehar recalled. “I went through countless designs, and many of them failed during testing. Some drones crashed so badly that I had no choice but to go back to the drawing board and start from scratch. Each crash was a setback, but it also sparked new ideas and innovations.”Undeterred by the setbacks, Mehar poured his energy into creating a drone that was not only fast but also aerodynamically optimized. “I spent countless hours on CAD software, meticulously designing and tweaking each component. The goal was to make the drone as streamlined as possible, which led me to shape it like a rocket. This design wasn’t just about aesthetics; it was about reducing drag and maximizing speed.”Mehar’s dedication to his craft paid off in spectacular fashion. “Every failure taught me something valuable,” he said. “It forced me to think creatively and to consider every detail, from the materials used to the weight distribution of the drone. The process was grueling, but it was also incredibly rewarding to see my ideas take flight—literally.”This record-breaking achievement is more than just a personal triumph for Mehar; it has significant implications for the future of drone technology. “The possibilities are endless,” Mehar mused. “High-speed vertical acceleration could revolutionize everything from emergency response to space exploration. This isn’t just about setting a record; it’s about opening doors to new innovations and applications.”Mehar’s groundbreaking work has already begun to inspire others in the drone community and beyond. “I hope this accomplishment encourages other young innovators to push their own boundaries,” he said. “Technology is advancing rapidly, and there’s so much potential waiting to be unlocked. I’m excited to see where we can go from here.”As Mehar looks ahead, the sky is truly the limit.

The formats mentioned above are most prominently used globally. JPGs can be different things like signatures required to sign documents or screenshots of an instruction manual. When converting JPG to PDF and then sharing it, you want to maintain the quality of the image. It also becomes highly convenient for the end-user to access the PDF file.There are a plethora of tools to convert JPG to PDF. Nonetheless, a tool that has gained a lot of trust in the segment is Adobe Acrobat. It simply converts any file from JPG to PDF without altering the quality. Moving ahead, we will step by step explain how you can use Adobe Acrobat to convert an image to PDF.Basic Definition of JPG and PDFJPG or JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, and it is mostly used for compressing highly detailed images, making them smaller for increasing their shareability.

Another highlight is that it also maintains the quality of images when the size (dimensions) is increased.Why should you convert JPG to PDF? Regarding size, JPG files take less space than PDFs. However, PDF files are easily manageable, and you can also use the other services in Adobe Document Cloud to make sharing, uploading, and managing super easy. PDF will have the upper hand over JPG because the former is easily editable. Any JPG converted to PDF can be divided into different components for editing.

Choose a plan - You can also opt for the free plan if you prefer. Apart from that, the subscription can be purchased at minimal prices. Tap on the plus button and the right bottom of the screen and then tap on the open file. Give the application storage access to get your files for editing. Select the file you want to convert. Now, you will see the 'Convert PDF' button under the image; tap on it. Your image will be successfully converted to PDF. Note: On the smartphone version, you cannot use the Image to PDF convert feature for free.Frequently asked questionsCan you convert JPG to PDF for free?Yes, there are multiple online and offline tools that can be used to convert any image to PDF without spending a single dime.How to convert JPG into editable PDF?There are not many tools available in the market that offer accurate PDF editing features such as Adobe Acrobat.

Doordarshan will telecast live the Mangala, Shringaar, Rajbhog, Sandhya, and Shayan Aartis offered to the Ram Lalla idol at the Ayodhya Ram temple on DD National, connecting devotees who can't visit the temple. National broadcaster Doordarshan has good news for Lord Ram Devotees. Doordarshan has announced that it will telecast live the morning prayers offered to the Ram Lalla idol at the Ram Temple in Ayodhya every day.Doordarshan has shared the same in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Doordarshan said that the morning aarti offered to Ram Lalla will be telecast live on DD National every morning from 6:30 am.The national broadcaster said that the decision to telecast the morning aarti live every day was taken with the aim of connecting devotees of Lord Ram, especially after the temple was inaugurated less than two months ago in a grand ceremony and everyone can't visit the temple in person. The Aarti will be telecast simultaneously on DD’s YouTube channel also.Secondly, the decision was taken because the Trust doesn’t have logistical arrangements as of now for a live broadcast. Therefore, DD will be posting a two-three-member crew on the temple premises for the coverage of the daily ritual.DD's announcement to telecast the Aarti live for 30 minutes every morning comes after getting the go-ahead from the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust for the same. Initially, DD will air the “Mangala aarti” for a few months, and then, the Ram Temple Trust will take a call on how to take it forward.6 Aartis daily at the Ayodhya Ram templeThere are 6 aartis of Ram Lalla held daily in Ayodhya Ram temple. These include Mangala Aarti at 4:30 am, Shringaar Aarti at 6:30 am, Rajbhog Aarti at 12 noon, Utthapan Aarti at 2 pm, Sandhya Aarti at 7 pm, and Shayan Aarti at 10 pm.Giving directions to devotees for Aarti, the temple trust said, "Entry for Mangala Aarti at 4 AM, Shringar Aarti at 6:15 AM, and Shayan Aarti at 10 PM is possible only with an entry pass. No entry passes required for other Aartis."Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust advisory to devoteesIn an advisory to devotees coming for darshan at the temple, the Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra said, "Devotees can enter the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir for Darshan from 6:30 AM to 9:30 PM. The entire process from entry to exit after Darshan at the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir is extremely simple and convenient. Typically, devotees can have a smooth Darshan of Prabhu Shri Ram Lalla Sarkar within 60 to 75 minutes."The temple trust advised devotees to leave their mobile phones, footwear, purses and other personal items outside the Mandir premises for their convenience and to save time.It has also asked devotees not to bring flowers, garlands, Prasad to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

The design aims to eliminate the hinge crease and reduce the device's thickness while offering added benefits and durability. However, its practicality remains uncertain. Microsoft discontinues Surface Duo smartphones but files a patent for a new foldable device with a single hinge system called 'spine cover plate'. The design aims to eliminate the hinge crease and reduce the device's thickness while offering added benefits and durability. However, its practicality remains uncertain. Microsoft did not get the success it was anticipating with its Android-powered Surface Duo-series smartphones. The company has discontinued the lineup after the Duo 2. But, this does not mean the company has stopped trying. A new patent application filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29, reveals that the company is working on another foldable or dual-display mobile device.The patent application describes the company’s take on the foldable smartphone concept with single hinge technology called “spine cover plate”.Next Microsoft smartphones could feature a Galaxy Z Fold-like designAccording to the patent application, the phone could feature a “flexible display” in a bookstyle design similar to Galaxy Z Fold decies. However, the entire focus is on the spine cover plate mechanism which is aimed at protecting the single-hinge system of the device by covering the structural element. The differentiating factor between the regular hinge and Microsoft’s design is that the spine cover adjusts automatically during the opening and closing of the phone to prevent any unnecessary gaps around the hinge to protect it from dust as well as water. Currently, Samsung’s design offers an IPX8 rating which makes their foldables water-resistant only.The patent further mentions that the new hinge mechanism could allow Microsoft to eliminate the hinge crease less visible than the current options available in the market. Moreover, Microsoft has also mentioned techniques that could allow them to reduce the overall thickness of the foldable smartphone by allowing the spine cover plate to move closer to the device’s hinge when folded. “By retracting the spine cover plate toward the central spine as the first display-supporting frame and the second display-supporting frame are rotated into a face-to-face orientation, the width of the folded computing device is reduced, thereby enabling easier and more comfortable handling of the device, such as with one hand,” Microsoft noted in the patent.Interesting idea, but practicality is a question markThe entire smartphone market is searching for a way to eliminate the foldable crease from their smartphones. Some brands have already implemented the water-drop folding mechanism to reduce it, but there’s nothing like a crease-free foldable out there. Apart from that, the durability quotient of foldable is also important considering all the movable parts these phones have. That said, adding another layer or a movable part on top of the entire foldable mechanism does not appear like a wise move despite the added benefits and durability Microsoft has explained in the patent application.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Initiatives include partnering with the Election Commission, prioritizing trusted content on YouTube, and implementing advertising policies for transparency. Measures against AI-generated content are also taken. Google has announced a series of initiatives aimed at supporting the democratic process and safeguarding its platforms from abuse during the upcoming Indian General Election. With millions of eligible voters heading to the polls, the tech giant has said that recognises its responsibility to connect users with reliable information and counter the spread of misinformation, including AI-generated content.Easy access to voting information on Search and YouTubeGoogle has mentioned that its primary focus is on providing easy access to authoritative information from trusted sources.The company has also partnered with the Election Commission of India to showcase critical details on Google Search and YouTube, such as how to register and vote, in English and Hindi. Apart from this, YouTube’s recommendation system will prioritise trusted content during the election season. Additionally, YouTube’s homepage will prominently showcase trusted content along with an “Up Next” panel to make election-related details easily available for users. YouTube will also highlight content from trusted sources during key moments through its Top News and Breaking News as well as a news watch page. Moreover, the tech giant has also set up information panels that indicate funding sources from publishers that receive public or government funding and information panels that provide topical context for topics prone to misinformation. Safeguarding misinformationTo protect the integrity of the electoral process and to protect its products and services from abuse, Google has re-inforced its existing policies to keep its products and platforms safe while curbing misinformation at the same time. Also, the policies apply to all users, irrespective of the content type. The company has employed a combination of human reviewers and artificial intelligence models to identify and remove content that violates these policies. Google's AI capabilities are enhancing its abuse-fighting efforts, enabling faster action against emerging threats.Advertising during election campaignsTo keep things transparent when it comes to election advertising, the company requires advertisers to undergo identity verification and provide necessary certifications from the Election Commission. Election ads must also include disclosures indicating the advertiser's identity and location. Google maintains a searchable hub for all election ads, providing insights into the advertisers and their spending.Restricting AI-generated contentGoogle has also taken some steps to help identify AI-generated content through new tools and policies. The company has introduced disclosure requirements for election ads containing synthetic content and will soon require creators on YouTube to label realistic altered or synthetic content. The new ad policies prohibit the use of manipulated media to mislead people, like deepfakes or doctored content.Google has also implemented restrictions to Gemini on the types of election-related queries it will respond to and has also prioritised the provision of high-quality information. Additional features, such as the "About this Image" tool in Search and digital watermarking for AI-generated images, aim to provide users with context and assess credibility.Furthermore, Google has joined the C2PA coalition, a cross-industry effort to provide transparency and context for AI-generated content. The company has confirmed the deployment of technology to counter harmful AI-generated content aimed at deceiving voters during the 2024 elections.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

TSMC's stock rallied, elevating its market capitalisation to a record, making it higher than Broadcom. Analysts expect TSMC to further advance amid surging AI-related revenue and strong pricing power.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has reclaimed a spot in the list of the world’s 10 most valuable companies, riding the optimism of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom in the tech industry that pushed its stock to record levels.According to a report by Bloomberg, TSMC’s stock rallied 14% last week, elevating the chipmaker’s market capitalisation to a record, before a 2% decline in early trading on Monday (March 11), pared it to $634 billion. However, the decline didn’t impact the company much as it still has a market share higher than that of Broadcom, the report noted.What analysts have to sayAnalysts from Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. expect the semiconductor giant – that has Apple, Nvidia and Qualcomm as its customers – to advance further amid surging AI-related revenue and strong pricing power. “Generative AI semi is an obvious growth driver for TSMC,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Charlie Chan wrote in a note last week. The company’s overseas expansion also helps mitigate geopolitical concerns, they said.TSMC’s revenue gained 9.4% in the first two months of 2024 as demand for high-end chips increased due to a wave of activity in AI.Nvidia gets ‘AI boost’This is not the first time this year that a chip company has seen its stock on an upward spiral. This year, Nvidia was among the companies that got a boost by a frenzy around generative AI.In the last month, Nvidia stock price has risen over 20% while in the last six months, it has risen over 90%. Moreover, in the last one year, Nvidia stock price has appreciated from $234.36 per share level to $875.28 per share mark – registering a 275% jump.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

The update combines gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer data, reducing magnetic interference and benefiting Google Maps and third-party apps on Android 5.0 or above. Google Maps is updating its Fused Orientation Provider (FOP) API to improve direction accuracy in busy areas. The update combines gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer data, reducing magnetic interference and benefiting Google Maps and third-party apps on Android 5.0 or above. We keep hearing about Google Maps fiasco from across the globe where it directed people in some odd direction and eventually got them stuck in a ‘worst case scenario’. Now a new post published on the Android Developers blog gives an insight about Maps getting a new update to better with directions. The post talks about a potential upgrade that Maps will be getting with the Fused Orientation Provider (FOP) API that aims to make the ‘orientation’ detection better on Android devices, irrespective of the hardware used by different OEMs on their devices. According to the post, the update will make Maps interpret the directions better to make it more accurate by combining the gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer data. However, this idea of Google using data from all the sensors isn’t new, the company has used the API before, but the update will make better magnetic interference. As per the post, the changes will not only apply to Google Maps but also third-party apps that rely on Google Maps to offer navigational data. It is to be noted that the update will be done with internals of the Google Maps, it won’t affect the user interface or the layout of the app. Also, the updated API will be rolled out from the server side or via the app update in Android devices running Android 5.0 or above. How it will affect usersAs mentioned, the update won’t change anything in terms of the app’s design or user interface. The changes are internal in the form of API which will be pushed automatically via the update. That said, the update is set to make it better with directions, especially in busy areas.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Musk announces xAI open sourcing Grok chatbot. OpenAI CEO Altman takes a dig at Musk's chatbot. Musk, obviously didn't like the jab and replied with a long-ish message saying “GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.”  Elon Musk has been extremely critical of ChatGPT maker OpenAI for deviating from its mission to develop AI for the benefit of humanity and taking a profit-making path. He has advocated that artificial intelligence (AI) should be accessible for all, and he has now announced that his AI startup xAI will open source Grok chatbot this week.“This week, @xAI will open source Grok,” Musk said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).In simpler words, open-sourcing a software, like a chatbot, means that the software projects are redistributable as all source code is accessible by everyone. One of the advantages of having open source software is that it provides flexibility to an enterprise to have multiple ways of fixing a problem rather than waiting for an internal team to provide a solution.“OpenAI is a lie”Meanwhile, a user suggested that OpenAI should do the same.“OpenAI should do the same if they are ‘open’ that is,” the user said. Musk replied, “OpenAI is a lie.”Musk wants AI technology to be open-source Musk had floated the idea of open-sourcing AI during a podcast in November last year. In a podcast with Lex Fridman, Musk suggested that he likes the idea of open-source AI. “I am generally in favour of open sourcing, like biassed towards open sourcing,” he said.His comments came soon after his AI company called xAI released Grok, its chatbot, which reportedly took four months to build. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was quick to take a dig at this and shared a post in which he built Grok with a single prompt on GPT Builder."GPTs can save a lot of effort:” he said.Musk, obviously didn't like the jab and replied with a long-ish message saying “GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.” About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Ruby Johnson filed a lawsuit against Detective Gary Staab and Sgt. Gregory Buschy.  Apple's Find My app has cost the city of Denver, US $3.76 million in compensation and damages. In 2022, the city’s police wrongly raided and ransacked an elderly woman's home looking for a stolen truck and guns. According to a report by CNN, Denver police were seeking to recover a stolen truck loaded with guns, ammo and cash. For this, the police used Apple's Find My technology on another iPhone to locate the vehicle.However, the police picked the wrong house out of a fairly wide area to storm in and catch the thieves. Due to this misplaced raid, 78-year-old Ruby Johnson filed a lawsuit against the police. As compensation, the city will be paying Johnson a $3.76 million award. Moreover, the defendant officers — Detective Gary Staab and Sgt. Gregory Buschy — were also sued as an individual. Denver police had previously cleared both men of wrongdoing, but the jury disagreed.How Apple’s Find My app played a roleThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) brought the case on behalf of Johnson. The lawsuit mentioned that the raid was conducted based on an “alleged location ping from an iPhone's Find My app that the officers did not understand and for which they had no training." As per the complaint, the police relied on a "Find My" ping from an iPhone 11 that was probably still in the stolen truck. However, the area identified included parts of six other properties across parts of four city blocks.In a statement, Johnson's attorney Tim Macdonald said: “We are disturbed by the lack of training or policy changes and hope that the amount of the punitive damages award will send a strong message that the police department must take seriously the constitutional rights of its residents.” The ACLU and the jury concluded that the two police officers who ordered the raid had no reason to single out Johnson's house as the target. Also, the officers have to pay nearly $1.25 million each in punitive and compensatory damages. A Denver District Court clerk noted that the city has not yet filed an appeal of the verdict.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

A bill to sell TikTok is introduced, backed by President Biden. Kotick discussed acquisition with OpenAI head. Activision Blizzard faced a lawsuit. Concerns about data privacy and ties to China persist. TikTok urges American users to support it.  Bobby Kotick, the former head of Activision Blizzard, is reportedly considering buying TikTok, as the app could be banned in the United States. The Wall Street Journal reports that Kotick has talked to ByteDance, the company that owns TikTok, about buying the app, which could cost hundreds of billions of dollars.This comes as US lawmakers introduce a new bill that would make ByteDance sell TikTok within six months or stop it from being available in US app stores.President Joe Biden has said he would approve the bill if it passes in Congress.The Wall Street Journal report adds that Kotick, the head of OpenAI, Sam Altman, discussed teaming up to buy TikTok at a dinner last week. Kotick's interest in TikTok follows a rough end to his 30 years leading Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft acquired last year. The company faced a lawsuit saying it allowed sexual harassment and discrimination under Kotick's leadership. The Wall Street Journal also said Kotick knew about bad behaviour and didn't tell the board everything. Kotick was accused of harassment, but Activision Blizzard said the report was "misleading."Lawmakers are worried about data privacy and TikTok's ties to China. US President Biden, whose administration has banned the app already on state devices, has expressed his support for banning the app in the US. However, former President Donald Trump, who once wanted to ban TikTok, has changed his mind, saying a ban would help TikTok's rivals, like Facebook and YouTube. As the bill against TikTok gains support, the app has asked its American users to speak up for it, sending messages telling users to call their representatives. The bill, which passed a committee last week, is expected to be approved when the House votes on Wednesday. If it passes, it will then go to the Senate, and then the bill will be signed by the President of the US.Former Activision boss reportedly wants to buy TikTokAbout the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Reason is said to be delay in the delivery of two supercomputers by the French company to Indian weather forecasting institutes. According to a report in news agency PTI, the Earth Sciences Ministry had ordered two supercomputers worth $100 million from French firm Eviden, of the Atos Group, last year to enhance the computing capabilities of its institutions -- the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM)."I am more upset because the target we set was December. The Union Cabinet had already approved purchasing the supercomputer. We have only four petaflop capacity. We want to install up to 18 petaflop capacity," Rijiju told PTI in a video interview.He said that the French company ran into some financial trouble and wanted the government to make payment to its subsidiary.Minister says that the delay is causing him "worry"Rijiju said that the delay has caused him lots of worry as the company has overshot the timeline. "But I think we will sort it out soon," he said, adding that the government wanted to be "very correct in our position legally"."We are ready to release the money because we want the machine immediately. The only problem is the amount is not small. So if we pay now, if the company is bankrupt or something happens, who will bail out," the minister said.Rijiju further added that the government was taking some steps to speed up the delivery of the supercomputer but did not elaborate. "But I hope the French government will also intervene because we have a good understanding and a very good relationship with the French government."Since it is a high-cost equipment, we want to ensure that the transaction happens duly and properly," he said."From outside, everything's ready. It is only the problem with the main company. They want us to pay their subsidiary. We will pay only to a company whom we have entered an MoU with," Rijiju said.The supercomputing system, based on Eviden's BullSequana XH2000, is said to have a combined power capacity of up to 21.3 petaflops.Supercomputer at IITMThe supercomputer at the Pune-based IITM will provide 13 petaflops of computing power for atmosphere and climate research. As per the PTI report, it will integrate 3,000 CPU nodes using AMD EPYC 7643 processors and 26 GPU nodes through NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. The system will benefit from the NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand networking platform with In-Network Computing, 3PB all flash and 29PB disk-based DDN EXAScaler ES400NVX2 storage and Micron high-technology memory.The existing computing facility at NCMRWF is 2.8 petaflops and at IITM is 4 petaflops, respectively.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

SC directs UP govt to regularise 6 daily-wage employees, slams decades of ‘exploitative ad-hocism’
The Supreme Court has ordered the Uttar Pradesh government to regularise six daily-wage Class-IV employees serving since the 1990s, slamming decades of “exploitative ad-hocism.” A Bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta held that financial constraints cannot justify denial of regularisation, directing creation of posts, arrears payment, recalculated pensions, and dues for retirees and deceased employees’ families.

New Delhi, India: The Supreme Court has ordered the Uttar Pradesh government to regularise six daily-wage Class-IV employees who had been serving in the state higher education services commission since the early 1990s.Coming down heavily on the state for decades of exploitative “ad-hocism,” a Bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta quashed a government order that had denied sanction for permanent posts citing financial hardships.The Bench held that the plea of financial constraints could not justify the prolonged denial of regularisation. “The State is not a mere market participant but a constitutional employer. It cannot balance budgets on the backs of those who perform the most basic and recurring public functions,” the court observed.Rejecting the state’s justification, the court said that a generic plea of “financial constraints,” ignoring functional necessity and decades of reliance on daily wagers to discharge regular duties, fell short of the reasonableness expected from a model public institution.It clarified that the present judgment does not contradict its earlier rulings against regularisation of irregular appointments, since the case involved the State’s arbitrary refusal to sanction posts despite its acknowledged need and long-standing dependence on the petitioners’ services.The apex court directed the Uttar Pradesh government and the U.P. Education Services Selection Commission to regularise the petitioners with effect from April 24, 2002, by creating supernumerary posts if necessary.It also ordered payment of arrears of pay and allowances, recalculated pensions for retirees, and settlement of terminal dues for the families of deceased employees.“The long-term extraction of regular labour under temporary labels corrodes confidence in public administration and offends the promise of equal protection,” the Bench observed.

7 ways students can retain more in less time: The case for ending cramming sessions
In 2025, cramming is losing relevance as research highlights smarter learning methods for lasting retention.

Techniques like spaced repetition, microlearning, active recall, and interleaving outperform last-minute study. Consistent habits, optimized environments, sleep, and nutrition further boost memory. By replacing cramming with evidence-based strategies, students can learn faster, retain more, and achieve long-term academic success.  In 2025, the academic landscape is evolving rapidly. With the proliferation of digital tools, changing attention spans, and an ever-growing volume of information, students face unprecedented challenges in retaining knowledge. Traditional cramming sessions, once deemed effective, are now under scrutiny. Emerging research and modern study techniques suggest that smarter, more deliberate approaches yield better long-term retention.Embrace spaced repetition Spaced repetition involves reviewing information at increasing intervals over time. This technique leverages the brain's natural memory processes, enhancing long-term retention. Tools like Quizlet have popularized this method, allowing students to efficiently review material. Studies confirm that spaced repetition significantly outperforms cramming in retaining.Incorporate microlearning Microlearning refers to consuming information in short, focused bursts. This approach aligns with the brain's capacity to process and retain small chunks of information. By dedicating just five minutes to a topic during daily routines, students can effectively reinforce learning without feeling overwhelmed.Utilize active recall Active recall involves actively retrieving information from memory rather than passively reviewing notes. Techniques like self-quizzing and teaching others are effective methods of active recall. This practice strengthens neural connections, making information more accessible in the future.Engage in interleaved practice Interleaving involves mixing different topics or subjects during study sessions. This approach contrasts with the traditional method of focusing on one topic at a time. Interleaving enhances problem-solving skills and helps students apply knowledge more flexibly. Maintain consistent study habits Establishing a regular study schedule is crucial. Consistency helps reinforce learning and prevents the need for last-minute cramming. Techniques like the Pomodoro method, which involves studying for 25 minutes followed by a 5-minute break, can enhance focus and productivity. Optimize the study environment A conducive study environment minimizes distractions and enhances concentration. Students should aim for a quiet, well-lit space and consider using tools like website blockers to maintain focus. Additionally, incorporating physical activity, such as short walks, can boost cognitive function and memory retention.Prioritize sleep and nutrition Adequate sleep and proper nutrition are foundational to cognitive function. Sleep consolidates memories, and a balanced diet provides the necessary nutrients for brain health. Students should aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night and maintain a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and omega-3 fatty acids.The downside of cramming Cramming may offer short-term benefits, but it often leads to superficial understanding and rapid forgetting. Research indicates that information learned through cramming is less likely to be retained long-term compared to information learned through spaced repetition and active engagement.  In the fast-paced academic environment of 2025, students must adapt to more effective study strategies. By embracing techniques like spaced repetition, microlearning, and active recall, students can enhance retention and comprehension. Moving away from traditional cramming sessions in favor of these evidence-based methods will lead to more meaningful and lasting learning experiences.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

These modules detail the mission launched in response to the Pahalgam terror attack, showcasing India's military capabilities and the unity displayed across the nation. It highlights technological advancements and diplomatic achievements, emphasizing the importance of standing against terrorism. File photo The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has launched two specially designed modules on Operation Sindoor for students of classes 3 to 12, aiming to bring lessons of courage, strategy, and national pride straight into the classroom. Far more than a military story, these modules frame Operation Sindoor as a promise to protect peace and honour the lives lost during the Pahalgam terror attack, as reported by PTI.According to ANI, the modules are being introduced as supplementary curriculum material, featuring maps of precision strikes, images of downed Pakistani drones, and Made-in-India defence systems. Written in a conversational style between teachers and students, they make complex military events accessible and engaging for young learnersI.Modules tailored for different stagesThe modules designed by NCERT are as follows:Classes 3 to 8: “Operation Sindoor — A Saga of Valour” focuses on courage, empathy, and the human side of the mission.Classes 9 to 12: “Operation Sindoor — A Mission of Honour and Bravery” provides a deeper look at strategic objectives, technological advances, and India’s military prowess.According to PTI, the modules explain that although Pakistan denied involvement in the Pahalgam attack, it was carried out on “direct orders by Pakistan’s military and political leadership.” On April 22, 2025, terrorists from The Resistance Front (TRF), a known proxy of Lashkar-e-Taiba, opened fire on tourists in Baisaran Valley, killing 26 people, including a Nepali citizen.Lessons from the pastStudents are introduced to earlier events to provide context:The Pulwama attack in February 2019, which killed 40 CRPF personnel.The Balakot airstrikes later that month, in which Mirage 2000 jets destroyed a Jaish-e-Mohammed training camp.The abrogation of Article 370, which brought peace, infrastructure development, improved schools, and increased tourism to Jammu and Kashmir. ANI notes that Pakistan was reportedly unsettled by these changes.Operation Sindoor: A precise and coordinated missionLaunched on May 7, 2025, at 1:05 am, Operation Sindoor targeted nine terror bases in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, including the key hubs of Muridke and Bahawalpur. In just 22 minutes, the Indian Army and Air Force neutralized the camps using Rafale and Su-30MKI jets, BrahMos missiles, drones, and ISRO satellite surveillance, PTI reports.Despite Pakistan’s retaliatory attempts using drones, artillery, and missiles, India’s multi-layered air defence system, including S-400 and Akash, prevented any damage to critical assets or civilian areas. The Navy asserted maritime dominance in the Arabian Sea, and the Border Security Force successfully foiled infiltration attempts.National unity and solidarityThe modules emphasise how India stood together in the wake of the attack. Candlelight marches were held nationwide, Muslim communities in Hyderabad, Lucknow, and Bhopal wore black armbands in protest, and border villages demanded strong action in support of the Armed Forces. In Kashmir, shopkeepers closed their shops to protest, and local communities actively denounced terrorism, breaking stereotypes and highlighting the voice of peace-loving citizens.The operation’s name, Sindoor, was chosen to honour the widows of the victims, symbolizing empathy, solidarity, and respect. Prime Minister Modi described it as a tribute that underscores both national courage and personal compassion.Technology, diplomacy, and national prideThe modules spotlight India’s technological self-reliance, showcasing indigenous jets, missiles, drones, and satellites. These modules also highlight how the operation demonstrated the effectiveness of the Make in India defence push, combining innovation with precision. Diplomatically, the modules also note that India successfully persuaded the US to officially declare TRF a foreign terrorist organisation in July 2025, PTI reports.Summing up, NCERT describes Operation Sindoor as “a military success, a technological breakthrough, and a political message all rolled into one—a triumph of bravery, strategy, and innovation,” as reported by ANI. By bringing this story into classrooms, NCERT hopes to inspire students with lessons of courage, unity, and patriotism, while also raising awareness about India’s defence capabilities and the importance of standing up against terrorism.Ready to navigate global policies?

Himachal Pradesh HC restores teacher’s curtailed maternity leave, terms salary recovery ‘impermissible’
The Himachal Pradesh High Court has quashed state orders curtailing a teacher’s maternity leave and initiating salary recovery. Justice Sandeep Sharma held that Kamini Sharma, a JBT, was entitled to her full 180-day leave sanctioned in 2021 despite her regularisation. The Court termed the recovery “wholly impermissible” and directed the government to release pending benefits within four weeks.

Justice Sandeep Sharma held that Kamini Sharma, a JBT, was entitled to her full 180-day leave sanctioned in 2021 despite her regularisation. The Court termed the recovery “wholly impermissible” and directed the government to release pending benefits within four weeks.  Shimla, Himachal Pradesh, India: The Himachal Pradesh High Court has come to the aid of a government school teacher whose maternity leave was curtailed midway after her regularisation, ruling that the state could not deny her the full benefit of leave already sanctioned.Justice Sandeep Sharma, in a detailed judgment delivered on August 11, 2025, allowed the petition filed by Kamini Sharma, a Junior Basic Teacher (JBT), and quashed the government’s orders dated December 13, 2021, December 23, 2021, and June 19, 2025.The Court noted that Sharma, who had given birth on August 21, 2021, was granted 180 days of maternity leave. However, after her services were regularised on October 21, 2021, she was compelled to rejoin duty the very next day by furnishing a medical fitness certificate.Subsequently, the education department cancelled her sanctioned leave, treated her absence as “extraordinary leave,” and even initiated recovery of salary.“The submission of Medical Fitness Certificate at the time of regularisation, in peculiar facts and circumstances as detailed hereinabove, could not have given any right to the respondents to curtail the maternity leave of the petitioner granted to her w.e.f. 21.8.2021, for a period of 180 days,” Justice Sharma observed.The judge also criticised the state’s conduct in proceeding with recovery despite an interim stay granted by the High Court on January 13, 2022. “Despite the said order, respondents have proceeded to order recovery from the petitioner vide order dated 19.6.2025, which is wholly impermissible,” the ruling said.Holding that the petitioner was entitled to complete her maternity leave until February 2022, the Court directed the government to release all due benefits within four weeks, failing which interest at 6% per annum would be payable from the date the amount fell due.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has dismissed as fake a message circulating on social media claiming that schools and colleges in the city and suburbs would remain closed on Wednesday, August 20, due to a 'red' alert for heavy rainfall.In an official statement shared on X, the civic body said, “This message is fake. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has not issued any such information through its official social media platforms.”Fake closure notice goes viralThe BMC also released an image of the forged message, which had been designed to look like an announcement from its verified handle and was widely shared on WhatsApp groups and other social media platforms. The fake post stated that all government, private, and municipal schools and colleges in Mumbai would be shut on August 20.Orange alert for Mumbai, red alert for RaigadAccording to the civic body, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an orange alert for Mumbai, predicting heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated locations across the city, Thane, and Palghar on August 20.A red alert, however, has been issued for neighbouring Raigad district, where heavy to very heavy showers are expected at some places.The BMC urged citizens not to believe in unverified messages and to rely only on its official communication channels for updates.(with PTI inputs) TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

Situated in the heart of New York City, Columbia offers one of the most sought-after Economics programs in the Ivy League. But behind the prestige comes a steep price tag. For the 2025 academic year, tuition, fees, and living expenses combine to make it one of the most expensive education investments globally.The undergraduate costAn undergraduate degree in Economics at Columbia comes with an annual tuition and fee structure ranging from $68,000 to $71,170. On top of this, students spend about $17,000 to $18,680 on housing and meals. Columbia also requires all students to purchase health insurance, priced at around $4,955 annually. Books and personal expenses add another $4,000.Taken together, the total cost for one year of undergraduate study lies between $90,000 and $95,000. Over a standard four-year program, this can amount to nearly $380,000, not including the yearly increments that universities typically introduce.Cost of master’s in economicsFor students pursuing a master’s in Economics, the financial demands remain equally high. Tuition alone is pegged at $67,320 for the year. Living in New York City—whether on or off campus—adds close to $21,897. Mandatory health insurance contributes $4,955, while books and supplies bring in an additional $1,250.That brings the total annual cost to approximately $95,422. With most MA programs running for two years, graduates can expect to spend close to $190,000 in total.The hidden expensesThe official numbers only tell part of the story. Costs at Columbia rise incrementally every year, meaning students should be prepared for annual hikes in both tuition and housing. For international students, the financial burden is heavier still, with visa fees, airfare, and potential insurance top-ups adding to the overall bill. Living in New York City can also be more expensive than the university’s estimates, particularly for those opting for off-campus housing.Can students get financial aid?Columbia’s undergraduate students benefit from need-based financial aid, and the university is known to meet 100 percent of demonstrated financial need for admitted students. For graduate students, the options are fewer but include competitive fellowships, teaching assistantships, and research assistantships. While these can ease the financial load, they are not guaranteed, especially for international applicants.Why students still choose ColumbiaDespite the daunting costs, Columbia University continues to draw students from across the world. Its Economics program is consistently ranked among the best, with faculty expertise spanning everything from global finance to development economics. Its location in New York offers unparalleled access to Wall Street, multinational firms, the United Nations, and leading policy think tanks—making it a unique launchpad for careers in economics, finance, and policymaking.The takeawayStudying Economics at Columbia University in 2025 is a six-figure annual investment, with undergraduates paying up to $95,000 per year and graduate students spending around $95,422. For many, this investment is justified by Columbia’s academic reputation, global networking opportunities, and the career pathways it opens. For aspiring economists, the challenge is not only gaining admission but also ensuring they can meet the significant financial commitment.Ready to navigate global policies?

Skipping grades, graduating college at 14, and interning at Intel and Blackbird.AI, Quazi’s journey blends academic brilliance with industry impact. His move underscores Wall Street’s growing competition with AI labs and tech giants for top talent.  Elon Musk’s youngest hire, Kairan Quazi, is trading rockets for trading algorithms. At just 16, the Bangladeshi-American prodigy has left SpaceX’s Starlink division after two years to join Citadel Securities in New York City as a developer. The move marks his entry into one of Wall Street’s most competitive arenas, where engineering talent is increasingly being courted by finance giants vying with AI labs and Big Tech for the brightest minds.“I felt ready to take on new challenges and expand my skill set into a different high-performance environment,” Quazi told Business Insider in an exclusive interview.But how did a teenager manage to leap from middle school to Wall Street in less than a decade?A childhood marked by accelerationQuazi’s journey has been anything but conventional. Skipping from third grade directly to college at age nine, he enrolled at Las Positas College, where he graduated with highest honors in mathematics at just 11. By 14, he had already become the youngest graduate in Santa Clara University’s 170-year history, completing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering cum laude, alongside graduate-level coursework in advanced algorithms, NLP, and data mining.During his undergraduate years, he combined academic rigor with teaching responsibilities, serving as a college tutor in calculus, statistics, and chemistry — an unusual role reversal for someone barely in his teens.From research labs to rocket scienceEven before completing his degree, Quazi built an impressive portfolio of research and industry experience. At age 10, he became the first undergraduate intern at Intel Labs’ Human AI group, working on predictive speech generation platforms — a stint that stretched over three and a half years. He also delivered keynote addresses at the Linux Foundation North America Summit and SHIFT AI Global Conference.In 2022, he joined the cyber-intelligence startup Blackbird.AI as a machine learning intern, developing pipelines to detect disinformation threats across social media. But it was his leap to SpaceX in 2023 that placed him on a global stage.As a software engineer at Starlink, Quazi worked on network beam planning and optimization, designing production-critical systems that determine how satellites target internet beams worldwide. “It required a deep understanding of low-latency, high-performance computing and real-time programming,” his LinkedIn profile notes.Why Wall Street over AI labsGiven his track record, Quazi had no shortage of offers from leading AI labs and technology firms. But he chose Citadel Securities for its blend of intellectual complexity and speed. “Quant finance offers a pretty rare combination: the complexity and intellectual challenge that AI research also provides, but with a much faster pace,” he explained to Business Insider. “At Citadel Securities, I’ll be able to see measurable impact in days, not months or years.”The firm’s meritocratic approach also appealed to him. Unlike many institutions that might hesitate at his age, Citadel evaluated him solely on skill.Life beyond algorithmsMoving to Manhattan represents more than just a career pivot. For the first time, Quazi will live independently, walking to work instead of relying on his mother to drive him to SpaceX’s Redmond office — a reminder that despite his resume, he is still a teenager navigating milestones most reach much later.Lessons from Quazi’s pathFor students and educators, Quazi’s story is not just one of precocity but of possibility. His journey highlights how alternative educational pathways — early college, project-based learning, and industry immersion — can cultivate talent far earlier than traditional timelines allow.As Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and AI labs compete for minds like his, the deeper lesson is clear: The future belongs to those willing to blur the boundaries between age, discipline, and convention.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

The survey highlights anxieties about AI's impact beyond employment. People are worried about political stability and military risks. There are concerns about energy consumption and human relationships. Education is a key battleground in the AI debate. Gen Z faces an uncertain job market.  The American workforce may be staring at its biggest disruption since the Industrial Revolution. A new Reuters/Ipsos poll has revealed that 71% of Americans believe artificial intelligence (AI) will cause “too many people to be permanently unemployed,” fueling fears that the technology could erase jobs faster than it creates them.The poll, conducted over six days and released on August 19, 2025, surveyed 4,446 adults and carries a margin of error of two percentage points. Its findings show widespread concern that AI is not merely another workplace tool but a force that could fundamentally reshape careers, industries, and even the social fabric of the country.For Gen Z—students and young professionals entering the job market—the implications are stark. They may be stepping into the most uncertain employment landscape in decades.Low unemployment, high anxietyOfficial numbers suggest stability. The US unemployment rate was 4.2% in July, a relatively low figure by historical standards. Yet the Reuters/Ipsos poll shows a growing perception gap: even as jobs exist today, Americans fear the long-term erosion of work opportunities due to AI.Unlike earlier waves of automation that primarily affected manufacturing and manual labor, AI threatens knowledge work—jobs in law, journalism, customer service, finance, and even medicine. These are the careers many Gen Z students are currently training for.“People are not just worried about layoffs,” Reuters reported. “They are worried that the work itself could vanish.”Democracy, security, and the human costThe survey also revealed anxieties that stretch far beyond the job market:Political Stability: 77% of Americans are worried about AI destabilising politics. One flashpoint was an AI-generated video showing former President Barack Obama being “arrested” by Donald Trump. Though fake, the clip spread widely online, underscoring the potential of AI to blur the line between truth and manipulation in an election year.Military Risks: Nearly half of respondents (48%) oppose the use of AI to determine military targets. Only 24% supported such deployment, reflecting discomfort with machines making life-and-death decisions.Energy Demands: 61% expressed concern over the energy consumption of AI systems, which require vast computing power and could exacerbate climate challenges.Human Relationships: Two-thirds of Americans worry people might begin to prioritize AI “companions” over real human connections. With AI chatbots and virtual partners already on the market, this fear no longer belongs solely to the realm of science fiction.These concerns highlight AI’s disruptive potential not just as an economic force but as a societal disruptor.Education in the crosshairsEducation is emerging as a key battleground in the AI debate. According to the Reuters/Ipsos poll:40% believe AI will harm learning outcomes,36% think it will improve education, and24% remain undecided.This split mirrors the uncertainty faced by students who wonder if their degrees will still hold value in a job market reshaped by algorithms. Gen Z graduates, many of whom already juggle student debt, are asking whether they are preparing for roles that could soon be automated out of existence.The Gen Z dilemmaFor Gen Z, the AI question is not abstract—it’s deeply personal. This generation is already grappling with rising housing costs, inflation, and gig-based employment structures. Now, they must also consider whether AI will undercut their chances at stable, long-term careers.Some experts argue that history offers hope. Just as the internet revolution created industries that were unimaginable in the 1990s, AI could give rise to new roles—from AI ethics officers to digital trust managers and climate-tech innovators.But as the Reuters report makes clear, most Americans aren’t convinced that new opportunities will outweigh the losses. The specter of permanent unemployment looms larger than the promise of new industries.The road aheadWhat does this mean for policymakers, educators, and employers? The Reuters/Ipsos poll suggests three urgent takeaways:Job Security Must Be Redefined: Traditional “safe” careers may no longer be immune to disruption, and governments will need to rethink retraining programs and social safety nets.Education Needs a Reset: Universities and schools must adapt curricula to emphasize creativity, critical thinking, and adaptability—skills less likely to be replaced by machines.Trust and Ethics Matter: With public fears extending to democracy, relationships, and even warfare, responsible AI development is no longer optional—it’s essential.Ready to navigate global policies?

Their diverse academic backgrounds, primarily in fields like medicine, law, engineering, and business from elite universities, have paved the way for shaping US domestic and foreign policy.  From the Vice President’s office in Washington to the House of Representatives across multiple states, Indian-origin leaders are making history in the United States. As of 2025, at least eight Indian-Americans hold influential positions in US politics, bringing with them diverse professional expertise, cultural identity, and a strong grounding in education.Their academic backgrounds span medicine, law, engineering, economics, and business—fields that continue to resonate with Indian families worldwide. For these politicians, universities were not just stepping stones but launchpads for careers that now shape US domestic and foreign policy.Kamala HarrisThe daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, Kamala Harris made history as America’s first woman and first Indian-origin Vice President. Harris studied economics and political science at Howard University, one of the most prestigious historically Black colleges, before earning her law degree at UC Hastings College of Law. Her legal training laid the foundation for her career as California’s Attorney General and later as US Senator, before rising to the nation’s second-highest office.Ami BeraA practicing physician before entering politics, Dr. Ami Bera represents California’s 6th District. He completed his BS in Biological Sciences and MD at UC Irvine, later serving as a clinical professor of medicine. His medical expertise has often informed his policy positions on healthcare, science, and technology, making him a leading voice in Congress on public health issues.Raja KrishnamoorthiBorn in India and raised in Illinois, Raja Krishnamoorthi embodies academic excellence. He graduated summa cum laude in Mechanical Engineering from Princeton University, followed by a JD from Harvard Law School. His dual background in STEM and law positioned him as a policy leader in technology, workforce development, and national security.Ro KhannaRo Khanna, representing California’s tech heartland, is known as one of the most progressive voices in US politics. After earning a BA in Economics from the University of Chicago, Khanna studied law at Yale Law School. His educational training in economics and law mirrors his political platform, where he champions innovation, workers’ rights, and digital equity.Pramila JayapalSeattle-based Pramila Jayapal, the first Indian-American woman elected to the US House, brings a global perspective. She studied English Literature and Economics at Georgetown University before earning an MBA from Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. Her mix of humanities and business education prepared her for a career in advocacy, grassroots organising, and eventually leadership in the Congressional Progressive Caucus.Shri ThanedarDetroit Congressman Shri Thanedar has perhaps the most unconventional educational journey. Starting with a BS in Chemistry at Karnatak University and an MS at the University of Mumbai, he went on to pursue a PhD in Chemistry at the University of Akron. Thanedar later became a successful entrepreneur before entering politics, showing how scientific training can translate into business and public service.Suhas SubramanyamAt 39, Suhas Subramanyam represents a younger generation of Indian-American politicians. A Philosophy major at Tulane University, he went on to study law at Northwestern University’s Pritzker School of Law. His blend of liberal arts and law reflects his interest in ethical governance, technology policy, and civil rights.Vivek RamaswamyEntrepreneur-turned-politician Vivek Ramaswamy rose to prominence as a presidential candidate and now serves in the Trump administration. A Biology graduate from Harvard with a JD from Yale Law School, Ramaswamy’s educational trajectory mirrors his professional duality, leading billion-dollar biotech firms before entering America’s political spotlight.The bottom lineDespite differences in ideology and career paths, education emerges as the binding force among these leaders. Elite US universities like Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Northwestern, and UC campuses dominate their resumes, underscoring the role of higher education in shaping political leadership.Ready to navigate global policies?

Why parents are losing faith in US public schools even as most oppose shutting down the Education Department
Public confidence in U.S. schools is falling as parents turn towards private and alternative education models, fueled by declining enrollment, school choice expansion, and pandemic-era shifts. Yet, most Americans oppose shutting down the Education Department, highlighting a paradox: Families want more options but still value public education. Consolidations, closures, and redesigns loom as districts face mounting pressure.

Yet, most Americans oppose shutting down the Education Department, highlighting a paradox: Families want more options but still value public education. Consolidations, closures, and redesigns loom as districts face mounting pressure.  Public opinion on U.S. schools is undergoing a noticeable shift. Rising school choice options, shrinking enrollment pools, and pandemic-era pivots toward alternative models have left many parents questioning the future of public education.According to the 57th annual PDK Poll released Tuesday, nearly 60% of parents now say they support using public funds for their child to attend a private or religious school — up from 50% in 2007. At the same time, confidence in public schools has fallen sharply, with only 43% of respondents grading their community schools an A or B in 2025, compared to 53% in 2013.Yet despite waning support for the public school system, a majority of Americans remain resistant to dismantling it altogether. The poll found that 66% oppose or strongly oppose closing the U.S. Department of Education, a long-standing goal of the Trump administration. Just 22% backed its closure.Expanding school choice, shrinking enrollmentThe growing preference for alternatives to public education comes as school districts confront declining birth rates, shrinking enrollment pools, and expanded competition from private and choice-based models.Congress in July approved the first federal private school choice tax credit under President Donald Trump’s “Big, Beautiful” budget law, a move that could make private schooling options more accessible nationwide. According to K-12 DIVE, Researchers also point to the COVID-19 pandemic as a turning point, with many parents turning to homeschooling, micro-schools, or alternative education models — a shift that shows signs of persisting even if its momentum has slowed.Enrollment declines are already forcing difficult decisions. The Austin Independent School District in Texas is weighing school consolidations after losing over 10,000 students in the past decade, with potential closures as early as the 2026–27 academic year. Atlanta Public Schools has also begun studying consolidation and merger plans, while in July, St. Louis Public Schools proposed shuttering 37 of its 68 schools over the next two years, according to K-12 DIVE.What else the poll revealsBeyond attitudes towards funding and enrollment, the PDK Poll highlighted other trends shaping education debates:AI in classrooms: 68% of respondents opposed providing student data to artificial intelligence software for grading or assessment. Public support for AI tools in lesson planning and teaching fell between 2024 and 2025.Diversity initiatives: 61% of adults said diversity, inclusion, and equity efforts are very or somewhat important in schools.Cellphones in class: A striking 86% favored some form of cellphone restriction during the school day.Teacher pay: While still high, concern about low teacher salaries dipped slightly — 64% of respondents in 2025 said pay is too low, down from 66% in 2018.A system under pressureThe findings underscore the paradox facing U.S. education: While parents increasingly explore private or alternative schooling options, they are not ready to abandon public education as an institution. Two-thirds of Americans believe closing the Education Department would harm public schooling, according to the poll.But as demographic shifts reduce student populations and alternative models gain ground, districts across the country face a stark reality — one where consolidations, closures, or redesigns may become the new normal.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

They are engaged in legal battles across several states. Wyoming and Utah saw judges halt voucher programs due to constitutional concerns. Similar lawsuits are progressing in Montana and Missouri. The South Carolina Supreme Court initially ruled against a voucher program. The fight highlights the debate over public versus private education.  Teachers unions across the United States are waging a series of high-stakes legal fights against private school voucher programs, and in some states, they’re winning. At least five lawsuits have been filed since 2022, when the US Supreme Court’s Carson v. Makin ruling allowed public funding to flow to private, including religious, schools.According to The 74, the challenges led primarily by teachers unions in Wyoming, Utah, Montana, Missouri, and South Carolina, have already produced two significant victories. Judges in both Wyoming and Utah have halted voucher programs, citing constitutional concerns.Judges side with educators in Wyoming and UtahIn July, the Wyoming Education Association secured an injunction blocking the state’s newly expanded universal voucher plan. District Court Judge Peter Froelicher ruled that the $30 million Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act, which offers families $7,000 in state-funded scholarships, cannot proceed until its constitutionality is decided.Union president Kim Ame told The 74 that lawmakers went too far by removing income caps: “Our constitution clearly says that we cannot give public money to private entities, so that’s why we challenged that.” The state has appealed to the Wyoming Supreme Court.Utah saw a similar outcome earlier this year, when a judge struck down the $100 million Utah Fits All Scholarship Program. The Utah Education Association argued that the initiative diverted taxpayer dollars to private schools not required to admit all students or operate under state supervision. The case is now headed to the Utah Supreme Court.More lawsuits move through the courtsUnions in other states are pursuing parallel claims. In Montana, the state’s largest public employees union joined litigation targeting a voucher program for students with disabilities, arguing in a legal brief that such initiatives strip children of essential protections guaranteed in public schools.Missouri’s MOScholars program has also come under fire. Initially launched as a tax-credit scholarship in 2021, it was expanded this year with $50 million in direct taxpayer funding. The Missouri National Education Association sued in June, alleging that lawmakers “constructed out of whole cloth a scheme to divert general revenues” to private tuition. Pro-school choice groups, including EdChoice Legal Advocates, have since intervened in defense of the program.In South Carolina, the state Supreme Court ruled in 2024 that its Education Trust Fund Scholarship Program was unconstitutional. Lawmakers have since revived it by diverting funds from the state lottery rather than the general budget, a workaround noted by The 74.A growing national showdownThe push-and-pull reflects a broader struggle over the future of American education. As The 74 has reported, more than 30 states now operate some form of private school choice. Advocates say vouchers give families critical flexibility; unions counter that they weaken public schools and run afoul of constitutional provisions requiring a uniform system of education.With appeals pending in Utah and Wyoming, and new cases advancing in Montana and Missouri, 2025 is shaping up to be a decisive year. The outcomes could determine not just the legality of state voucher programs, but the balance of power between public school systems and school choice advocates nationwide.Ready to navigate global policies?

Why Linda McMahon wants Oklahoma to move away from federal testing rules
U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon visited Oklahoma to promote shifting control of schools from Washington to states, signaling support for replacing federal standardized testing with local assessments. Touring Dove Science Academy and joining Gov. Kevin Stitt, she framed deregulation as key to Trump’s agenda.

Touring Dove Science Academy and joining Gov. Kevin Stitt, she framed deregulation as key to Trump’s agenda. Supporters see flexibility; critics warn it risks widening inequities and weakening accountability.  U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon’s visit to Oklahoma on Tuesday offered a glimpse into how the Trump administration plans to rewire America’s public school system: By dismantling federal oversight and returning control to the states.At the heart of the conversation was a proposal to replace statewide standardized testing with locally chosen assessments, a plan advanced by Oklahoma Superintendent Ryan Walters. While McMahon acknowledged the idea had “not gone through all the different steps” for approval, she signaled openness to rethinking the decades-old system that ties federal funding to uniform student exams.“We want to give them the most flexibility that we can give them to operate within their state,” McMahon said while speaking with reporters at the state Capitol.A tour with political undertonesMcMahon’s schedule underscored the political theater surrounding education policy. She appeared alongside Gov. Kevin Stitt and former House Speaker Charles McCall, now running for governor, but not with Walters — despite his vocal support for the Trump administration. The absence reflected a deepening rift between Oklahoma’s top education officials, who have sparred publicly for months.Her tour of Dove Science Academy, a high-performing charter school in Warr Acres, doubled as a showcase for the administration’s vision. Students flew drones, coded robots, and even programmed a robot dog to shake McMahon’s hand. That same day, U.S. News & World Report ranked the academy as the third-best high school in Oklahoma.Later, she joined Stitt at the Capitol as he signed a bill banning diversity, equity, and inclusion programs from higher education institutions — a priority that mirrors the Trump administration’s broader agenda.Cutting Washington down to sizeMcMahon’s trip is part of her 50-state “Returning Education to the States Tour,” a campaign launched after the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for mass downsizing at the Department of Education. President Trump has tasked McMahon with nothing less than dismantling the agency itself.The administration’s proposal envisions funneling federal dollars into large block grants, giving states discretion over spending. In theory, it would free schools from the maze of compliance paperwork that governors like Stitt argue drains resources. But any major restructuring would require congressional approval, where questions of accountability and equity loom large.Oklahoma’s paradoxStitt pointed to his state’s recent moves to expand charter funding, offer tax credits for private-school families, and boost overall education spending as evidence of progress. Yet national assessments still rank Oklahoma near the bottom in student outcomes, exposing the tension between expanding choice and improving academic performance.McMahon avoided commenting directly on whether she trusts Walters’s leadership, even as his department faces persistent turmoil. Instead, she emphasized flexibility and deregulation as the north stars of federal policy.The bigger pictureThe debate in Oklahoma captures a larger national moment: the push to redefine what role, if any, Washington should play in American classrooms. By sidelining standardized tests and federal regulations, the Trump administration is seeking to place the burden, and opportunity, squarely on states.For supporters, it is a long-overdue chance to strip away bureaucracy and focus on students. For critics, it risks deepening inequalities between districts and undermining efforts to measure progress on a common scale.What is clear is that McMahon’s tour is not just symbolic. It is a preview of the classroom battles ahead, where the fight is less about robots and rankings and more about who gets to decide what education looks like in the 21st century.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

Federal judge blocks Mississippi’s ban on ‘divisive concepts’ in classrooms, fuelling national fight over DEI and academic freedom
A federal judge has blocked key parts of Mississippi's new law restricting DEI practices in public schools, citing First Amendment concerns. The injunction halts enforcement of sections banning 'divisive concepts' related to race, sex, and gender identity. While some provisions remain, the ruling allows educators to continue discussing contested issues, potentially influencing similar legal challenges nationwide.

A federal judge has blocked major portions of Mississippi’s new law restricting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices in public schools, issuing a ruling that sharply questioned the statute’s constitutionality.US District Judge Henry Wingate granted a preliminary injunction on Monday, pausing enforcement of sections that ban schools from teaching so-called “divisive concepts” related to race, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or national origin. His order also blocks restrictions on DEI programs, courses, offices, and required diversity training, according to the Associated Press.Law still partially in effectThe injunction does not block other provisions of the law, including those prohibiting preferential treatment based on race, sex, or national origin and provisions penalising schools if staff or students refuse to adopt DEI concepts. The law, which took effect in April, threatens schools with the loss of state funding if they are found in violation.Court cites first amendment concernsIn his ruling, Wingate said the law “is unconstitutionally vague, fails to treat speech in a viewpoint-neutral manner, and carries with it serious risks of terrible consequences with respect to the chilling of expression and academic freedom,” according to the Associated Press.He also allowed the plaintiffs to add class-action claims, ensuring the injunction protects all teachers, professors, and students in the state.Teachers warn of chilling effectAt a hearing in early August, educators testified about the risks of teaching under the new law. Cliff Johnson, a professor at the University of Mississippi Law School, told the court that lessons on the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the Civil Rights Act, or even the murders of Emmett Till and Martin Luther King Jr. could be deemed impermissible.“I can teach my class as usual and run the serious risk of being disciplined, or I could abandon something that’s very important to me,” Johnson said, according to the Associated Press. “I feel a bit paralyzed.”State defends lawAttorneys for the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office argued the measure is consistent with government authority over school curriculum.“They are speaking for the government and the government has every right to tell them what they need to say on its behalf,” Assistant Attorney General Lisa Reppeto said, as reported by the Associated Press. She added that the statute’s penalties apply to schools, not to individual teachers or students.National implicationsThe Mississippi case is part of a broader wave of state efforts to limit how schools address race, gender, and sexuality. Legal experts say Wingate’s injunction could serve as a reference point for challenges to similar laws in other states.For now, the ruling allows Mississippi educators to continue discussing contested issues while the lawsuit proceeds — but the larger fight over DEI in schools is likely to intensify nationwide.Ready to navigate global policies?

Prabhas has solidified his position as the 'Day 1 King' in Indian cinema, consistently delivering massive opening day numbers with films like *Saaho*, *Adipurush*, *Salaar*, and *Kalki 2898 AD*, even when reviews are mixed. His pan-Indian appeal and event-style projects set him apart, establishing a new benchmark for box office success that other South Indian superstars are striving to achieve. In the ever-evolving landscape of Indian cinema, where the box office is increasingly dominated by pan-India spectacles, one actor has carved a space unlike any other: Prabhas. Since the historic success of Baahubali 2: The Conclusion in 2017, Prabhas has become the face of opening day euphoria. No matter the genre, no matter the competition, his films have consistently stormed into theatres with earth-shattering day-one numbers, something even other superstars, despite their stature and talent, have struggled to replicate.And post Baahubali 2, the actor has not done even one sequel thereby taking out the last film’s buzz into account.Baahubali 2 didn’t just change Prabhas’s career; it changed the very grammar of Indian box office reporting. The SS Rajamouli-directed epic opened to record numbers, rewriting the rules of how big a film could go. It was the first film to cross the Rs 1000 crore mark. It also cemented Prabhas as the first genuine pan-India superstar from the South, with fan bases cutting across linguistic and geographical boundaries. Suddenly, Day 1 numbers became the currency of stardom, and every new big-ticket release was compared to the Baahubali phenomenon.The Day 1 StreakWhat makes Prabhas unique is his ability to sustain the “event film” aura beyond Baahubali. While other actors from the South have occasionally breached big numbers, Prabhas has done so consistently, with almost every outing (barring Radhe Shyam).Saaho: Despite mixed reviews and criticism of its screenplay, Saaho stormed into theatres with a Rs 89 crore opening across languages. The film’s scale, action set pieces, and Prabhas’s aura carried it to one of the biggest first days for an Indian film at the time.The film earned over Rs 300 crore at the box office. Radhe Shyam: A rare miss, this romantic drama marked a departure from Prabhas’s mass-action image. With a softer genre and limited appeal in the Hindi belt, the film managed Rs 43.1 crore on opening day—a number still respectable, but far from the benchmark audiences expected.The film folded up at Rs 104 crore.Adipurush: In spite of polarizing reactions and social media criticism, Om Raut’s mythological epic earned a massive Rs 86.75 crore on its opening day. Once again, Prabhas’s star power drove audiences into theatres, underlining his consistent box office draw, the film went on to collect Rs 288.15 crore.Salaar: Part 1 - Ceasefire: Directed by Prashanth Neel of KGF fame, Salaar capitalized on high-octane action and Prabhas’s rugged persona, delivering a Rs 90.7 crore Day 1. The film went on to cement itself as one of the top grossers of the year with Rs 406 crore collection.Kalki 2898 AD : India’s most ambitious sci-fi spectacle lived up to its billing, scoring a record Rs 95.3 crore opening day. The film not only proved Prabhas’s ability to lead big-ticket projects but also showed how his films transcend regional limitations to appeal to audiences across India. The film went on to become one the biggest hits of Indian Cinema with Rs 646 crore collection. This consistent streak—where four out of his last five major films opened above Rs 85 crore is unparalleled in Indian cinema.The Outlier: Radhe ShyamIt’s worth noting that Radhe Shyam’s comparatively lower opening was not due to waning star power but because of a genre mismatch. Prabhas’s fanbase, built on high-octane action spectacles and mythological grandeur, found it difficult to reconcile with a European-set romantic tragedy. Even then, Rs 43.1 crore was no small feat, especially for a film that lacked the mass pull of an action entertainer.Prabhas’s trajectory has had ripple effects across the Indian film industry. Seeing his success, other South Indian superstars began positioning themselves as pan-India actors, dubbing their films in Hindi and expanding release footprints. However, not everyone has managed to match his consistency.Ram Charan: After the massive success of RRR which earned Rs 133 crore on day 1 , his standalone project Game Changer opened to Rs 51 crore solid, but nowhere near Prabhas’s standard as the film fizzled out within the first week.Jr NTR: His post-RRR collection of Rs 133 crore his film Devara debuted at Rs 82.5 crore, just shy of the Rs 85 crore mark, but his next outing War 2 dropped to Rs 52 crore.Allu Arjun: The one exception is Pushpa 2, which exploded with a staggering Rs 164.25 crore Day 1, thanks largely to the carryover craze from Pushpa: The Rise. However, this is more the story of a sequel with unprecedented Hindi market penetration than a sustainable trend across multiple films.This contrast makes Prabhas stand out: his Day 1 numbers are not tied to sequels or Rajamouli but to his own brand value.Why Prabhas WorksSeveral factors explain why Prabhas continues to be the “Day 1 King”:Pan-India Appeal: Unlike most South stars who still have their strongest pull in specific states, Prabhas enjoys near-equal fanbases across Telugu, Tamil, and Hindi markets. His films are marketed simultaneously as national events.Event-Style Projects: Be it Saaho, Salaar, or Kalki 2898 AD, his projects are mounted on massive budgets with VFX, scale, and action that demand big-screen viewing. Audiences know a Prabhas release will be an event, not just a film.With his next Raja Saab he is once again experimenting with horror-comedy. Mystique of Baahubali: The afterglow of Baahubali 2 still lingers. For many audiences, Prabhas is etched as the face of India’s greatest blockbuster, giving him a credibility few can replicate.Global Strategy: Prabhas’s films are planned with worldwide releases in mind, ensuring massive screen counts across India and overseas, which naturally boost Day 1 numbers.The Day 1 figure has now become an industry-wide obsession, and much of that credit (or blame) goes to Prabhas. His consistency has raised expectations for every South Indian superstar attempting pan-India cinema. Audiences and trade analysts now measure stardom not only by lifetime collections but also by the ability to open big on the very first day.In the crowded and competitive world of Indian cinema, Prabhas stands tall as the only actor who has made Rs 85 crore+ Day 1 openings his trademark. From Saaho to Salaar, from Adipurush to Kalki 2898 AD, he has proven time and again that his name alone can drive audiences to theatres in record numbers.While others may score occasionally, consistency is the true marker of stardom. And in that respect, Prabhas is unrivalled—not just in the South, but across India."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorJigar ShahWith nearly 14 years of experience as an entertainment journalist, I have established my credibility in the industry.

(Picture Courtesy: Facebook) Veteran actor and writer V.K. Sreeraman has now opened up about further updates regarding the legendary actor Mammootty's health and also glimpses into their deep bond.Mammootty says -'Food had no taste, smell was gone'Sreeraman revealed to Manorama News that Mammootty himself had spoken about the struggles he faced in the early stages of treatment. “During the early stages of treatment, he said food had no taste and he had lost his sense of smell. Now all that has changed. He’ll soon return to the crowd. Mammootty himself called and said he is completely cured,” he said.Despite the difficult phase, Sreeraman noted that Mammootty never allowed his illness to define him. “There’s never been any sign of weakness in his voice, never like a patient’s.

Pivot!” While Chandler grows more frustrated and his sarcastic delivery of “Shut up, shut up, shut uuuup!” is one of the funniest lines in the entire series also Chandler’s mixture of exhaustion and wit is what makes the scene so hilarious.5/6​Eating cheesecake off the floorChandler and Rachel accidentally find a cheesecake that doesn’t belong to them, but it tastes so good they can’t resist. At first, they sneak bites, then they argue over it, and eventually, the cheesecake falls on the floor. Instead of stopping, both Chandler and Rachel sit down and eat it off the floor with forks. The sight of Chandler fully enjoying food in such an absurd situation is hilarious.6/6​The bunny costume fiascoIn the Halloween episode, Chandler shows up dressed as a giant pink bunny because Monica wanted him to wear it and his embarrassment is clear from the moment he walks in, and his sarcastic complaints make the costume even funnier. When Joey arrives dressed as Chandler, the situation gets even more hilarious and also Chandler, who always prided himself on being sarcastic and smart, is forced into looking completely ridiculous.Follow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousNayanthara’s transformation: Glowing brighter with timeindiaTop 5 zodiac signs who are truly spiritual soulsindia9 vegetarian-friendly

It earned a lot of money on the first day in Tamil Nadu. The film made Rs 216 crore in India in just six days. Coolie is now Rajinikanth's third-biggest movie in India.

It earned a lot of money on the first day in Tamil Nadu. The film made Rs 216 crore in India in just six days. Coolie is now Rajinikanth's third-biggest movie in India. Only 2.0 and Jailer earned more. Rajinikanth is still a big star even with younger actors coming up.  Rajinikanth has once again proven why he remains the undisputed superstar of Indian cinema. His latest release, Coolie directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj, has stormed the box office and officially emerged as the megastar’s third biggest hit in India, standing tall behind 2.0 (2018) and Jailer (2023).Released with massive anticipation, Coolie opened to a thunderous Rs 65 crore Day 1, the highest-ever for Rajinikanth in Tamil Nadu. The film’s first weekend collections were rock solid, with Rs 54.75 crore on Friday, Rs 39.5 crore on Saturday, and Rs 35.25 crore on Sunday, taking the opening four-day total to Rs 194.5 crore. Despite the usual weekday drop, the film still managed to earn Rs 12 crore on Monday and an estimated Rs 9.5 crore on Tuesday, pushing its six-day India total to Rs 216 crore.‘Coolie’ release sparks madness: Rajinikanth fans dance and flood theatres in Tamil NaduWhen compared to Rajinikanth’s previous blockbusters, Coolie is now firmly positioned as his third-biggest grosser in India. 2.0, directed by Shankar, remains on top with a mammoth Rs 407.05 crore India net, followed by Nelson’s Jailer, which amassed Rs 348.55 crore during its run. Coolie though has been losing audience with each passing day but it is still running strong with the current trend the film is eyeing a lifetime total in the Rs 275-300 crore range if the films gets a huge push in the coming weekend.PollIs 'Coolie' likely to reach a lifetime total of Rs 275-300 crore?Yes, it has the potential.No, it's losing audience.The film’s success highlights Rajinikanth’s enduring box office power even in an era dominated by younger stars and pan-India spectacles. Unlike 2.0, which was mounted as a high-budget sci-fi extravaganza with a wider Hindi market appeal, and Jailer, which benefitted from tremendous word-of-mouth, Coolie is a more mass-oriented Rajinikanth vehicle. Yet, its ability to pull in over Rs 200 crore within a week underscores the superstar’s unshakable connect with audiences.For context, recent South biggies from contemporaries haven’t delivered with the same consistency. While Jailer and Pushpa 2 broke records, many other star vehicles have seen steep drops post-opening. In contrast, Rajinikanth’s films have continued to command historic openings and sustained runs, proving his unparalleled stature across decades.With Coolie officially becoming his third highest-grossing film in India, Rajinikanth now holds the rare distinction of delivering three of Tamil cinema’s all-time biggest blockbusters in different genres and phases of his career. At 74, the Thalaivar shows no signs of slowing down, reminding the industry why he remains its most bankable icon. His next is going to be Jailer 2 with Nelson with talks already happening about collaborating with Lokesh again for a film with Kamal Haasan.

Deepika Padukone and Yuvraj Singh's relationship was short-lived. Sushmita Sen denied wedding rumours with Wasim Akram. Amrita Singh and Ravi Shastri's romance ended in the 1980s.  Bollywood and cricket are two worlds that capture the hearts of millions, not just in India but across the globe. With glamour on one side and sports stardom on the other, it’s no surprise that rumours of romances often make headlines. From dinner dates to spotted outings, the public is always curious to know if a Bollywood actress is secretly seeing a cricket star. Some rumours are quickly dismissed, while others linger for years. Let’s take a closer look at the actresses who were linked to cricketers.Sara Ali Khan and Shubman GillSara Ali Khan sparks dating buzz after gurudwara visit with rumoured beau Arjun BajwaRumours of a relationship between Sara Ali Khan and cricketer Shubman Gill began when they were spotted together on a dinner date. However, Sara addressed the speculation on 'Koffee With Karan' Season 8. With humour, she said, “You have got the wrong Sara, guys. Sara ka sara duniya galat Sara ke peechay pada hai.” This may have been a reference to Sara Tendulkar, daughter of cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar, who was also rumoured to be dating the young cricketer.Nidhhi Agerwal and KL RahulNidhhi Agerwal, who works in Telugu, Tamil and Hindi films, was rumoured to be dating cricketer KL Rahul after they were seen together several times. Both made it clear they were only friends. KL Rahul had told NDTV, “I have known her for a long time, we both come from the same city. It's great to see the progress she is making in her field. We have known each other even when I was a cricketer and she was a Bollywood actress. It was not just me and her hanging out, there were three or four more people from Bangalore. It's good to catch up with friends and I assure you there is nothing happening.” KL Rahul is now married to actress Athiya Shetty, and the couple welcomed daughter Evaarah earlier this yearPollShould celebrities openly address relationship rumors more often?Yes, it avoids misunderstandingsNo, personal life should stay privateIzabelle Leite and Virat KohliBrazilian model and actress Izabelle Leite seen in movies like ‘Talaash’ reportedly dated cricketer Virat Kohli for almost two years. She had told Bollywood Hungama, “Virat was one of the first Indian friends I had when I came to India. We were dating for quite a while. We were together for almost two years. But we didn't want to make it public. So yeah, Virat and I did have a relationship. But Sidharth is only my friend and yes, we do spend time together as well.”Deepika Padukone and Yuvraj SinghBack in time, Deepika Padukone and cricketer Yuvraj Singh were seen together on dinner dates, leading to dating rumours. As quoted by Telegraph India, Yuvraj explained, “I had just come back from South Africa and we met through common friends in Mumbai. We liked each other and wanted to know more.” However, their busy schedules prevented a long-term relationship.He added, “We didn’t spend enough time with each other to know if it was going to be a long-term thing. As things turned out she moved on and so did I. Well, she was with me and now she's moved on with another person. I guess it's her personal choice. If someone wants to move out of a relationship, there isn't much that the other person can do. I am not blaming anyone but just stating the facts.”Sushmita Sen and Wasim AkramSushmita Sen and Pakistani cricketer Wasim Akram were judging the reality show 'Ek Khiladi Ek Haseena' in 2008. Their closeness sparked rumours of a relationship, as they were seen together on multiple occasions. Sushmita later cleared the air on social media, “Hi guys! Been reading about my upcoming wedding with Wasim... ABSOLUTE RUBBISH!!! Goes to show just how irresponsible media can be sometimes! Wasim Akram is a friend and will always be one!! He has a wonderful lady in his life... rumours like these are uncalled for n disrespectful! My beautiful people..when I find 'THE ONE'...you'll be the first to know :)) benefits of being my twitter family!! ;) love u all soooooo much.”Amrita Singh and Ravi ShastriBack in the 1980s, Amrita Singh and cricketer Ravi Shastri were rumoured to be dating. Amrita was often seen cheering for Ravi from the stands. However, the relationship ended, and both went on to marry other people, Amrita tied the knot with Saif Ali Khan and Ravi married Ritu Singh. In a throwback video Ravi had recalled a shy first meeting with Amrita, “When I first met my girlfriend, Amrita, you might know her from films, it was at a restaurant in Mumbai. For the first ten minutes, I didn't say a word. I always knew I was shy around girls, but I didn't expect to be completely speechless. She kept talking for the entire ten minutes. It was one of my most embarrassing moments.”"Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

He highlights the couple's request for authentic, unretouched images and the overwhelming reach of his work, even to unexpected corners of India. While unfazed by Virat, Radhik admits being star-struck photographing Priyanka Chopra's wedding to Nick Jonas.  Celebrity photographer Joseph Radhik, who captured the intimate and dreamy wedding of Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma in Tuscany in 2017, has opened up about his experience, capturing priceless moments from the couple's special day. Shooting the Virushka weddingThe celebrity photographer, who appeared on a news channel, spilled the beans about the hush-hush wedding and revealed why it still is his favourite celebrity wedding to date. Calling it one of the most defining moments of his career, Radhik revealed to News18, "When I shot Virat-Anushka's wedding in 2017, it was extremely special for me. It is a photographer's dream for their work to be seen by a few million people. To think that my work went so viral in that moment, and to think that so many people saw it across the world... that was surreal.”Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma’s Secret London Date Caught on CameraPhotos going viralThe photographer also recalled how overwhelming it was to see his images reach unexpected corners of India. While admitting other photographers often argue about the copyright of their images, he said, "But I was on the other end, super happy, grinning to see my images on places like a barber shop in Udaipur, on a pathaka dabba, or somewhere on the back of an auto. That entire year after Virat and Anushka's wedding was sublime.”Favourite photoWhen asked to pick his favourite photo from the entire wedding album, he revealed that Virat kissing Anushka on her forehead during the wedding celebrations was his favourite. Anushka's brief before the weddingWhen asked about the brief given to him, Radhik shared that Anushka had only one request, which was - to keep the images real. He shared with the portal, “Their input primarily was that I should be there to document the wedding, so that the world can see the kind of wedding they had, without any input from me or them during those moments."The photographer, who has been the man behind some of the biggest celeb weddings to date, including Vicky Kaushal and Katrina Kaif to Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas, he shared, "The brides mostly gave me the brief." He went on to add that when it came to Virat and Anushka's wedding, the photos were not even retouched in any way. He pointed out, "You can even see the crow's feet near their eyes. None of these images were retouched. It was just me editing and sharing them within minutes."On being star-struckDespite being a lifelong cricket fan, Radhik said he did not feel star-struck photographing the star couple. He noted, "Those two were just so happy, there was no star presence around them. I was just grinning from left to right that day."However, he admitted that one celebrity wedding did leave him awe-struck was that of Priyanka Chopra’s grand wedding to Nick Jonas. “I’ve always been a Desi Girl fan. When she was getting ready in her red lehenga, Mickey Contractor doing her makeup, I just thought, ‘Oh my God, I’m photographing Priyanka Chopra’s wedding,’” he confessed.Viral and Anushka were recently in the news when the two were spotted enjoying a quiet day out and about the streets of London. The couple was seen rocking a casual look as they stepped out and even spent a while chatting with locals around a street corner. According to reports they have decided to shift base to the UK to raise their two children Vamika and Akaay, away from the spotlight."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Mohit Suri's romantic musical drama, 'Saiyaara,' starring Ahaan Panday and Anette Padda, has grossed Rs 325.11 crore in 33 days. Despite competition from 'Coolie' and 'War 2,' the film sustained footfalls, driven by positive word-of-mouth and repeat viewings, especially among younger audiences. Cinema chains have re-added shows due to continued demand. 'Saiyaara' has become the 14th biggest hit in Hindi cinema. Mohit Suri’s Saiyaara, starring Ahaan Panday and Anette Padda, has crossed yet another milestone at the box office. The romantic musical drama has now collected Rs 325.11 crore in 33 days. The film has added Rs 2.51crore to its collection since the release of Rajinikanth’s Coolie and Hrithik Roshan-Jr NTR starrer War 2 which accounted for most screens across the country.The film opened to a steady start on Day 1 with Rs 21.5 crore, followed by strong weekday hold and an impressive weekend surge, peaking at Rs 35.75 crore on its third day. By the end of its first week the film had collected Rs 172.75 crore, Week 2 stood at Rs 107.75 crore, Week 3 was at 28.25 crore and in Week 4 the film collected Rs 14.1 crore and after counting six days of week 5, the film’s total collection now stands at RS 325.11 crore. Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda’s chemistry steals the show at 'Saiyaara' success bashWhile facing tough competition from Coolie and War 2 and with least number of shows in its journey the film maintained a steady inflow of footfalls. Word of mouth and repeat viewing, especially among younger audiences who connected with its music and tender love story, kept the numbers ticking. As soon as the weekend rush for Coolie and War 2 began to stabilize, cinema chains across the country took note of the sustained demand for Saiyaara. This week, several multiplexes and even single-screen theatres have re-added shows for the film to cater to its growing popularity.This renewed demand comes at a crucial juncture. On Day 33, Saiyaara added Rs31 lakhs to its tally, pushing the film past the coveted Rs 325 crore benchmark. The film has already become the 14th biggest hit of Hindi Cinema but it seems unlikely the film will be able to make it to the 13th rank as that is taken by Salman Khan’s Tiger Zinda Hai with Rs 339.16 crore collection.

Despite competition from 'War 2', 'Coolie' reaffirms Rajinikanth's box office dominance. 'Mahavatar Narsimha', an animated film, has earned Rs 215.49 crore, marking a milestone as the first Indian animation to cross Rs 200 crore, highlighting diverse audience preferences.

Rajinikanth's 'Coolie' has swiftly grossed Rs 216 crore in six days, surpassing 'Mahavatar Narsimha' as the third-highest grosser of 2025. Despite competition from 'War 2', 'Coolie' reaffirms Rajinikanth's box office dominance. 'Mahavatar Narsimha', an animated film, has earned Rs 215.49 crore, marking a milestone as the first Indian animation to cross Rs 200 crore, highlighting diverse audience preferences. The year 2025 has already proven to be a landmark year for Indian cinema at the box office. From big-ticket star vehicles to high-concept experiments, audiences have turned out in large numbers, rewarding both spectacle and novelty. This week, Rajinikanth’s Coolie added another milestone to the record books by edging out Mahavatar Narsimha to become the third biggest grosser of the year so far, amassing Rs 216 crore in just six days of its release.The first two spots have been captured by Vicky Kaushal's Chhaava with Rs 601.57 crore and Mohit Suri's Saiyaara with Rs 325.11 crore. When it comes to Coolie it's major collections have come from Tamil version while for Mahavatar Narsimha, the Hindi version has led the charge. According to trade figures, Coolie opened with a thunderous Rs 65 crore on Thursday, riding on Rajinikanth’s pan-India appeal and high anticipation surrounding Lokesh Kanagaraj’s directorial. The film maintained strong momentum over its extended opening weekend, posting Rs 54.75 crore on Friday, Rs 39.5 crore on Saturday, and Rs 35.25 crore on Sunday. Even though collections dropped on Monday and Tuesday Rs 12 crore and Rs 9.5 crore respectively, the six-day total stood at a formidable Rs 216 crore.Rajinikanth turns 50 in cinema: Fans go crazy, stars shower praiseThis tally puts Coolie just above Mahavatar Narsimha, which is holding out on screens despite facing competition from all big films since its release. The film in its 25 day run till now has collected Rs 215.49 crore. While the difference is marginal, the achievement is significant considering the competition both films faced in their theatrical journeys.For Rajinikanth, Coolie reaffirms his box office dominance after Jailer, and now joins his career’s biggest successes behind 2.0 and Jailer. The film’s success comes despite clashing with War 2 headlined by Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR.On the other hand, Mahavatar Narsimha deserves equal recognition for carving its own unique chapter in 2025’s box office story. Directed by Ashwin Kumar, the animated mythological spectacle defied conventional expectations by not only sustaining against heavyweights like Saiyaara, Son of Sardaar 2, War 2, and eventually Coolie, but also by emerging as the first Indian animation film ever to cross the Rs 200 crore mark. The Hindi version of the film has till now collected Rs 163.49 crore making it the sixth biggest Hindi hit of the year, trailing behind Aamir Khan’s Sitaare Zameen Par in the Hindi market.What makes this comparison remarkable is the sheer contrast between the two films. Coolie is a Rajinikanth action entertainer designed for mass appeal, while Mahavatar Narsimha relied on storytelling innovation and the growing acceptance of animation features in India. That both films managed to cross Rs 215 crore in the same year underscores the diversity of Indian audiences’ tastes and their willingness to embrace both spectacle and substance.But while the box office collection is similar, Mahavatar is already into profit zone and its return on investment is going to be huge as compared to Coolie which is losing audience with each passing day. The true test for Coolie would be if the collections can spike over the second weekend as no new big film is releasing.
