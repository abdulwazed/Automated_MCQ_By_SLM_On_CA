Pushing boundaries: How six-hitting changed T20 cricket; India’s surge in the big-hit race
T20 cricket has undergone a six-hitting revolution, transforming batting from risk-averse accumulation to power-driven aggression. India, once lagging behind, now match the world’s best with a six every 12 balls in 2024. With IPL and internationals fuelling the trend, six-hitting is now the currency of modern T20 cricket.

India, once lagging behind, now match the world’s best with a six every 12 balls in 2024. With IPL and internationals fuelling the trend, six-hitting is now the currency of modern T20 cricket. Abhishek Sharma  (TOI) NEW DELHI: Abhishek Sharma's father Rajkumar Sharma used to get really annoyed while coaching him at the Gandhi Stadium in Amritsar. Sharma says he once got so miffed that he didn’t allow him to bat for a couple of days as punishment. In Delhi, Sanjay Bharadwaj, who has coached the likes of Gautam Gambhir, Amit Mishra, Joginder Sharma, and Unmukt Chand, scolded his NextGen ward Priyansh Arya for always looking to hit glory shots.The two southpaws are still hitting sixes for fun, but their intent forced their respective coaches to change their approach. "Priyansh added that new armoury in my coaching craft. His style of batting forced me to adapt," Bharadwaj told TimesofIndia.com after Priyansh scored a stunning 39-ball century against Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in IPL 2025. Asia Cup 2025: India Squad Announced | Surya Named Captain, Gill Vice-CaptainHitting a six was once a rarity in cricket; coaches often reprimanded players because playing in the ‘V’ was considered the correct way of batting. Today, if you want to find a place in T20 sides as a batter, the ability to clear the boundary at will is non-negotiable.The T20 format has also evolved since its inception almost two decades ago. Earlier, most teams followed the ODI template in T20Is -- exploit the powerplay, save wickets in the middle, and then go all guns blazing in the last five or six overs.But over time, the notion that T20s are just a shorter version of ODIs has been firmly discarded. The format has built its own identity, where hitting sixes and scoring at a higher strike rate form the very foundation of batting.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!With more and more data available, teams realised that scoring quickly is more valuable than preserving wickets at the cost of a slower scoring rate. As a result, line-ups were stacked with power-hitters in the middle order, and players capable of clearing the ropes at will were valued more than accumulators.The six-hitting revolutionConsider this: In 2025, Australia struck 92 sixes in just 8 T20Is, averaging one every 9.5 balls - the second-best six-hitting rate in a calendar year, behind only West Indies’ 157 sixes in 13 matches at 9.2 balls per six in 2023.In 2012, T20 matches saw a six once every 27 deliveries. Since then, the frequency has risen every year, with sixes becoming increasingly common. West Indies were the first big T20 team to crack this code: sixes are the real currency in T20s, the most efficient way to maximise value from each of the 120 deliveries.PollWho do you think is the best power-hitter in T20 cricket today?Abhishek SharmaSuryakumar YadavOther notable playersIn 2016, the T20 World Cup champion West Indies men’s team struck sixes every 16.3 balls against the top seven teams, compared to once every 22.5 balls by other sides in the top eight against each other.In the eight matches they played during the 2015-16 season, the Caribbeans hit 68 sixes in 938 balls faced -- a six every 13.79 deliveries.Where do India’s batters stand?

They struck 64 sixes in 1,162 balls across 10 innings -- one every 18.15 balls.In 2024, the year India dominated world cricket by winning 24 out of 26 matches culminating in their T20 World Cup triumph, their six-hitting touched a whole new level. Across 26 outings, India hit a six every 12.19 balls.IPL stats highlight the same trend. In 2021, out of 13,952 balls faced, batters hit 687 sixes -- one every 20.3 balls.By contrast, IPL 2025 saw 1,294 sixes from 16,514 balls -- a stunning frequency of one every 12.76 balls.The age of power-hittersThe evolution of T20 cricket has been fuelled by the six-hitting revolution. With the arrival of T20 specialists like Abhishek Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav, the art of clearing the ropes has reached unprecedented levels.The fact that 10 wickets are available to be spent in 120 balls changes the dynamics of risk and reward in batting.As a result, batters who are exceptionally good at “hitting” (maximising runs per delivery) have become more valuable than traditional accumulators.We are far from the time when T20s resembled a shortened version of ODIs. The direction is clear: sixes will keep coming more frequently, scores will rise higher, and bowlers will be pushed further to the margins of the format, whether the guardians of cricket like it or not.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Sanju Samson  Shubman Gill's selection as vice-captain for the upcoming Asia Cup in the UAE has sparked discussions about Sanju Samson's position in India's T20 team, despite his inclusion in the squad. The order in which selection committee chairman Ajit Agarkar announced the team has led to speculation about the final playing XI, with Gill possibly opening alongside Abhishek Sharma in India's first match against Oman.Chief selector Ajit Agarkar's announcement sequence, naming Gill and Jitesh Sharma before Samson and Rinku Singh, has fueled speculation about team composition. This has raised questions about Samson's role, despite his recent success as an opener.India Asia Cup squad: Why Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill are biggest talking pointsThe batting order appears likely to feature Tilak Varma, Suryakumar Yadav, Shivam Dube, Hardik Pandya, and Axar Patel from positions three to seven. This arrangement leaves limited opportunities for Samson at the top order.Former India spinner R Ashwin has made a scathing attack on Team India's management for picking Shubman Gill in the side."They are thinking of Shubman Gill as the leader for the future. Maybe he can be the all-format captain. But it is not necessary to have the same captain in all formats,” Ashwin said on his YouTube channel "Ash Ki Baat."PollWho do you think should open the batting for India against Oman?Shubman GillAbhishek SharmaBoth of them“What is sadder is that you have announced Gill as the vice-captain, so Sanju Samson's place is also under threat. Sanju is not going to play. Shubman Gill will play, and he will open the batting,” he added. Agarkar addressed the selection matter by deferring to the team management's decision. "The captain-coach will take the call on the best balance for the team. Once we get to Dubai, we will have a bit more clarity. With more options available now, Shubman has been in great form for the last few months. So has Sanju, so two good options, along with Abhishek," he stated.Samson, who captains Rajasthan Royals in the IPL, now faces an uncertain wait before the Asia Cup begins, despite his recent performances.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

In the latest update, August 19, neither of India's ex-captains find a spot in the top-10 rankings.In last week's update, Rohit was in the No. 2 spot with 756 points while Kohli stood in the fourth place with 736 points. Now, Shubman Gill is the leading batter in ODI rankings with 784 rating points and Shreyas Iyer in sixth on 704 points.

(Image: ICC)Neither Rohit or Kohli have played any cricket since IPL 2025 while their last appearance in India's colours came in March in the Champions Trophy final against New Zealand.Do players disappear from the ICC Rankings?Yes. As per ICC's rules on rankings, a player can be removed from the top-100 spots if they've not played a match within the qualifying period - 12-15 months for Tests and 9-12 months for ODIs and T20Is.Alternatively, a player can be removed from the rankings for good if they retire from a format or completely from international cricket. ICC, in its rulebook, explains that when MS Dhoni retired from Tests in 2014, he was removed from the Test rankings, but remained in the ODI rankings.This is why Kohli and Rohit are not presented in the latest Test and T20I rankings considering they've bowed out from both formats. Both retired from the shortest format after winning the 2024 T20 World Cup and from Tests in May this year.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

His elevation signals a strategic move by the BCCI, potentially positioning him as a future all-format captain and a key figure in Indian cricket's brand identity. Shubman Gill (PTI Photo)  The selection of Shubman Gill as vice-captain of India’s T20 team for the Asia Cup is neither a surprise nor out of place.Barring the 2024 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), when he didn’t play his full quota of matches and finished 12th among the top-scorers that year, Gill has either topped the batting charts in the T20 league in the remaining seasons over the last five years or has managed to figure in the top five. In fact, when he top scored in the 2023 edition with 870 runs, it was only second to the most number of runs ever scored by a batter in the IPL — 973 runs in 2016 by Virat Kohli. It was Gill’s season with the bat and the rest were merely spectators soaking it all in.India Asia Cup squad: Why Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill are biggest talking pointsThe kind of aggression, consistency, approach and leadership that Gill has managed to show in the last few years of the IPL — the single-biggest platform that allows the selectors to do their T20 math before putting together a good team — didn’t leave Ajit Agarkar and his team with much of a choice but to bring him in. In a squad of 15, there was no chance of leaving the man aside.But then there are those who might ask, why the vice-captaincy? Has Gill done enough to slip into the leadership role in the shortest format, or is it a natural extension of the role he’s acquired in Test cricket, where BCCI’s possibly indicating that he could be India’s future all-format captain? Is Gill set to follow MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma and be the fourth in line very soon?23 years and 146 days23 years and 146 days - Shubman Gill's age when he scored his only T20I hundred, against New Zealand in Ahmedabad on February 1, 2023, making him the youngest Indian to score hundreds in all three formats in international cricket.Well, now that we’ve concluded that his selection in the team is by no degree an unwarranted one, let’s move on to understanding why his elevation as vice-captain in not unwarranted either.Shubman Gill in IPL over the yearsYearMatNoRunsHSAvgBFSR10050Career11817386612939.452787138.72426202515265093*50.00417155.8806202412142610438.73289147.4012202317289012959.33564157.803420221624839634.50365132.330420211704785728.11402118.9003202014144070*33.84373117.960320191442967632.88238124.3603201813520357*33.83139146.0401As much as the sport derives traction from the field, there’s a lot that happens off it also that keeps the Indian cricket ticking — revenues, broadcast, sponsorships, fan engagement and more. Every now and then, when broadcast rights or sponsorship slots go on sale, the cricket board ends up burning the midnight oil trying to figure the right value.In any kind of value creation, only brand and consistency matter. From the days of Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid, to 2007 when India struck the T20 goldmine and MS Dhoni emerged, to 2015 onwards, when Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma singlehandedly moved the brand needle in Indian cricket to the next level — there’s always been a face that Indian cricket could identify with.PollWill Shubman Gill become the future all-format captain of India?DefinitelyPossiblyUnlikelyIn 2024, ‘who next?’ was the question that began to pop up inside BCCI boardrooms. It is in search of this space that the cricket board began identifying Shubman Gill. It wasn’t some random out-of-the-blue selection hunch that elevated him to Test captaincy earlier this year. It isn’t some random selection hunch that’s elevated him to T20 captaincy either.Tuesday’s selection had a massive future connotation to it.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

You have to speak to the players, you have to go through the sadness."I just hope Shreyas Iyer and Yashasvi Jaiswal were given a call, and they were told the reasons behind not being picked.“Genuinely, I understand Shubman Gill's selection. He is also the vice-captain. He has scored a lot of runs for the Gujarat Titans in the IPL. He has the credentials to be picked in the T20I setup,” he added.Gill, 25, returned to the 15-man squad as deputy to skipper Suryakumar Yadav, thanks to the stellar role he played with the bat in the recent Test series against England.PollDo you agree with Ashwin's opinion on the exclusion of Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shreyas Iyer from the Asia Cup squad?Yes, it's unfairNo, the selections are justifiedNot sureI don't follow cricket closelyThe top-order batsman scored 754 runs as India's relatively young squad fought from behind to square the five-match series 2-2.The eight-nation Asia Cup will be the first major event in the build-up to next year's T20 World Cup in India in February and March.Gill, who was named Test skipper after the retirement of veterans Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli earlier this year, last played a T20 international in July 2024.“When you have Yashasvi Jaiswal as the third opener in the T20 World Cup 2024, to remove someone from the World Cup squad and bring in Shubman Gill... I mean, it's okay, I am happy for Shubman, but I'm very sad for both Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shreyas Iyer.

(AP Photo/Rajanish Kakade) Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh lambasted chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar for leaving out two “X-factor” players from India’s 15-member squad for the Asia Cup.“I feel that Siraj’s name should have been included as well. Siraj bowled very well in the recent series," Harbhajan said on his YouTube channel.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

The bowling unit would have seemed stronger. I feel that the ‘X-factor’ Siraj brings might be somewhat missed," he added.Another omission that surprised Harbhajan was the absence of Shreyas Iyer from the squad.“I had hoped he (Shreyas Iyer) would get a place in the team. He scored a lot of runs, played in the IPL final, and was in very good form."I thought his name could have been there. As for whose spot he would take, that is for the selectors to decide."When someone has to be included or left out, a spot is made. But I did not see Shreyas Iyer’s name there, which surprised me a little," he added.The Asia Cup will begin on September 9, with defending champions India set to face hosts United Arab Emirates a day later in Dubai in the eight-nation tournament.PollIs Shreyas Iyer's exclusion from the squad surprising?Absolutely surprisingNot surprising at allSomewhat surprisingI don't follow the team closelyIndia and arch-rivals Pakistan have been placed in Group A and will clash on September 14.Pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah has also made a comeback to the T20 squad after skipping two matches in England to manage his workload.Bumrah’s last T20 outing was India’s World Cup title win over South Africa at Barbados in June 2024.With Kohli and Rohit retiring from T20 internationals after that triumph, Bumrah will lead the pace attack alongside left-arm quick Arshdeep Singh and Harshit Rana.

Chopra believes this omission sends a negative signal regarding Iyer's T20I future. Shreyas Iyer (Image credit: ICC Photo) NEW DELHI: Former India opener Aakash Chopra has expressed surprise at Shreyas Iyer’s exclusion from the reserve players list for the upcoming Asia Cup, pointing out that it doesn’t send the right message regarding his T20I future.Iyer, who piled up 604 runs at a strike rate of 175 in IPL 2025 while leading Punjab Kings to the runners-up spot, had shown marked improvement against the short ball and dominated spinners throughout the tournament. Yet, he found no place in either the 15-member squad for the Asia Cup or the five-man reserves list.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!The omission had earlier baffled former India assistant coach Abhishek Nayar, and now Chopra has voiced similar concerns. "Shreyas' name is not even there in the five reserves, and that is surprising. It's understandable that you couldn't have him in the 15 as you can't play him in the XI, and you wanted lower-order batters as backup, where Shivam Dube is there, and Rinku Singh will be given another chance, which is absolutely par for the course."However, a place could have been created in the reserve players at least, where you have kept Dhruv Jurel, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Prasidh Krishna. Shreyas’ name could have been there, but you haven't kept it there either, and that doesn't send a great signal. The clarity in front of Shreyas' name is completely not there," Chopra said on his YouTube channel on Wednesday.At the same time, Chopra believes Iyer’s international future is far from over and that he still has a pathway to the 2026 Men’s T20 World Cup if he maintains strong performances in ODIs. For now, Iyer’s immediate focus will be on representing West Zone in the Duleep Trophy, which marks the start of the 2025/26 domestic season.India Asia Cup squad: Why Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill are biggest talking points"Shreyas Iyer not being there is a big story. What more will Shreyas Iyer have to do? What more can you do than what you have already done? You had a 600-plus run IPL season, took the team to the final, scored runs in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, played Ranji, and won the Champions Trophy. That's all you can do as a human being."This is the Asia Cup team. Don't attach the World Cup with it because there are 15 T20Is after this. The world changes in 15 T20Is. If he keeps scoring runs in ODIs, sooner or later, Shreyas Iyer will be part of the team. I have a strong feeling that Shreyas Iyer will be a part of India's T20 World Cup team," he added.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Former assistant coach Abhishek Nayar questioned the decision, emphasizing Iyer's strong contention. Chief selector Ajit Agarkar acknowledged the difficulty of the decision, citing limited squad space. Shreyas Iyer (AP Photo) NEW DELHI: India’s cricket selectors sprung a surprise by leaving out Shreyas Iyer from both the 15-member Asia Cup squad and the five standby players, despite his strong showings in the Champions Trophy and IPL 2025. The announcement was made by BCCI chief selector Ajit Agarkar and T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav on Tuesday.Iyer enjoyed an excellent IPL season, guiding Punjab Kings to the final while amassing 604 runs in 17 matches at a strike rate of 175.07. He finished as the sixth-highest run-scorer of the tournament.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Former India assistant coach Abhishek Nayar voiced his disappointment at Iyer’s exclusion."I don't know, actually, I wanted to ask that question — aapke reserve players mein kaise nahi hai woh, if he is such a strong contender. Sometimes, you know, selection meetings can be quite interesting, and the discussions that happen in them can be very interesting," Nayar said on Star Sports.PollDo you agree with the exclusion of Shreyas Iyer from the Asia Cup squad?Yes, it was the right decision.No, he should have been included."But I can't fathom, and I don't understand, what reason can justify Shreyas Iyer not being part of that 20-member squad. I'm not even talking about the 15, I'm talking about the 20-member squad, which sends a message to Shreyas Iyer that he is not in the team's scheme of things. Because even if things don't work out, he is still not coming into the team. Either Riyan Parag is going to make the cut, or someone else is," he added."So, the big question here is that maybe they are not looking at him from a T20 point of view — or perhaps any other point of view. But I always say this that any selection after a while is, 'who you like a little more than the other'. In that regard, maybe Shreyas Iyer is not liked as much as someone else. Maybe."Chief selector Ajit Agarkar, meanwhile, addressed the calls regarding Iyer and Yashasvi Jaiswal."With regards to Shreyas, there's no fault of his — nor is it ours. It's just that we can only pick 15, and at the moment, he might have to wait for his chance," Agarkar explained."With regards to Yashasvi Jaiswal, it's just unfortunate again. Abhishek Sharma, with what he has done over the last few months — or a year or so that he has been with the team — plus the fact that he can bowl a little, gives us an option if required by the captain. One of these guys was always going to miss out. It's just unfortunate that Yashasvi might have to wait for his chance."Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

The winner of this prestigious continental championship will secure a spot in the 2026 FIH Hockey World Cup.Hockey India Secretary General Bhola Nath Singh questioned Pakistan's decision to pull out. "Why isn't Pakistan coming? Why are they not participating? This is not clear to us," Singh said. He firmly stated that "security and all the arrangements in India are much better than in Pakistan."Former India hockey captain and Congress MLA Pargat Singh also rejected the security concerns. "There is no such issue in India, I don't think there is any such problem in our country," he said. He pointed out that Pakistan's behaviour was disappointing from a sporting perspective.Pargat Singh also commented on Pakistan's declining hockey standards. He noted that internal disturbances had affected Pakistan's once-strong hockey program, saying "Pakistan Hockey was good once but if there are internal disturbances, everything gets affected."Despite the withdrawals, organisers remain focused on hosting a successful event. As Bhola Nath Singh emphasised, "For us, we have to organise this as a grand success, and whoever is coming, we welcome them wholeheartedly."The tournament will feature eight teams divided into two pools. Pool A includes host India, Japan, China, and Kazakhstan, while Pool B comprises Malaysia, Korea, Bangladesh, and Chinese Taipei.

I think it’s a very, very good selection," he added."He was very impressive in England. To score 750-plus runs while leading the side for the first time shows how well he handled pressure."This vice-captaincy is a clear sign that he is going to be the captain of the Indian team as well.

We can all have our opinions before the selection committee picks the team, but once the team is picked, we should back it fully."We shouldn't be saying A should've been there or B should've been there.

Imran's leadership instilled confidence in the team, demanding full commitment and intolerance for complacency on the field. Wasim Akram and Imran Khan  NEW DELHI: Pakistan pace legend Wasim Akram has opened up on what it was like to play under Imran Khan, calling the 1992 World Cup-winning skipper the greatest captain he ever played with. Akram, who began his international career in the mid-1980s, credited Imran for shaping him not only as a cricketer but also as a professional.Reflecting on his early days with Pakistan, Akram said much of his development came under Imran’s guidance. Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"I think whatever I did as a cricketer, off the field, on the field, credit goes to him. He used to give us a lot of confidence. He led from the front. He had a belief in his own ability. He was a hardworking cricketer," Akram said on Stick to Cricket.While many considered Imran a naturally gifted player, Akram stressed that his success was built on relentless effort. "People used to say I'm very naturally talented. Skipper wasn't talented. He worked hard. Remember he changed his bowling action. From 76, exactly. Changing even a little bit of action can take months, it might not happen. But he did change his action. He was so determined," Akram said.Akram emphasised that Imran’s determination and willingness to reinvent himself set an example for the entire team. His hard work, according to Akram, created a culture where no one could afford to be complacent. "I mean he was the best captain I played under. He used to give confidence to every one of us," Akram noted.PollWho do you believe is the greatest cricket captain in history?Imran KhanKapil DevSteve WaughClive LloydAt the same time, Imran was known to be tough on his players when required. Akram explained that the former skipper demanded full commitment on the field. "At times he used to shout at us because if you were lazy, fair enough. He was tough, but he was tough on the field. You give your 100%. If you don’t do well, he was okay with it," he said.However, Imran could not tolerate players who tried to shield themselves in pressure situations. "If you're trying to save yourself and say okay, it's a pressure situation, I’ll just take a back seat — he used to judge. He knew this particular player is just saving himself. So that used to annoy him a lot," Akram revealed.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Despite a rejected £110 million bid, Isak believes a change is in everyone's best interest. Newcastle responded, stating Isak remains under contract and denying any agreement for his departure, while Liverpool seeks attacking reinforcements after key player exits. Alexander Isak has not been involved in Newcastle United's pre-season games or start to the Premier League. (AP) Newcastle striker Alexander Isak has broken his silence regarding his potential transfer to Liverpool, stating his departure would be "in the best interests of everyone" amid speculation of a £110 million bid from the Merseyside club. The Swedish international, who has not played in pre-season or Newcastle's opening game, expressed his frustration over broken promises and lost trust through an Instagram post on Tuesday.Liverpool's reported £110 million bid for the 25-year-old striker was rejected by Newcastle, who are demanding a British transfer record fee of up to £150 million.Isak chose not to attend the Professional Footballers' Association awards ceremony despite being named in the Premier League 2024/25 team of the year.Alexander Isak's Instagram Story on his desired move out of Newcastle United."I've kept quiet for a long time while others have spoken. That silence has allowed people to push their own version of events, even though they know it doesn't reflect what was really said and agreed behind closed doors," Isak posted on Instagram. "The reality is that promises were made and the club has known my position for a long time. To now act as if these issues are only emerging is misleading. When promises are broken and trust is lost, the relationship can't continue. That's where things are for me right now - and why change is in the best interests of everyone, not just myself."Reports suggest Newcastle had promised Isak an improved contract but delayed due to financial sustainability rules.Newcastle responded with their own statement expressing disappointment at Isak's social media post.Statement by Newcastle United in response to Alexander Isak's social media post."We are disappointed to have been alerted to a social media post by Alexander Isak this evening," the club stated. "We are clear in response that Alex remains under contract and that no commitment has ever been made by a club official that Alex can leave Newcastle United this summer. We want to keep our best players, but we also understand players have their own wishes and we listen to their views."The club added that Isak remains part of their family and would be welcomed back when ready to rejoin his teammates.Since joining from Real Sociedad in 2022, Isak has scored 62 goals in 109 appearances for Newcastle, including the winning goal against Liverpool in the League Cup final that ended Newcastle's 70-year trophy drought.Liverpool have already invested £300 million in squad improvements this season while recouping over £200 million through sales.The Merseyside club is seeking attacking reinforcements following the departures of Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez, and the tragic death of Diogo Jota.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Axar Patel (BCCI Photo) NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer and commentator Mohammad Kaif has raised concerns over Axar Patel losing the vice-captaincy of the Indian T20I side, with Shubman Gill taking over the role. Patel, who was named deputy to Suryakumar Yadav for the five-match series against England earlier this year, was replaced following Gill’s return to T20Is after a year-long absence.Taking to social media, Kaif questioned the manner in which the change was handled.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

Axar did no wrong so he deserves an explanation," Kaif posted.Patel has cemented his place as a dependable all-rounder across formats, making key contributions in India’s T20 World Cup 2024 triumph. He was named Player of the Match in the semi-final against England for his spell of 3/23.In the final against South Africa, Patel played another pivotal role, scoring 47 off 31 balls when India were reeling at 34/3, and later dismissing Tristan Stubbs to tilt the game in India’s favor.Overall, Patel’s T20I record highlights his consistency — 531 runs at a strike rate of 139.32, along with 71 wickets at an average of 22.12 from 71 matches.India Asia Cup squad press conference: What Ajit Agarkar, Surya said on shocking callsFor the upcoming Asia Cup, India’s selectors have included two other spinners, Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy, in the squad.Among the notable exclusions are Shreyas Iyer and Yashasvi Jaiswal.

Asia Cup: Shubman Gill is breathing down Suryakumar Yadav's neck
Shubman Gill's elevation to India's T20I vice-captain is a clear sign that he might end up leading the team instead of Suryakumar Yadav in the T20I World Cup at home. There are still seven months to go to the marquee event, and in Indian cricket, things can change in seven hours.

There are still seven months to go to the marquee event, and in Indian cricket, things can change in seven hours. Shubman Gill and Suryakumar Yadav New Delhi: At the start of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, keyboard warriors had written off Shubman Gill before he could even take strike. His 754 runs in the Test series and series-levelling captaincy, as chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar rightly mentioned, "exceeded expectations." And Gill's elevation to India's T20I vice-captaincy is no fluke.Remember the India tour of Zimbabwe in 2024, which happened right after India's title triumph in the USA and Caribbean? Gill was the captain of the young Indian team, and the signs were clear that the selectors wanted him in the leadership role. Two years ago, he got the captaincy of Gujarat Titans (GT) in the Indian Premier League (IPL). In his second season, he led his team to the playoffs and then the gruelling five-match Test series in England, where he further stamped his authority.India Asia Cup squad press conference: What Ajit Agarkar, Surya said on shocking callsGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!In Indian cricket, a lot can happen in seven hours, let alone the seven months to the T20 World Cup. Shubman was labelled a misfit for T20Is, and here he is going to the Asia Cup as deputy to Suryakumar Yadav, and it makes sense he could lead the team in the 2026 T20I World Cup.Is Gill breathing down Surya's neck? The simple answer is yes.Suryakumar Yadav is still recovering from the sports hernia surgery, and TimesofIndia.com has learnt that he is not yet 100 per cent fit. The selectors have taken a gamble that he will regain his full fitness by the time the Asia Cup kicks off in the UAE next month.Surya is also not getting any younger, and in the middle of the Asia Cup, he would turn 35. This is Surya's third surgery in as many years. After an ankle surgery in 2023, the swashbuckling batter had previously undergone the same sports hernia surgery back in 2024. The recurring injuries has ended careers, and we know what happened with Bhuvneshwar Kumar.Management's back-upChief selector Ajit Agarkar has hinted that Shubman Gill is someone they are looking forward to as a captain across formats.“In both T20 cricket (IPL) and Test cricket Gill is already leading. He was also the vice-captain the last time he played in T20Is. We do see leadership qualities in him, and he showed his quality by exceeding expectations with the bat in England (during the Test series),” Agarkar told reporters on Tuesday.PollDo you think Shubman Gill has proven himself as a leader in the Indian cricket team?Yes, absolutely!Not yet, still needs to prove more.Why is Shubman the right pick?Since the time Gambhir took over the coaching role after India won the T20 World Cup, he has set a template, where he has created room for the IPL generation to take over. Since then, India's batting has reached new heights. A team that prioritises quick scoring and batting depth was able to routinely break the 250-run barrier. They went as high as 297 against Bangladesh in October 2024, which is the third-highest total in T20Is.Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson are pivotal to coach Gambhir's template. But they are a high-risk, high-reward kind of opening pair. Gambhir would not want, in a final, India to be 0/2. Shubman's inclusion will most certainly provide stability at one end, with his roommate since U-14 days, Abhishek Sharma, having the luxury to attack right from the outset.Filling big voidWith Shubman Gill, India have found a suitable face to fill the big void left by Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. With his elegant strokeplay, calm demeanour, and youthful appeal, he has already become a fan favourite and with the advertisers.Suryakumar Yadav has had an impressive track record as India’s full-time T20I captain after Rohit Sharma retired from the format following the 2024 T20 World Cup triumph. Under his leadership, India have won 17 out of 22 matches.There is no question about Surya the T20I batter -- he can entertain the crowd. But can he fill stadiums? The answer to that question is again no.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Arunachal Pradesh secured a narrow victory in the opening match, setting a promising tone for the tournament, nurturing young football talent.  Football meets shooting on rain-soaked evening in Subroto Cup (Special Arrangements)  NEW DELHI: Under ominous black clouds casting their spell over Delhi’s skyline, the Subroto Cup, India's oldest national school football tournament, roared to life with its 64th edition at the Ambedkar Stadium on Tuesday. Despite heavy rain in the morning hours of the day, leaving carpets soaked and the turf damp, hundreds of students and army officers in the stands cheered on to undo the damage dealt by the weather. Olympian and Arjuna Award-winning shooter Anjum Moudgil, the guest of honour for the opening ceremony, drew an exciting comparison between team sports like football and something deeply individual like shooting. While shooting remains less accessible compared to team sports like football in India, she said that individual sports are more lucrative than playing for a team. Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!That difference, she said, lies at the heart of how recognition comes to athletes. “Yes, they are different in terms of recognition. When you win a medal, obviously you get more attention than a team,” she told TimesofIndia.com on the sidelines of the Subroto Cup.The words of the former world number one in 50m 3 position rifle come at a time when Indian shooters are riding a wave of success. Manu Bhaker set the tone at the Paris 2024 Olympics with two bronze medals, while Suruchi Singh, Arya Borse, Arjun Babuta, Sift Kaur Samra and Elavenil Valarivan all made their mark at the ISSF World Cup of late. On Tuesday, Bhaker added another bronze at the Asian Shooting Championships in Kazakhstan. On the pitch, however, the first match of the tournament lived up to its billing. Players of Arunachal Pradesh (green) and Sainik School, Odisha, vie for the ball during the Junior Girls Under-17 match at 64th Subroto Cup International Football Tournament (PTI Photo)Arunachal Pradesh edged past Sainik School 1-0 in the junior girls’ category, thanks to an early first-half strike. Sainik School had two goals ruled out for offside, but the contest brimmed with spirit, making it a fitting start to a competition that continues to nurture India’s next generation of footballers.With the Subroto Cup bringing in yet another generation of talented footballers, and shooters continuing to collect medals on the international stage, India’s sporting future looks brighter than ever.The junior girls’ competition runs until August 28, with the sub-junior boys and junior boys categories set to follow.

While Agarkar emphasizes the captain and coach will decide the final XI, Suryakumar Yadav praised Jitesh Sharma's growth, potentially favoring him. Samson's place in the playing XI remains uncertain despite his squad inclusion, creating a nervous wait. Sanju Samson (X) Former India batter Aakash Chopra believes Shubman Gill’s return to the side has all but ended Sanju Samson’s chances of finding a place in the playing XI for the Asia Cup in the UAE. “India seems to be moving in the direction of an all-format captain. With Shubman Gill’s return, Sanju Samson’s fate has more or less been sealed. He will not feature in the playing XI now. You will not drop Tilak Varma or Hardik Pandya, which means Samson sits out and Jitesh Sharma will likely get the nod again. One thing is very clear from this selection, the batting slots have been prioritised over personalities. With Gill coming in as vice-captain, he will definitely play and open the batting. This essentially pushes Sanju Samson out of the XI,” Chopra said on JioHotstar.India Asia Cup squad press conference: What Ajit Agarkar, Surya said on shocking callsGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! The announcement of Gill as vice-captain has once again placed a question mark over Samson’s future in T20 internationals. Samson has been included in the squad, but Gill’s return has raised doubts about whether the Kerala batter will make the playing XI. The speculation has grown stronger after chief selector Ajit Agarkar read out the names in a particular order. Gill and Jitesh Sharma were mentioned first, while Samson and Rinku Singh were named towards the end. Many see this as an indication that Gill will open alongside Abhishek Sharma, while Jitesh may take the gloves and bat in the finisher’s role. With Tilak Varma, Suryakumar Yadav, Shivam Dube, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel expected to fill the middle-order positions, Samson’s opportunities look limited. Jitesh could also be preferred over Rinku Singh as a late-order pinch-hitter. Agarkar, however, played down the debate, saying the final XI would be decided by the captain and coach once the team reaches Dubai. “The captain-coach will take the call on the best balance for the team. Once we get to Dubai, we will have a bit more clarity. With more options available now, Shubman has been in great form for the last few months. So has Sanju, so two good options, along with Abhishek,” Agarkar said.PollWhich player seems most likely to take the gloves in the Asia Cup?Sanju SamsonJitesh Sharma Skipper Suryakumar Yadav added weight to Jitesh Sharma’s case, praising his transformation as a batter over the past year. “Post the last T20 World Cup, we spoke a lot on how to go about it. We said let’s not think of milestones ahead, follow your journey. He has been a completely different cricketer post that. The way he performed in the IPL and domestic tournaments, he has earned his spot again,” Surya said. The captain also defended the selection of pacer Harshit Rana, highlighting his consistency. “He has played really well in the IPL. In Pune, he came in as a concussion replacement and was Man of the Match in the last game he played for India. We back his skills, we know he can deliver,” Surya added. With both the chief selector and captain offering different signals, Samson faces another nervous wait. For now, his inclusion in the squad is not under question, but his place in the XI looks increasingly uncertain.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
