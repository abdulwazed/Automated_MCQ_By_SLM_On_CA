India captain Shubman Gill speaks during a press conference at Edgbaston, Birmingham, England, Tuesday July 1, 2025. AP/PTI(AP07_01_2025_000278A) Legendary India cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has predicted that Shubman Gill might end up leading the team in T20Is as well, after the 25-year-old was elevated as the team’s vice-captain for the Asia Cup."Not surprising at all. He (Shubman Gill) scored over 750 runs just a couple of weeks ago," Gavaskar told India Today.India Asia Cup squad: Why Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill are biggest talking pointsGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"You cannot exclude a player in that kind of form. Also, he has done really well in the IPL, which concluded just before the tour to England."It's a very good inclusion. Giving him the vice-captaincy is also a way of telling him that in the future, he could be leading the T20 side. I think it’s a very, very good selection," he added."He was very impressive in England. To score 750-plus runs while leading the side for the first time shows how well he handled pressure."This vice-captaincy is a clear sign that he is going to be the captain of the Indian team as well. It's always good to have him take responsibility just a little bit earlier,” Gavaskar said.Gavaskar also refused to comment on Yashasvi Jaiswal's omission from the squad.PollHow do you rate Shubman Gill's performance in recent matches?OutstandingGoodAveragePoor"You can only pick XI in the match and you can only pick 15 in the squad. Somebody has to miss out; that's just how it is in Indian cricket," he said."No point in discussing whether A or B or C should've been there. This is now our team. We can all have our opinions before the selection committee picks the team, but once the team is picked, we should back it fully."We shouldn't be saying A should've been there or B should've been there. That only creates controversy, which the players don't need."Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
