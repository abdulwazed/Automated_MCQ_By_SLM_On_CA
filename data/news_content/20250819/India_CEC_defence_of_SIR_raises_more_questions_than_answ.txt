"Has any database been compiled to show how many youngsters who turned 18 on the qualifying date were included?"Stalin voiced apprehension that procedures for enquiry and two appeals under Registration of Electors Rules, 1960, may exclude a huge number of voters in the impending Bihar polls. "Is EC going to address this issue? Will EC take these practical difficulties into account while conducting SIR in other states," he asked.The CM demanded that EC scrap SIR in other states, particularly Tamil Nadu, and urged DMK functionaries to be wary of addition or deletion of voters in the state ahead of the assembly polls next year.Stalin reminded EC about a DMK petition of July 17 seeking deletion of deceased voters. "When will this be done?" he asked. He wondered what prevented EC from enlisting Aadhaar as an acceptable documents to prove a voter's claims. "If free and fair elections are truly EC's aim, why can't it be more transparent and voter-friendly?"End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousPreity Mukhundhan radiates eleganceEntertainmentNeha Harsora’s dazzling and dreamy ethnic lookstvBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning weekend looks of the contestantstvFun facts about the Param Sundari actor Sidharth MalhotraEntertainment8 simple habits that will help reduce stress on the eyes and improve vision naturallyLifestyle8 times Samantha Ruth Prabhu turned perfect muse for Krésha BajajLifestyleSaree tales by actress Nisha RavikrishnantvManasi Parekh Serves Style & SmilesEntertainment10 celebrity-inspired Indian baby boy namesLifestyle10 animals that look like they are hand paintedLifestyle Next123 Photostories  How to build a timeless wardrobe inspired by Meryl StreepMovies that capture the strength of smiling through painHigh uric acid levels linked to high BP, diabetes and heart disease: Early symptoms to watch forWorld Photography Day 2025: Explore India’s most photogenic Blue Flag beachesIncredible India: Know all about the pride and joy of Puneri PagadisUrvashi Rautela turns heads with glamorous outfitBig-city girl reunites with first love in timeless Bollywood romanceKajol’s entry redefined the idea of a heroine on screenBigg Boss Telugu 9: Meet the judges of the pre-show, “Agnipariksha”Jab We Met, Bareilly Ki Barfi, Mujhse Shaadi Karogi: Binge these rom-com hits on OTT before Param Sundari123Hot PicksCP RadhakrishnanMumbai RainsHurricane Erin 2025Brooklyn Nightclub ShootingMarco RubioCrimeaBank Holidays AugustTop TrendingPatrick MahomesAntonio BrownRaheem MorrisJoy TaylorTravis Hunters WifeOlivia Paige DunneMartina NavratilovaMarco BelinelliPatrick MahomesTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteAsked to break up, Bihar couple dies by suicideFlyer arrested in Chennai for smoking onboardSC skeptical about involving HC CJ in state DGP selectionHC sees red as Assam hands over 3k bigha of land to cement companyHusband taking part in selection of AMU's 1st woman VC not proper: SCEx-Kashmir bar prez charged under UAPANoel Tata’s mother and former Tata Group director Simone Tata in critical conditionIntent to drive a person to death must for abetment conviction: SCGovt orders schools' safety audits, directs demolition of unsafe buildingsUnemployment rate slows to 5.2% in July: PLFS dataIndia Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Shubman Gill dilemma - Selectors face tough call ahead of Asia Cup squad announcementRow over Indian-origin truck driver Harjinder Singh: California Guv's office says he entered US under Trump presidency'Scared to go back to India': Truck driver Harjinder Singh who killed 3 in Florida was allowed to stay in US in 2018 on $5,000 bondStephen Curry’s wife Ayesha Curry shares an unforgettable moment of baby Cai walking on his dad’s footstepsVanessa Bryant finally breaks silence on wild pregnancy rumors with a wild response featuring a Rihanna meme'If you are trying to brain-drain Bangalore...': US economist's H-1B explanation goes viralAre Travis Hunter and Leanna Lenee really divorcing?
