The romantic drama has crossed USD 6 million in North America. It is now the third highest-grossing Indian film there. Saiyaara added nearly a million dollars in just 13 days. It is the second-highest-grossing Hindi film in North America. Mohit Suri’s Saiyaara, featuring newcomers Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda, has emerged as one of the biggest success stories of Indian cinema overseas this year. The romantic drama, which opened to warm word-of-mouth in India and abroad, has now crossed the coveted USD 6 million mark in North America, establishing itself as the third highest-grossing Indian film in the territory.The film, which had already earned USD 5.1 million till 5th August, continued its strong box office momentum in the weeks that followed. On 18th August, Saiyaara officially breached the USD 6 million milestone. That means the film added nearly a million dollars in just 13 days, a feat that underlines its consistent theatrical pull despite intense competition.‘Saiyaara’ breaks lifetime records of ‘War’ and ‘Dunki’ by crossing ₹500 cr worldwide in 18 days.The Rankings GameAmong Indian films in North America, Saiyaara now stands at No. 3, behind two heavyweight performers. At the top is Chhaava the historical epic starring Vicky Kaushal, Rashmika Mandanna, and Akshaye Khanna—which continues to lead with USD 6.4 million. Rajinikanth’s action-packed entertainer Coolie holds the second spot with USD 6.22 million.For Hindi films specifically, Saiyaara’s performance is even more remarkable. It is now the second-highest-grossing Hindi film ever in North America, trailing only Chhaava. Beating the ClashWhat makes Saiyaara’s journey more impressive is how it navigated a tough release window as after a strong run of 4 weeks the film ran into two behemoths Rajinikanth’s Coolie and Hrithik Roshan-Jr NTR’s War 2. While Coolie went on to mint USD 6.22 million in 5 days , War 2 also breached the USD 3 million mark. Yet, just as in the domestic market where it added Rs 1.90 crore in 4 days ( 14th August to 17th August) , Saiyaara managed to carve its own space overseas, proving that strong content and emotional appeal can help films rise above competition.Industry insiders point out that Mohit Suri’s brand of emotionally charged romance combined with a fresh pairing of Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda, and a well-curated music album has catapulted the film into everyone’s heart. For Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda, Saiyaara’s success is more than just box office numbers; it is a dream launch that has given them instant recognition on the global stage. And for Mohit Suri, it is yet another validation of his storytelling formula that continues to resonate with audiences across continents."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
