World’s largest radar antenna in orbit: Nasa-Isro enables 24/7 monitoring
NASA and ISRO have successfully deployed the world's largest radar antenna, a 33-foot structure, as part of the NISAR mission. Orbiting 460 miles above Earth, it will capture high-resolution radar images, penetrating clouds and darkness. This breakthrough will provide critical data on climate change, natural hazards, and agricultural trends, offering global benefits through open data access.

Orbiting 460 miles above Earth, it will capture high-resolution radar images, penetrating clouds and darkness. This breakthrough will provide critical data on climate change, natural hazards, and agricultural trends, offering global benefits through open data access.  In a landmark achievement for global space cooperation, NASA and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) have successfully deployed the world’s largest radar antenna in orbit. The 33-foot antenna, part of the joint NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission, is designed to capture Earth’s surface in unprecedented detail. Orbiting about 460 miles above the planet, the mission will provide high-resolution radar images that can penetrate clouds and operate both day and night. This breakthrough will empower scientists, policymakers, and disaster-response teams worldwide by offering critical data on climate change, natural hazards, and agricultural trends. The milestone marks a new era in Earth observation, combining advanced engineering with international collaboration.NASA, ISRO, and NISAR: Redefining Earth observationThe NISAR satellite, jointly managed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and ISRO, is equipped with dual-frequency L- and S-band synthetic aperture radar. This system allows it to track Earth’s surface changes with remarkable precision. Unlike optical satellites limited by weather or lighting conditions, NISAR provides continuous, reliable data, making it a game-changer for monitoring glaciers, forests, seismic activity, and farmlands. NASA emphasizes that this technology will revolutionize how nations prepare for disasters and manage resources.The 33-foot antenna, the largest ever used in a NASA Earth science mission, was built by Astro Aerospace, a Northrop Grumman company. Compact at launch, it expanded in orbit into its full umbrella-like shape. Engineers designed it to survive the extreme pressures of launch, the vacuum of space, and constant rotation at 4.5 revolutions per minute. This massive aperture is crucial for generating sharp radar images that will enable groundbreaking scientific studies.Synthetic aperture radar: Seeing the unseenSynthetic aperture radar (SAR) works like a powerful camera lens, simulating a larger antenna to produce high-resolution images. Using interferometric techniques, NISAR can compare radar images over time, creating 3D models of surface changes. These models can reveal subtle shifts such as slow land subsidence, early signs of landslides, or glacier retreat that would otherwise remain invisible. This makes SAR a vital tool for both climate research and urban planning.Global benefits of open dataNISAR’s open data policy ensures that its findings will be freely available to scientists, governments, and humanitarian organizations. From tracking crop cycles to forecasting geological hazards, its data will strengthen global food security and disaster preparedness. With the satellite set to revisit Earth every 12 days, decision-makers will gain access to a steady stream of actionable insights, helping build resilience against climate and environmental challenges. Beyond agriculture and disaster management, the mission will also aid in monitoring polar ice loss, deforestation, wetland health, and urban expansion. By providing this wealth of information, NISAR supports evidence-based policy decisions, empowering nations to respond effectively to environmental risks, mitigate climate change impacts, and create sustainable solutions for future generations.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.
