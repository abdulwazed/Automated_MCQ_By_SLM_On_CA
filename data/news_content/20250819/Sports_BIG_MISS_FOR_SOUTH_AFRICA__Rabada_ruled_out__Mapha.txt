AP/PTI(AP08_16_2025_000313A) South Africa's spearhead Kagiso Rabada has been ruled out of the three-match One-Day International series against Australia, starting Tuesday, due to inflammation of his right ankle, Cricket South Africa (CSA) said in a statement."The 30-year-old underwent a scan on Monday, which confirmed the extent of the injury. He will remain in Australia and undergo rehabilitation under the supervision of the Proteas medical staff," CSA said.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Rabada has been replaced by 19-year-old Kwena Maphaka, who was sensational in the recently concluded T20I series.Maphaka picked up nine wickets in three games.The left-arm pacer already has two ODI caps and could be in the starting eleven as South Africa seek to put up a strong challenge against Australia.Brevis, meanwhile, is almost certain to make his ODI debut after a stellar T20I series saw him smash a rollicking 41-ball century in Darwin and follow it up with a blazing half-century in Cairns to finish with 180 runs, making him the top run-scorer across both teams.South Africa’s ODI skipper Temba Bavuma said he had been impressed by Brevis’ form. "It's always exciting when you see the young faces. Obviously, the big talk has been on Brevis, (he's been) putting up his hand and showing what he is capable of. (I'm) excited to see what he can also bring within the one-day stuff," said Bavuma to reporters on Monday.PollWho do you think will have a bigger impact in the ODI series?Kwena MaphakaDewald BrevisTemba BavumaKeshav MaharajThe ODI series also marks Bavuma’s return to competitive cricket after leading South Africa to their maiden ICC World Test Championship crown at Lord’s in June.
