Sarfaraz's performance highlights his determination to regain a spot in the Indian Test team. Sarfaraz Khan (PTI Photo) CHENNAI: When some of his Mumbai teammates and TNCA XI players were waiting for the curtains to come down following a rain interruption towards the end of Monday’s play, Sarfaraz Khan was itching to get back on the field. Sarfaraz, who had retired hurt with cramps after smashing 138 (114 balls, 10x4, 6x6), had his pads on and was craving for more on the opening day of the Buchi Babu invitational red-ball tournament at the Gojan ‘B’ Ground here. Courtesy of his stroke-filled ton and halfcenturies from Suved Parkar (72) and Aakash Parkar (67 not out), Mumbai posted a handsome first-innings score of 367-5 at stumps.

SUBSCRIBE NOW!The hunger that Sarfaraz showed reflected the burning desire which he has to get back to India’s Test set-up. The 27-year-old only warmed the bench during the BorderGavaskar Trophy in Australia and was ignored for the recent tour to England. Playing his first competitive longformat match since turning out for India ‘A’ against England Lions, the right-hander, on Monday, was fully immersed in the task of accumulating runs. So much so that he had to be informed by his teammates after completing his century on the stroke of tea. The Mumbai batter brought up his milestone with a Virender Sehwag-esque upper cut over the wicketkeeper’s head, which resulted in a boundary. Up against a not-so-strong bowling attack, Sarfaraz made TNCA XI pay heavily for their drops. He was handed reprieves – both off left-arm spinner M Siddharth’s bowling – on 15 and 121 before deciding to leave the field with cramps. Sarfaraz was particularly severe on the two slow bowlers, Siddharth (he hit him for 49 runs off 42 balls) and off-spinning allrounder Mohamed Ali (28 off 14 balls), as he treated them with disdain. He used his slog-sweeps to good effect to collect many fours in the square leg-midwicket region while opting to access the ‘V’ when trying to clear the fence. Besides his attractive strokemaking, what caught the eye was his eagerness to run hard between the wickets. He put his speed boots on quite a few times, one of the notable moments being him pinching a single a few minutes before suffering a minor setback. Having a leaner frame, a result of his recent transformation, may have helped him in the cause. Sarfaraz, once overlooked by the national selectors for fitness issues despite amassing loads of runs, shed about 17 kgs in a short time in his bid to once again climb to the top. Sarfaraz’s brother Musheer Khan hailed him for putting on another good show. “My bhai has made it a habit to hit tons. We have a good score and hope to score more in the remaining overs (on Tuesday),” Musheer said in a post-day chat.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
