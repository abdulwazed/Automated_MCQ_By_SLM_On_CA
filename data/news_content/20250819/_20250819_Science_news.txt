NASA and ISRO will monitor this event. The asteroid is large, but poses no threat. Such flybys help scientists refine orbital models. They also help in planetary defense strategies. ISRO plans future missions to study near-Earth asteroids. International collaboration is key for planetary defense.  Asteroids have long fascinated scientists and the public alike, serving as reminders of both the beauty and unpredictability of our universe. These rocky remnants from the solar system’s formation often pass through Earth’s neighborhood, sometimes sparking excitement and curiosity when they come unusually close. While most of these flybys are harmless, they provide valuable opportunities for researchers to study asteroid behavior, refine orbital models, and improve planetary defense systems. NASA, along with other global space agencies, closely monitors such events to ensure Earth’s safety and to expand our understanding of near-Earth objects. One such asteroid making headlines now is 1997 QK1, a massive space rock expected to pass Earth on August 20, 2025, during a safe but significant flyby.NASA confirms asteroid 1997 QK1 will pass Earth on August 20: Size and distanceAsteroid 1997 QK1 was first detected in the late 1990s and has been tracked ever since. It belongs to the Aten group of near-Earth asteroids, named after the Egyptian sun god Aten. These asteroids are unique because their orbits cross Earth’s path around the Sun, making them frequent candidates for close encounters. This asteroid’s large size makes it particularly notable. To put its dimensions into perspective:It is longer than three football fields lined up. If it ever struck Earth, it could cause regional devastation, though not global extinction like the asteroid linked to the dinosaurs’ demise.Fortunately, its trajectory ensures it will remain safely distant during this flyby.On August 20, the asteroid will pass within 1.87 million miles (3 million kilometers) of Earth. While this may sound vast, in astronomical terms it qualifies as a close approach. For comparison:The Moon orbits Earth at about 238,855 miles (384,400 km).This asteroid will pass roughly eight times farther than the Moon’s distance.Though distant in human terms, space agencies classify such encounters as significant because they allow researchers to refine orbital predictions and study asteroid behavior more closely.Why Asteroid 1997 QK1 is not a threatAsteroids are classified as Potentially Hazardous Objects (PHOs) if they meet two conditions:They are larger than 140 meters (460 feet).They come within 4.6 million miles (7.4 million km) of Earth.Asteroid 1997 QK1 meets both criteria, but “potentially hazardous” does not mean “imminently dangerous.” Instead, it signals that its path deserves careful tracking. NASA’s precise calculations confirm that this flyby is safe, with no risk of impact now or in the near future.Why NASA and global space agencies track asteroidsAsteroid monitoring is a cornerstone of planetary defense. Even small changes in an asteroid’s orbit—caused by gravitational nudges from planets or effects like the Yarkovsky effect (when sunlight heats one side of an asteroid, slowly altering its trajectory)—can shift its long-term path.By observing asteroids like 1997 QK1, scientists aim to:Improve orbital models to predict future movements.Assess their composition, density, and spin rate.Explore strategies for deflection missions if a dangerous asteroid is discovered in the future.Notably, NASA’s DART mission (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) in 2022 demonstrated the possibility of altering an asteroid’s orbit by deliberately crashing a spacecraft into it—an important milestone in planetary defense.India’s ISRO plans future missions to study near-Earth asteroidsThe interest in asteroids is not limited to NASA. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has outlined plans for participation in global asteroid studies. According to ISRO Chairman S. Somanath, future missions may include research on larger near-Earth objects, especially as the world prepares for the highly anticipated close approach of asteroid Apophis in 2029.International collaborations involving NASA, ESA (European Space Agency), and JAXA (Japan) are essential, as planetary defense requires shared data and joint strategies. By pooling resources and expertise, space agencies ensure Earth is better prepared for cosmic encounters.Why asteroid 1997 QK1’s flyby is a scientific opportunity for NASA and ISROThe flyby of 1997 QK1 is more than a cosmic spectacle—it is a scientific opportunity. Studying such objects helps researchers uncover:Clues about the solar system’s formation, since asteroids are primitive building blocks of planets.Insights into their structural integrity, important for future resource mining or deflection missions.Better risk assessment models, ensuring preparedness for genuine threats.Although harmless, this event underscores the importance of constant vigilance. The universe is filled with millions of space rocks, and only careful monitoring can separate harmless visitors from those that could alter life on Earth.Also Read | NASA intern Thad Roberts stole $21 million in moon rocks from Johnson Space Center for love; shocked the worldAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Beyond survival and adaptation, the crew discovered an unexpected benefit in PS4 gaming. Video games helped maintain cognitive sharpness, reduce stress, and improve problem-solving skills.  In 2023, NASA conducted a groundbreaking experiment to simulate life on Mars, confining four volunteers in a habitat replica for over a year. The mission, known as CHAPEA (Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog), aimed to study how humans cope with extreme isolation, limited resources, and communication delays. While the scientific focus was on survival, adaptation, and psychological resilience, the crew discovered an unexpected ally: PS4 gaming. Beyond entertainment, video games helped the volunteers maintain cognitive sharpness, reduce stress, and improve problem-solving skills, offering insights for the future of long-duration space missions.How NASA simulates life on MarsThe CHAPEA mission recreated the harsh and confined conditions astronauts would face on a Mars journey. Volunteers lived in a 160-square-meter habitat at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston for 378 days. The experiment tested not only physical endurance, like managing food supplies and simulated spacewalks, but also the emotional and mental resilience of a crew cut off from the outside world. With Mars missions expected to last up to two years, understanding isolation’s impact on teamwork, decision-making, and morale is critical for preparing astronauts for interplanetary travel.Video games as a mental health tool During the mission, PS4 gaming became a central way for the crew to cope with monotony and stress. Strategy and simulation games like SimCity, Civilization, and Factorio challenged the participants to plan, manage resources, and solve complex problems, skills directly relevant to space travel. Microbiologist Anca Selariu noted that gaming sessions offered cognitive training while providing a mental escape, keeping the crew’s minds active and morale high. NASA researchers now see gaming as a potential standard tool for future long-duration missions. This experiment suggests that future astronauts could benefit from custom-designed video games tailored for space missions.Coping with isolation and psychological challenges The volunteers experienced strict isolation, with communication to NASA delayed by 22 minutes each way. Living without natural light in a small habitat tested their mental endurance. Video games played a vital role in maintaining mental health, helping reduce feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and stress. They also encouraged teamwork, strategic thinking, and problem-solving under pressure, essential skills for astronauts on real interplanetary missions. The CHAPEA mission demonstrates that structured entertainment can complement physical and psychological training for future explorers.Lessons for future Mars missions NASA’s Mars simulation experiment highlights the importance of addressing psychological needs during long-duration spaceflight. Incorporating video games and other interactive entertainment may improve astronauts’ cognitive function, morale, and overall mission success. By combining rigorous scientific research with practical coping strategies, missions like CHAPEA pave the way for safer, more effective human exploration of Mars and beyond.

He was greeted by ministers, ISRO chairman, and space enthusiasts. Shukla is scheduled to meet PM Modi and participate in National Space Day celebrations, with Parliament set to discuss his mission and India's space program. Astronaut Subhanshu Shukla, along with astronaut Prashant Balakrishnan Nair, receives grand welcome from Union space minister Jitendra Singh, Delhi CM Rekha Gupta and and Isro chairman V Narayanan at the Delhi airport NEW DELHI: Following his historic mission to the International Space Station (ISS), Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla received a red-carpet welcome at Delhi’s IGI airport as he returned to the country from the US in the early hours of Sunday. Shukla, who piloted the spacecraft to the space station as part of the Axiom-4 mission, was welcomed by Union space minister Jitendra Singh, Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta and Isro chairman V Narayanan, and a large crowd of space enthusiasts at the airport.Posting on X later, minister Jitendra Singh said, “A moment of pride for India! A moment of glory for #ISRO! A moment of gratitude to the dispensation that facilitated this under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. India’s Space glory touches the Indian soil… as the iconic son of Mother India, Gaganyatri Shubhanshu Shukla lands at Delhi in the early hours of morning today. Accompanying him, another equally accomplished Group Captain Prasanth Balakrishnan Nair, one of the astronauts selected for India’s first Human mission Gaganyaan who was India’s designated backup for the mission to the ISS. Privileged to receive both of them”.Shukla is expected to meet PM Modi and then travel to his hometown Lucknow. He is likely to return to the Capital on Aug 22–23 to participate in the National Space Day celebrations.PollShould the Indian government invest more in space exploration?DefinitelyNo, we need to focus on other issuesThe Lok Sabha will hold a special discussion on Monday on India's space journey and Shukla's historic mission aboard the ISS, according to a notice issued by the lower House. The House will discuss “India's first astronaut aboard the ISS — critical role of space programme for Viksit Bharat by 2047”, which could possibly end the deadlock between the govt and opposition in Parliament over the electoral roll revision in Bihar.Earlier on Saturday, Shukla had posted a smiling photograph of himself on a flight and said he was filled with emotions. “As I sit on the plane to come back to India, I have a mix of emotions running through my heart. I feel sad leaving a fantastic group of people behind who were my friends and family for the past one year during this mission. I am also excited about meeting all my friends, family, and everyone in the country for the first time post mission. I guess this is what life is -- everything all at once," he said.In the 79th Independence Day speech at the Red Fort on Friday, PM Modi, while mentioning Group Captain Shukla’s successful mission to ISS, had said that India is working towards becoming self-reliant in the space sector and preparing for the launch of Gaganyaan, its indigenous human space flight mission, and is also working on developing its own space station.In June, Shukla became the second Indian to go to space — after IAF wing commander Rakesh Sharma in 1984— as part of the Axiom-4 mission to the ISS. During the 18-day mission, Shukla, along with astronauts Peggy Whitson (US), Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski (Poland), and Tibor Kapu (Hungary), conducted more than 60 experiments and 20 outreach sessions aboard the ISS. He returned to the Earth on July 16.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous8 best anti-ageing ingredients you should start using in your 20sLifestyle10 best vegetarian sources of IronLifestyleSalwar tales by gorgeous lady Shabana ShajahantvCars under Rs 6 lakh with six airbags: Maruti Alto, Nissan Magnite and moreautoKundali Bhagya fame Shraddha Arya’s stunning ethnic lookstvAnupama Parameswaran shines bright in striking snapsEntertainment'Coolie' actress Reba Monica John’s picture-perfect momentsEntertainmentMalavika Mohanan's stunning style moments you can't missEntertainmentJannat Zubair’s Gen-Z Style is Pure PerfectiontvEver heard of Flying fish?

Orbiting 460 miles above Earth, it will capture high-resolution radar images, penetrating clouds and darkness. This breakthrough will provide critical data on climate change, natural hazards, and agricultural trends, offering global benefits through open data access.  In a landmark achievement for global space cooperation, NASA and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) have successfully deployed the world’s largest radar antenna in orbit. The 33-foot antenna, part of the joint NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission, is designed to capture Earth’s surface in unprecedented detail. Orbiting about 460 miles above the planet, the mission will provide high-resolution radar images that can penetrate clouds and operate both day and night. This breakthrough will empower scientists, policymakers, and disaster-response teams worldwide by offering critical data on climate change, natural hazards, and agricultural trends. The milestone marks a new era in Earth observation, combining advanced engineering with international collaboration.NASA, ISRO, and NISAR: Redefining Earth observationThe NISAR satellite, jointly managed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and ISRO, is equipped with dual-frequency L- and S-band synthetic aperture radar. This system allows it to track Earth’s surface changes with remarkable precision. Unlike optical satellites limited by weather or lighting conditions, NISAR provides continuous, reliable data, making it a game-changer for monitoring glaciers, forests, seismic activity, and farmlands. NASA emphasizes that this technology will revolutionize how nations prepare for disasters and manage resources.The 33-foot antenna, the largest ever used in a NASA Earth science mission, was built by Astro Aerospace, a Northrop Grumman company. Compact at launch, it expanded in orbit into its full umbrella-like shape. Engineers designed it to survive the extreme pressures of launch, the vacuum of space, and constant rotation at 4.5 revolutions per minute. This massive aperture is crucial for generating sharp radar images that will enable groundbreaking scientific studies.Synthetic aperture radar: Seeing the unseenSynthetic aperture radar (SAR) works like a powerful camera lens, simulating a larger antenna to produce high-resolution images. Using interferometric techniques, NISAR can compare radar images over time, creating 3D models of surface changes. These models can reveal subtle shifts such as slow land subsidence, early signs of landslides, or glacier retreat that would otherwise remain invisible. This makes SAR a vital tool for both climate research and urban planning.Global benefits of open dataNISAR’s open data policy ensures that its findings will be freely available to scientists, governments, and humanitarian organizations. From tracking crop cycles to forecasting geological hazards, its data will strengthen global food security and disaster preparedness. With the satellite set to revisit Earth every 12 days, decision-makers will gain access to a steady stream of actionable insights, helping build resilience against climate and environmental challenges. Beyond agriculture and disaster management, the mission will also aid in monitoring polar ice loss, deforestation, wetland health, and urban expansion. By providing this wealth of information, NISAR supports evidence-based policy decisions, empowering nations to respond effectively to environmental risks, mitigate climate change impacts, and create sustainable solutions for future generations.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

This Oligocene-era predator, unlike modern baleen whales, possessed sharp teeth and large eyes, indicating an active hunting lifestyle. The remarkably preserved fossil offers crucial insights into whale evolution, particularly the transition from toothed predators to filter feeders.  In a groundbreaking discovery, scientists from Monash University and Museums Victoria have unearthed a 26-million-year-old whale skull at Jan Juc Beach in Victoria, Australia. The fossil belongs to a newly identified species, Janjucetus dullardi, a small but fierce predator from the Oligocene epoch. According to the research published on Tuesday, August 12, 2025 in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, the whale specimen (Janjucetus dullardi) represents a juvenile or subadult individual, estimated to be about 7 feet (2.1 meters) in length. Unlike modern baleen whales that filter-feed, Janjucetus had sharp teeth and large eyes, indicating it actively hunted prey like fish and squid.The fossil is exceptionally well-preserved, including the skull, ear bones, and teeth, rare features that offer vital insights into whale evolution. This species represents a key stage between land-dwelling ancestors and fully aquatic whales, helping scientists understand how early whales adapted to life in the ocean. The discovery not only sheds light on the evolutionary shift from toothed predators to filter feeders, but also provides a rare glimpse into ancient marine ecosystems. It highlights southern Australia’s importance in understanding the rich history of life in prehistoric oceans.How the whale skull fossil was discoveredScientists have revealed a 26-million-year-old whale skull fossil found in 2019 by fossil enthusiast Ross Dullard at Jan Juc Beach, Victoria, Australia. The fossil, embedded in ancient marine sediments, belongs to a newly identified species named Janjucetus dullardi, a small but fierce predator from the Oligocene epoch. Unlike modern baleen whales that filter-feed, Janjucetus had sharp teeth and large eyes, indicating it actively hunted prey such as fish and squid. Measuring just 2–3 meters in length, it was much smaller than today’s whales but well-adapted for predation in the warm, subtropical seas of its time.The fossil’s exceptional preservation, including parts of the skull, teeth, and ear bones, offers paleontologists an unprecedented look into early whale anatomy. Detailed examination of its jaw structure, sensory organs, and hearing system provides valuable insight into the evolutionary transition from land-dwelling mammals to fully aquatic whales. This discovery significantly advances our understanding of whale evolution and ancient marine ecosystems.What the whale skull fossil reveals about anatomyIn a groundbreaking discovery, scientists have unveiled a 26-million-year-old whale skull fossil, found in 2019 by fossil enthusiast Ross Dullard at Jan Juc Beach in Victoria, Australia. The fossil belongs to a newly identified species, Janjucetus dullardi, a small but powerful predator from the Oligocene epoch. Unlike modern baleen whales, Janjucetus had large forward-facing eyes, indicating sharp vision for hunting, and a jaw lined with sharp teeth suited for catching fish and other marine animals. Measuring 2–3 meters in length, it was much smaller than today’s whales but well-adapted for life as an agile marine hunter. Exceptionally preserved, the fossil includes parts of the skull, teeth, and ear bones. These features reveal early hearing adaptations, helping researchers understand how ancient whales detected prey underwater. By studying this skull, scientists gain rare insight into the evolutionary shift from active predation to filter feeding, and into the behavior, anatomy, and ecology of early whales in prehistoric oceans.Why this whale skull fossil matters for evolutionThe whale skull fossil of Janjucetus dullardi is key to understanding early whale evolution. As part of the mammalodontid lineage, this species illustrates the diversity of feeding strategies in ancient oceans. The fossil shows how whales adapted from land mammals to aquatic predators with specialized hunting features. Examining the whale skull helps researchers trace evolutionary steps toward modern whales, highlighting the shift from active predation to filter feeding. Fossils like this illuminate the ecological pressures that shaped marine life millions of years ago.The broader importance of fossil whale skullsDiscoveries like this fossil whale skull highlight the value of fossils in studying life’s history. Whale skulls are rarely preserved due to oceanic erosion, making this find exceptionally significant. Fossils allow scientists to analyze skull morphology, sensory adaptations, and feeding strategies in detail. By studying ancient whale fossils, researchers can better understand how whales responded to environmental changes over millions of years and trace the evolutionary lineage of today’s marine giants.The 26-million-year-old whale skull fossil of Janjucetus dullardi is a milestone in paleontology. Its well-preserved skull, teeth, and ear bones provide a window into the life of ancient predatory whales and their adaptations. Studying this fossil enhances our understanding of early whales, their hunting behaviors, and their ecological roles. Ongoing research into fossils like this continues to illuminate the complex history of marine life and the evolutionary path that led to the majestic whales we see in our oceans today.Also read| Toothpaste made from hair: A sustainable innovation to repair teeth naturallyAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Researchers successfully translated imagined words into text using brain implants and AI. The study, part of the BrainGate2 trial, demonstrated that brain signals for imagined speech are similar to those for attempted speech.  For decades, neuro-engineers have dreamed of helping people who have been cut off from the world of language. A disease like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, weakens the muscles in the airway. A stroke can kill neurons that normally relay commands for speaking. Perhaps, by implanting electrodes, scientists could record the brain's electric activity and translate that into spoken words.Now a team of researchers has made an important advance toward that goal. Previously they succeeded in decoding the signals produced when people tried to speak. In the new study, published Thursday in the journal Cell, their computer often made correct guesses when the subjects simply imagined saying words.Christian Herff, a neuroscientist at Maastricht University in the Netherlands who was not involved in the research, said the result went beyond the merely technological and shed light on the mystery of language. "It's a fantastic advance," Herff said. The new study is the latest result in a long-running clinical trial, called BrainGate2, that has already seen some remarkable successes.One participant, Casey Harrell, now uses his brain-machine interface to hold conversations. In 2023, after ALS had made his voice unintelligible, Harrell agreed to have electrodes implanted in his brain. A computer recorded the electrical activity from the implants as Harrell attempted to say different words. Over time, with the help of AI, the computer predicted 6,000 words, with 97.5% accuracy.But successes like this raised a troubling question: Could a computer accidentally record more than patients actually wanted to say?Could it eavesdrop on their inner voice? "We wanted to investigate if there was a risk of the system decoding words that weren't meant to be said aloud," said Erin Kunz, a neuroscientist at Stanford University and an author of the study. She and her colleagues also wondered if patients might actually prefer using inner speech.Kunz and her colleagues decided to investigate the mystery for themselves. The scientists gave participants seven different words, including "kite" and "day," then compared the brain signals when participants attempted to say the words and when they only imagined saying them.As it turned out, imagining a word produced a pattern of activity similar to that of trying to say it, but the signal was weaker. The computer did a good job of predicting which of the seven words the participants were thinking. For Harrell, it didn't do much better than a random guess would have, but for another participant it picked the right word more than 70% of the time.The researchers put the computer through more training, this time specifically on inner speech. Its performance improved significantly, including on Harrell. Now when the participants imagined saying entire sentences, such as "I don't know how long you've been here," the computer could accurately decode most of the words.Herff, who has done his own studies, was surprised that the experiment succeeded. Before, he would have said that inner speech is fundamentally different from the motor cortex signals that produce actual speech. "But in this study, they show that, for some people, it isn't that different," he said.Kunz emphasized that the computer's current performance involving inner speech would not be good enough to let people hold conversations. "The results are an initial proof of concept more than anything," she said. But she is optimistic that decoding inner speech could become the new standard for brain-computer interfaces. In recent trials, she and her colleagues have improved the computer's accuracy. "We haven't hit the ceiling yet," she said.

A chance find on an Australian beach has revealed a rare, entirely new species, Janjucetus dullardi, that could unlock new clues about whale evolution.The 25-million-year-old juvenile specimen, small enough to fit in a single bed, was identified in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. It had bulging, tennis-ball-sized eyes, a shark-like snout, and sharp teeth designed for hunting. “It was, let’s say, deceptively cute,” said Erich Fitzgerald, senior curator of vertebrate paleontology at Museums Victoria. “It might have looked like some weird mash-up between a whale, a seal and a Pokémon, but they were very much their own thing.”The partial skull, including ear bones and teeth, was found in 2019 along Victoria’s Jan Juc Beach, a site known for unusual whale fossils. Janjucetus dullardi is only the fourth species ever identified in the mammalodontid group, early whales that lived during the Oligocene Epoch, about 34–23 million years ago. These predators, around three metres long, were an early branch of the lineage that led to modern baleen whales, but looked radically different. “They may have had tiny little nubbins of legs just projecting as stumps,” Fitzgerald said, a mystery that will remain unless a more complete skeleton is found.The species name honours Ross Dullard, the amateur fossil hunter who spotted something black protruding from a cliff during a low-tide search. When he poked it, a tooth fell out. “I thought, geez, we’ve got something special here,” he said. Museums Victoria confirmed this week it was a new species. Dullard, a school principal, said the news was “the greatest 24 hours of my life,” describing rock-star treatment at work with “high fives coming left, right and centre.”This is the first mammalodontid found in Australia since 2006 and only the third in the country. Whale fossils of this quality are rare because most skeletons are lost to erosion, scavengers, and currents over millions of years. “It’s only the chosen few… that actually get preserved as fossils,” Fitzgerald noted.Researchers say Janjucetus dullardi could help reveal how early whales fed, moved, and adapted to ancient warm oceans, insights that could inform how modern marine life responds to climate change. Dullard plans to mark the occasion with a “fossil party” featuring cetacean-themed games and whale-shaped jello, to celebrate his nightmare Muppet find. “I’ve had sleepless nights,” he admitted. “I’ve dreamt about this whale.”About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Researchers used diamond anvil cells and X-ray diffraction to observe mineral behavior under extreme conditions, explaining seismic wave anomalies and linking deep mantle processes to plate tectonics, volcanism, and Earth's magnetic field. Something ‘big’ is moving inside Earth; here’s what scientists just found For decades, scientists have sought to unravel the mysteries hidden deep beneath Earth’s surface. One of the most puzzling regions has been the D" layer, located about 2,700 kilometres (1,700 miles) beneath the surface, at the boundary between the planet’s lower mantle and outer core. This zone has long been known for its unusual seismic properties, which have sparked debates about its composition and behaviour.Now, a groundbreaking study conducted by researchers at ETH Zurich has revealed that solid rock in this deep layer of Earth’s mantle can move like a fluid, while still maintaining its solid state. Led by Professor Motohiko Murakami, the research team has provided experimental evidence explaining how minerals in the D" layer align and deform over geological timescales. The findings, published in Communications Earth & Environment, shed new light on mantle convection, plate tectonics, volcanic activity, and even the generation of Earth’s magnetic field.Earth’s hidden D" layer finally comes into focusThe D" layer sits just above the outer core and plays a key role in the planet’s internal dynamics. It has been a focal point for geoscientists because seismic waves passing through it behave differently than expected, often travelling faster in some regions and slower in others. Understanding the cause of these variations has been a challenge, as conditions in this layer involve extreme pressures and temperatures that are difficult to replicate in laboratory experiments.To study the D" layer, Murakami’s team used diamond anvil cells—devices capable of generating pressures exceeding those found deep within Earth—and X-ray diffraction techniques to examine the atomic structure of minerals under such conditions.The researchers recreated the high-pressure, high-temperature environment of the D" layer and observed how minerals behaved. They used magnesium germanate crystals as an experimental analogue for mantle minerals because they exhibit similar structural properties but are easier to work with in the lab.Role of post-perovskite in mantle dynamicsThe study focused on post-perovskite, a high-pressure phase of the mineral perovskite that forms under the extreme conditions of the D" layer. Post-perovskite has unique structural properties that allow its crystals to align in specific patterns when subjected to geological stress over long periods.This alignment enables solid-state flow, a process in which solid rock deforms and moves like a viscous fluid without melting. Such movement plays a critical role in mantle convection—the slow circulation of rock that drives the movement of tectonic plates at Earth’s surface.Explaining seismic wave anomaliesOne of the major outcomes of the research is the explanation for why seismic waves can accelerate by up to seven percent when passing through certain regions of the D" layer. The alignment of post-perovskite crystals changes the way seismic energy travels through the rock, matching patterns observed in global seismological data.This discovery effectively resolves a long-standing puzzle in geophysics and provides a clear link between deep mantle mineral behaviour and surface-level seismic measurements.Impact on plate tectonics and volcanismThe movement of solid rock in the D" layer has significant implications for plate tectonics. Mantle plumes—columns of hot rock rising from deep within the Earth—can be guided by the alignment of post-perovskite minerals, directing heat and material toward the upper mantle and crust.These processes are responsible for creating volcanic hotspots such as those in Hawaii and Iceland. The study also helps explain how deep mantle processes influence the formation of mountain ranges and the activity along subduction zones where one tectonic plate slides beneath another.Connection to Earth’s magnetic fieldBeyond plate tectonics, the findings have important implications for understanding the geodynamo—the mechanism that generates Earth’s magnetic field. The distribution of heat from the deep mantle to the outer core affects convection within the liquid iron core, which in turn influences magnetic field generation.By showing how the D" layer channels heat through solid-state flow, the study reveals a previously underappreciated link between deep mantle processes and the stability and variations of Earth’s magnetic field over the past 200 million years. This breakthrough opens new pathways for future research into how Earth’s deep interior continues to shape the planet’s surface and long-term habitability.Methodology and experimental insightsMurakami’s team achieved their results by:Using diamond anvil cells to create pressures of hundreds of gigapascals, similar to those at the core-mantle boundary.Applying high-temperature lasers to simulate the intense heat found deep underground.Analysing the crystal structures with synchrotron X-ray diffraction to observe how minerals deform under such conditions.Studying magnesium germanate as a stand-in for mantle perovskite allows the researchers to observe mineral alignment and flow properties.Significance for Earth scienceThe discovery that solid rock can behave like a fluid deep within the Earth provides:A more complete model of mantle convection and its effects on surface geology.An explanation for seismic anomalies detected in the D" layer.New insights into the heat flow between Earth’s core and mantle.A better understanding of how mantle plumes form and influence volcanism.A link between deep Earth processes and magnetic field generation.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

NASA captured 10 mysterious dark voids over remote island near Antarctica: What they reveal about the bizarre natural phenomena
In May 2016, NASA satellites detected ten unusual dark voids within cloud cover above Heard Island, a remote volcanic landmass. These formations, linked to von Kármán vortices, exhibited an atypical darkness, tight spiral structure, and a sharp directional change. This rare event provides scientists with a unique opportunity to study small-island wind effects and their impact on atmospheric patterns.

These formations, linked to von Kármán vortices, exhibited an atypical darkness, tight spiral structure, and a sharp directional change. This rare event provides scientists with a unique opportunity to study small-island wind effects and their impact on atmospheric patterns.  NASA satellites have captured a rare and eerie sight: 10 swirling “dark voids” puncturing thick cloud cover above Heard Island, an isolated volcanic landmass in the southern Indian Ocean, around 900 miles (1,500 km) north of Antarctica. The black patches, each averaging 8 miles (13 km) wide, formed in May 2016 and appear as part of an unusual atmospheric pattern. While these formations are linked to von Karman vortices, swirling air currents formed when wind passes around a tall obstacle, scientists note their unusual darkness, tight spiral structure, and dramatic change in direction make this event exceptional.The 10 dark voids show isolation’s impact on rare weatherThe 10 massive dark voids, captured in May 2016, are a striking example of how Heard Island’s extreme environment fuels rare atmospheric phenomena. This uninhabited Australian territory lies in one of the most remote and storm-battered regions on Earth, within the “Furious Fifties,” where powerful westerly winds dominate. Towering above the island is Mawson Peak, a 9,000-foot (2,700-meter) active volcano that disrupts airflow and cloud formations. The combination of volcanic terrain, fierce winds, and the island’s isolation provides perfect conditions for unusual cloud patterns, but seeing them so distinctly in satellite imagery is extraordinarily rare.Von Karman vortices: Nature’s swirling wind patternsVon Karman vortices form when fast-moving winds encounter an obstacle, such as an island or mountain, disrupting airflow and creating alternating spinning eddies on either side. These patterns are named after physicist Theodore von Karman, who first described the phenomenon. While von Karman vortices are occasionally observed in other regions of the world, such as the Canary Islands or Guadalupe Island, they usually appear as long, wispy trails of clouds. The vortices over Heard Island were instead marked by dense, perfectly circular gaps in the clouds, making this event stand out from typical occurrences.Unusual shape and sharp bend make it uniqueMost von Karman vortex streams appear smooth and aligned, flowing in a consistent direction. In contrast, the May 2016 formation over Heard Island bent sharply by nearly 90 degrees midstream, an abrupt shift likely triggered by intense westerly winds exceeding 50 mph (80 km/h). Additionally, the presence of thick clouds meant that only the vortex cores were visible, creating the illusion of black voids in the sky. This combination of strong winds, sudden directional change, and isolated visibility of the vortex centers is rarely seen in satellite imagery. Such extraordinary formations provide scientists with valuable insights into extreme weather behavior in isolated regions.A rare chance to study small-island wind effectsBecause Mawson Peak is smaller than most peaks that generate von Karman vortices, such patterns in this location are uncommon. This event offered researchers a rare opportunity to analyze how atmospheric flows interact with smaller volcanic landmasses. Studying these effects can improve understanding of how wind patterns influence global weather systems, climate, and even the transport of airborne particles across oceans. The Heard Island vortices also highlight how relatively minor topographic features can cause significant disturbances in large-scale airflow under the right conditions.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

(Photo: X) NEW DELHI: In a landmark achievement, India has successfully sent its aquanauts to depths of over 5,000 metres in the North Atlantic Ocean.The mission marked a major step towards the country’s Deep Ocean Mission, also known as Samudrayaan. The feat comes just weeks after Shubhanshu Shukla became the first Indian to reach the International Space Station.Historic Moment: Shubhanshu Shukla Touches Down Earth With Spashdown Off U.S. Coast | Axiom-4The expedition was carried out in collaboration with France and involved two Indian aquanauts who completed separate deep dives in the French submersible Nautile earlier this month.PollWhich achievement do you think is more significant for India's scientific progress?Diving over 5,000 metres in the oceanReaching the International Space StationOn 5 August, Raju Ramesh, a scientist at the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), descended 4,025 metres. A record-setting 5,002-metre dive by retired Navy Commander Jatinder Pal Singh the next day followed this.Union Earth Sciences Minister Jitendra Singh said, "We have an Indian going into space and an Indian going into the deep ocean almost simultaneously." He called it part of India’s “double conquest” in underexplored frontiers, which he believes will contribute to the country’s economic growth.The minister added that PM Narendra Modi has shown a strong interest in the Deep Ocean Mission and blue economy.The Deep Ocean Mission, cleared by the Union Cabinet in 2021, covers crewed and uncrewed submersibles, deep-sea mining technology, biodiversity research and ocean-based energy projects. It aims to explore and utilise resources within India’s Exclusive Economic Zone and continental shelf.Matsya 6000M Ravichandran, Secretary in the ministry of Earth sciences, said the Deep Ocean Mission was carried out to gain firsthand experience before India tries the same with its own submersible, Matsya 6000. "One of the verticals of the DOM aims to develop technology to harness non-living ocean resources and a submersible which can carry humans to the deepest parts of the ocean for exploration," he said.The Matsya 6000, likely to be ready by December 2027, will carry three people to depths of 6,000 metres inside a titanium alloy sphere.

The photograph highlights vegetation health, water distribution, and land use, aiding scientists in monitoring environmental changes. This image underscores the delta's significance as a biodiversity hotspot and its vital role in environmental stability. Source: X NASA astronaut Don Pettit has shared a striking near-infrared image of the Ganga River delta on X (formerly Twitter), captured during his Expedition 73 mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Posted on social media, the image provides a rare, high-contrast perspective of the world’s largest river delta, showcasing the vast, fertile landscapes across eastern India and Bangladesh. The photograph highlights the power of space-based observation in understanding Earth’s geography and the delicate ecosystems that sustain millions of people in the region.NASA astronaut captures Ganga river delta: Near-infrared photography reveals hidden ecosystem featuresPettit captured the delta using near-infrared photography, a technique that highlights features invisible to the human eye. Healthy vegetation appears luminous, while rivers, marshes, and agricultural land stand out with remarkable clarity. Scientists use these images to monitor plant health, water distribution, and environmental changes over time. By revealing fine details of the landscape, near-infrared photography allows researchers to track the effects of climate change, urbanisation, and deforestation, providing crucial data to protect this vital ecosystem.Accompanying the image, Pettit described the region as “the largest river delta on Earth,” underscoring both its geographical significance and natural splendour. The photograph quickly drew admiration from scientists, nature lovers, and photography enthusiasts alike and was praised for blending technical precision with artistic expression.Beyond its scientific value, Pettit’s photograph has captured attention for its visual appeal. The glowing greenery, winding rivers, and patchwork of farmland create a composition that blends art and science seamlessly. Social media users and science communities alike have praised the image, noting both its technical precision and aesthetic beauty. Pettit’s work highlights how space photography can inspire curiosity and appreciation for Earth’s landscapes, offering a perspective rarely seen from the ground.The Ganga-Brahmaputra delta: Asia’s largest river delta and vital biodiversity hotspotThe Ganga or Ganges delta, also called the Bengal Delta or Sundarbans Delta, covers more than 100,000 square kilometres and flows into the Bay of Bengal. It is home to millions who depend on its rich soils for agriculture, and it contains the UNESCO-listed Sundarbans mangrove forest. This unique ecosystem provides a habitat for endangered species like the Bengal tiger and supports biodiversity through its dense forests and interwoven waterways. Seasonal flooding replenishes nutrients in the soil, creating highly productive farmland, but also poses challenges for communities living in the delta.The Ganga river delta: Vital ecosystem and environmental stabilityThe Ganga river delta is not only vital for human livelihoods but also plays a crucial role in environmental stability. Its wetlands act as natural buffers against floods, while mangroves prevent coastal erosion and storm damage. These tools also assist in assessing biodiversity, identifying areas of habitat loss, and planning sustainable conservation efforts to protect both wildlife and local communities. Satellite and aerial imagery help scientists monitor these ecosystems, track seasonal flooding, and study the impact of climate change. Pettit’s near-infrared photograph contributes to this research by providing a detailed view of vegetation and land use, complementing other scientific tools used to safeguard the delta’s delicate balance.NASA astronaut Don Pettit’s near-infrared images of the Ganga river delta provide a striking perspective on one of the world’s most vital and expansive ecosystems. Covering over 100,000 square kilometres, the delta sustains millions of people, supports rich biodiversity, and safeguards coastal regions from natural disasters. Pettit’s work combines scientific observation with artistic vision, emphasising the importance of monitoring waterways, vegetation, and ecological health from space. Such imagery not only showcases the beauty and fragility of our planet but also inspires greater environmental awareness, highlighting the urgent need for conservation and fostering a deeper global appreciation of Earth’s natural landscapes.Also Read: NASA and Google collaborating together to develop AI medical assistant to boost astronaut health on Moon and Mars missionsAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

He was aided by Tiffany Fowler and Shae Saur. The stolen rocks were valued at $21 million. Roberts claimed it was for love, but the FBI found he planned to sell them. Roberts and his accomplices were arrested. The heist damaged scientific research. Source: LADbible In one of the most audacious and bizarre crimes in NASA history, Thad Roberts, a 24-year-old intern, stole moon rocks valued at $21 million in 2002, driven by romance rather than greed. Alongside his girlfriend Tiffany Fowler and fellow intern Shae Saur, Roberts executed a meticulously planned burglary at Houston’s Johnson Space Center, using authentic NASA badges, rewired security cameras, and Neoprene suits to bypass alarms. Their theft of 17 pounds of lunar samples included historic moon rocks from Apollo missions 1969–1972. While Roberts claimed the act was “for love,” the FBI revealed he had attempted to sell the rocks secretly online. This extraordinary heist destroyed priceless scientific research, embarrassed NASA, and shocked the world, blending science, crime, and obsession in an unforgettable story.$21 million moon rock theft at Johnson Space Center shocks scientists worldwideOn a July night in 2002, Roberts, Fowler, and Saur infiltrated Building 31 at Johnson Space Center. Roberts and Fowler donned Neoprene bodysuits, which allowed them to bypass thermal alarms, while Saur acted as a lookout. Using a power saw, they cracked open a 601-pound safe containing moon rocks and meteorites, including samples from every Apollo mission, many of which were irreplaceable and scientifically invaluable. The stolen lunar samples were worth approximately $21 million and represented decades of scientific research, experimentation, and NASA missions. The planning and execution demonstrated not only audacity but also technical sophistication, showing how a combination of insider knowledge, meticulous preparation, and determination can circumvent the most secure facilities. Source: Live ScienceWho is Thad Roberts? From NASA Intern to mastermind behind the $21 million moon rock theftThad Roberts graduated from the University of Utah with a triple degree in physics, geology, and geophysics, making him highly qualified to work at NASA. He met Tiffany Fowler, a 22-year-old stem cell researcher, and the couple quickly became romantically involved. Roberts reportedly told Fowler he wanted to “give her the moon,” framing the theft as a grand romantic gesture. According to People.com , the FBI considered financial motives, Roberts maintained that the act symbolized devotion rather than profit.Moon rock theft ends with FBI arrests and millions in NASA lunar samples lostRoberts and Fowler’s motivation went beyond romance—they symbolically “had sex on the moon” by placing stolen lunar samples under a blanket during intimate moments. Roberts later stated, “No one had ever had sex on the moon before,” underscoring the bizarre, almost surreal nature of the crime. While Roberts claimed love was the driving factor, the FBI discovered he had negotiated with a Belgian buyer willing to pay up to $5,000 per gram, proving the theft had financial implications.The heist came to a dramatic end when Roberts and Fowler traveled to Orlando to meet the potential buyer, only to be apprehended by undercover FBI agents. Saur and Gordon McWhorter, who helped arrange the sale, were arrested shortly afterward. The investigation revealed that the theft had caused irreversible damage: the moon rocks were now “virtually useless to the scientific community,” and three decades of NASA research notes were destroyed as reported.Moon rock theft from NASA leads to jail, house arrest, and finesThad Roberts pleaded guilty to the theft of moon rocks and other NASA artifacts, serving over six years of an eight-year prison sentence before his release in 2008. Tiffany Fowler and Shae Saur received house arrest, community service, and were required to pay restitution to NASA. Gordon McWhorter was convicted at trial for his involvement in the theft and sentenced to six years in prison. The case highlighted serious security breaches and led to stricter controls on NASA’s valuable collections.Also Read | NASA and Google collaborating together to boost astronaut health on Moon and Mars missionsAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Bermuda Triangle ‘mystery’ solved? Scientist explains the real cause behind vanishings of ships and planes
The Bermuda Triangle's infamous reputation for unexplained disappearances is largely unfounded, according to scientist Karl Kruszelnicki and supported by NOAA and Lloyd's of London. The region's high traffic volume, combined with challenging environmental conditions like the Gulf Stream and frequent storms, accounts for the incidents. Human error and equipment failure also play significant roles, debunking myths of supernatural forces.

The region's high traffic volume, combined with challenging environmental conditions like the Gulf Stream and frequent storms, accounts for the incidents. Human error and equipment failure also play significant roles, debunking myths of supernatural forces. Image: Getty Images  For decades, the Bermuda Triangle, the stretch of ocean roughly bounded by Miami, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico, has been the subject of mystery, fear, and speculation. From tales of ships vanishing without a trace to aircraft disappearing mid-flight, the region has inspired theories about supernatural forces, alien abductions, and even time warps. But according to Australian scientist Karl Kruszelnicki, backed by research from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Lloyd’s of London, these myths do not hold up. Far from being a cursed zone, the Bermuda Triangle’s so-called mysteries can be explained by natural environmental conditions, human error, and statistical probability. The truth, Kruszelnicki emphasizes, is far less otherworldly and far more rooted in the realities of nature and navigation.Bermuda Triangle poses no greater risk than other oceansKruszelnicki, supported by NOAA and Lloyd’s of London, has long maintained that the Bermuda Triangle is no more dangerous than any other ocean region. Disappearances occur at roughly the same proportional rate as elsewhere in the world’s waters. As noted by Kruszelnicki, the higher number of incidents is largely due to the Triangle being one of the busiest shipping and flight corridors in the world, where heavy traffic naturally means more recorded accidents. Statistical data confirms that when the volume of vessels and aircraft is taken into account, the accident rate is completely ordinary. This directly challenges the very foundation of the Triangle’s mythical reputation.Environmental and navigational challenges of 'Bermuda Triangle'According to Kruszelnicki, the geography and weather patterns of the Bermuda Triangle create conditions that can challenge even experienced navigators. The Gulf Stream, a powerful ocean current, can cause sudden changes in weather, generate violent storms, and push vessels off course within minutes. The region is also prone to tropical storms, hurricanes, waterspouts, and rogue waves that can overwhelm ships and planes without warning. Numerous islands and coral reefs make for hazardous, shallow navigation routes, increasing the risk of grounding or collision. Kruszelnicki also points out that certain areas experience magnetic anomalies where compasses may point to true north instead of magnetic north, leading to potential navigation errors. Furthermore, unpredictable microbursts and rapidly forming squalls can make navigation extremely hazardous, even for experienced crews. Sudden changes in visibility and wind patterns have historically contributed to numerous near-miss incidents in the area. When all these factors combine, even a minor miscalculation can turn deadly.Human error and equipment failureAs Kruszelnicki explains, a significant number of accidents in the Bermuda Triangle can be traced to pilot or captain mistakes, faulty equipment, or outdated forecasting methods. These human and technical shortcomings often occur alongside the already challenging weather and navigational conditions of the region. In earlier decades, limited communication systems and slower emergency response times meant that vessels or aircraft in trouble had little chance of rescue. Even today, with advanced technology, mistakes and malfunctions can quickly escalate into disasters when compounded by sudden storms or rough seas. Kruszelnicki stresses that the human factor is often underestimated in popular explanations of the Triangle’s incidents.Origins of the myth of the Bermuda Triangle The term “Bermuda Triangle” was first coined in 1963 by writer Vincent Gaddis, who linked the region to a series of unexplained disappearances. His writings sparked public curiosity, but the myth gained massive momentum in 1974 when author Charles Berlitz published a bestselling book that embellished these stories with speculation about Atlantis, alien abductions, and other sensational claims. Kruszelnicki has often criticized such accounts for their lack of credible evidence and reliance on anecdotal storytelling. The entertainment value of the myth overshadowed scientific explanations, cementing its place in pop culture for generations despite the absence of verifiable proof.Famous anecdote – the Bruce Gernon storyIn 1970, pilot Bruce Gernon reported encountering a strange tunnel-like cloud while flying through the Bermuda Triangle. He claimed his instruments malfunctioned, and upon exiting the cloud, he experienced a time discrepancy of about 30 minutes. The story has been widely discussed in books, documentaries, and paranormal circles, with some suggesting it could be evidence of a time warp. Kruszelnicki, however, remains skeptical, noting that the account is anecdotal and lacks corroborating evidence. Many experts, including Kruszelnicki, believe it could be explained by meteorological phenomena such as unusual cloud formations or optical illusions.Scientific consensus over Bermuda TriangleThe conclusion from NOAA, the US Navy, and Lloyd’s of London — all echoed by Kruszelnicki — is clear: the Bermuda Triangle is not more hazardous than any other heavily traveled ocean region. The so-called mystery is a product of natural hazards, geographic challenges, human mistakes, and decades of exaggerated storytelling. Statistically, the accident rates are consistent with those in other busy maritime and aviation areas. While the legend of the Bermuda Triangle may continue to inspire curiosity and creativity, the evidence, as Kruszelnicki emphasizes, points to a reality grounded in science, not the supernatural. Ultimately, the Bermuda Triangle’s greatest power lies not in sinking ships, but in captivating imaginations. It is a reminder that mystery often thrives where facts are overlooked, and that reality can be just as fascinating as myth.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Woman astronomer paid 30 cents an hour: unlocked cosmic distances; still missed out on Nobel Prize
Henrietta Swan Leavitt worked as a Harvard “computer” earning just 30 cents an hour, yet her groundbreaking discovery of the period-luminosity relationship transformed astronomy.

Her work enabled scientists to measure cosmic distances and understand the expanding universe. Despite this monumental contribution, Leavitt never received a Nobel Prize during her lifetime, highlighting the challenges faced by women in science.  Henrietta Swan Leavitt, an American astronomer whose groundbreaking discovery revolutionized how we measure the cosmos. Born in 1868, Leavitt began working at the Harvard College Observatory at a time when women were excluded from operating telescopes and instead employed as “computers” to analyze astronomical data. Despite earning just 30 cents an hour, her dedication and meticulous research led to one of the most important astronomical breakthroughs of the 20th century.In 1908, Leavitt discovered the period-luminosity relationship of Cepheid variable stars, showing a direct link between their brightness and pulsation period. This discovery became the key to measuring vast cosmic distances and ultimately helped astronomers like Edwin Hubble prove that the universe is expanding. Yet, despite her monumental contributions, Leavitt was never awarded a Nobel Prize during her lifetime.The discovery that changed astronomy foreverLeavitt’s key insight came from studying Cepheid variable stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, a galaxy assumed to be at a uniform distance from Earth. By carefully analyzing photographic plates, she found that the brightness of these stars varied in a predictable way tied to their pulsation period: the longer the period, the brighter the star. This relationship, now known as Leavitt’s Law, gave astronomers a powerful “standard candle,” an object of known brightness that can be used to calculate distances in space.Using this standard candle method, astronomers could measure how far away these stars and by extension, the galaxies they reside in actually were. This was a breakthrough in cosmic distance measurement, allowing scientists to determine the scale of the universe with unprecedented accuracy. Leavitt’s discovery became the foundation for Edwin Hubble’s later work in the 1920s where he used Cepheid variables to prove that the Milky Way was just one of many galaxies and that the universe itself was expanding.Overcoming barriers as a woman in scienceHenrietta Swan Leavitt’s career unfolded during a time when women faced serious discrimination in science. Women were largely relegated to supportive roles and denied opportunities such as telescope operation and academic recognition. Leavitt was paid a modest wage of about 30 cents an hour as a “computer” at Harvard, tasked with analyzing star data rather than conducting independent research.Despite these limitations, she showed extraordinary focus and persistence. Leavitt’s progressive hearing loss later in life made her work even more challenging, yet she continued her observations and calculations until her untimely death at the age of 53. Tragically, although her work was foundational for modern astronomy, she never received the Nobel Prize or equivalent accolades during her lifetime, and a posthumous nomination was not permitted.Legacy and lasting impact on cosmologyLeavitt’s period-luminosity relationship remains one of the cornerstones of astrophysics. It revolutionized the way distances to faraway celestial objects are measured, enabling astronomers to map the universe on a grand scale. This method underpins modern cosmology, helping scientists determine not only distances but also the rate at which the universe is expanding, key to the Big Bang theory.Edwin Hubble famously used Leavitt’s discovery to measure the distances to galaxies beyond the Milky Way and uncover the expanding nature of the universe, a milestone that forever changed humanity’s understanding of our place in the cosmos. Today, Henrietta Swan Leavitt is celebrated as a pioneering figure in astronomy whose brilliance and perseverance overcame societal and physical obstacles, leaving a profound legacy that continues to guide scientific exploration.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

These magnetic nanobots address tooth sensitivity. CalBots seal dentinal tubules using a bioceramic formula. Tests on extracted teeth show promising results. Animal trials demonstrate complete behavioral recovery. The team sees this as a step towards advanced nanorobotics. This innovation offers lasting relief for millions. The CalBots are made from safe materials.  BENGALURU: For millions of people, the sudden, sharp pain of tooth sensitivity can turn a sip of cold water into a jolt. Now, researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), in collaboration with Bengaluru-based deep-tech startup Theranautilus, have engineered “CalBots” – magnetic nanobots that can seal the problem at its source.As per IISc, CalBots are 400-nanometre particles loaded with a calcium silicate-based bioceramic formula, designed to travel deep inside dentinal tubules, the tiny tunnels in the tooth that lead to nerve endings. Guided by an external magnetic field, the bots can penetrate up to 500 micrometres into the tubules and self-assemble into stable, cement-like plugs that recreate the tooth’s natural barrier. One application, the team says, can offer lasting relief.Dental hypersensitivity affects nearly one in four people worldwide and occurs when enamel erosion or gum recession exposes the dentine layer beneath, IISc said. The tubules in dentine act as direct pathways to the nerves, which is why even mild temperature changes can trigger pain. “We didn’t want to create a slightly better version of what’s already out there. We wanted a technology that solves a real problem in a way that no one’s attempted before,” Shanmukh Peddi, postdoctoral researcher at IISc’s Centre for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE) and co-founder of Theranautilus. The team used a completely new class of bioceramic cement for the nanobots. While bioceramics are common in orthopaedics and dentistry, the formulation was designed specifically for hypersensitivity – to travel deeper and last longer.To test the approach, they worked first on extracted human teeth. “On these samples, we applied CalBots under a magnetic field for 20 minutes, during which the bots sealed the dentinal tubules by forming deep, stable plugs – a result confirmed through high-resolution imaging,” Peddi said.They then moved to animal trials, inducing sensitivity in mice and tracking their drinking behaviour. “Healthy mice drank both cold and room temperature water equally. But sensitive mice completely avoided cold water. After treatment, they started drinking it again. We saw 100% behavioural recovery. That was a big moment for us,” he said.The CalBots are made entirely from materials classified as ‘Generally Recognised as Safe’ and passed toxicity tests in mice. “This is a compelling demonstration of what nanorobotics can achieve, and how they could significantly impact future healthcare,” said Ambarish Ghosh, professor at CeNSE and one of the study’s corresponding authors.Debayan Dasgupta, former PhD student at CeNSE and co-founder of Theranautilus, sees this as part of a bigger technological shift. “We’ve created a regenerative, active nanomaterial – a step towards the kind of ‘tiny mechanical surgeons’ Richard Feynman once envisioned,” he said.Peddi added: “This is something we’ve worked towards silently for years. And the fact that we’ve done it here, in India, makes us very happy.”About the AuthorChethan KumarChethan Kumar is a Senior Assistant Editor with the Times of India.

Though smaller than initially thought, it remains the largest interstellar visitor known. Confirmed as a comet with a glowing tail, 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be twice as old as our solar system, offering a glimpse into the early universe.  NASA has revealed exciting new information about a mysterious interstellar object called 3I/ATLAS, speeding through our solar system at extraordinary velocities. First detected on July 1, this visitor from beyond our star system has fascinated scientists globally with its astonishing speed of 130,000 miles per hour and intriguing characteristics. Recent observations from the Hubble Space Telescope have captured the clearest images to date, offering key insights into its size, makeup, and path. These discoveries represent a significant advancement in our understanding of these rare travelers crossing the galaxy into our cosmic neighborhood, deepening knowledge about interstellar dynamics, cosmic evolution, and planetary defense strategies.NASA confirms 3I/ATLAS as the fastest interstellar object ever detectedNASA’s Hubble Space Telescope observations have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is travelling through our solar system at an extraordinary speed of 130,000 miles per hour (209,000 km/h), making it the fastest interstellar object ever recorded. This speed far exceeds that of previous interstellar visitors such as ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. Scientists explain that the object’s velocity is the result of billions of years of gravitational interactions, known as the “gravitational slingshot effect,” where passing stars, planets, and nebulae impart additional momentum to the comet. This extreme speed means the object is only briefly visible as it races through, providing a fleeting window of opportunity for study. NASA’s continuous monitoring aims to capture as much data as possible during its swift passage.Image: Daily MailSize estimates refined: NASA reveals 3I/ATLAS is smaller but still immenseInitial observations by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory suggested that 3I/ATLAS’s icy core might be around seven miles (11.2 km) wide. However, NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has now refined these estimates, revealing that the core is smaller — at most 3.5 miles (5.6 km) across, and possibly as little as 1,000 feet (320 meters) in diameter. Despite being smaller than first believed, this still makes 3I/ATLAS the largest interstellar object ever discovered, dwarfing the next largest known visitor by up to 14 times. The high-resolution images also highlight the comet’s glowing gas halo, which had made it appear larger in earlier, less detailed observations. Understanding the true size helps scientists model its composition, structural integrity, and behavior more accurately as it interacts with powerful solar radiation and cosmic forces.NASA confirms 3I/ATLAS’s cometary nature and its spectacular glowing tailThanks to NASA’s powerful telescopes, scientists have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is not a solid rock but a comet — a chunk of ice, frozen gases, and dust surrounded by a halo of evaporating material. The Hubble images reveal a dust plume streaming from the side of the comet heated by the Sun, along with a faint tail trailing behind it. This tail is formed as the comet’s surface warms up, causing ice to vaporize and release gas and dust into space, creating the characteristic glowing appearance. This phenomenon is similar to that seen in comets within our solar system, but 3I/ATLAS’s interstellar origin and extreme speed make it a rare and valuable subject for study. NASA expects the tail and dust plume to become more pronounced as the object approaches its closest point to the Sun. Scientists hope continued observation will shed light on the comet’s chemical composition, helping reveal clues about its interstellar origins. 3I/ATLAS offers humanity a fleeting glimpse into the mysteries of other star systems, carrying secrets older than our Sun itself.Ancient traveler: NASA estimates 3I/ATLAS is twice as old as our solar systemOne of the most astonishing revelations from NASA’s studies is the estimated age of 3I/ATLAS. Scientific analysis suggests this object has been orbiting the Milky Way for at least eight billion years — roughly twice the age of our own 4.6 billion-year-old solar system. This implies 3I/ATLAS formed long before our Sun and planets came into existence, making it a true cosmic relic. Its journey through the galaxy has likely included multiple gravitational encounters with stars and interstellar clouds, which may have shaped its trajectory and speed. Studying such an ancient object offers scientists a unique glimpse into the conditions and materials present in the early universe and helps refine models of galactic evolution. Its fleeting passage is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to study a messenger from the galaxy’s distant past. NASA researchers emphasize that each discovery from 3I/ATLAS brings us closer to understanding how planetary systems form and evolve across the galaxy.Safe passage confirmed by NASA: No threat to EarthDespite its immense speed and close approach to the Sun, NASA has assured the public that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth. The comet will reach its closest point to the Sun in late October, passing just inside the orbit of Mars at about 130 million miles (210 million kilometers). Crucially, it will be on the opposite side of the Sun relative to Earth during this time, ensuring no risk of collision or gravitational disturbance. NASA continues to monitor the comet’s trajectory precisely, as the interaction with the Sun’s heat may slightly alter its path. After passing the Sun, 3I/ATLAS will head back out into interstellar space, continuing its long journey through the galaxy. This may be humanity’s only chance to witness this ancient traveler before it disappears forever into the cosmic void. Its fleeting visit serves as a reminder of the vast, mysterious, and ever-changing nature of our universe.A new era of discovery: NASA leads the charge in interstellar object research3I/ATLAS marks only the third confirmed interstellar object ever detected, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. NASA’s advancements in telescope technology, sky surveys, and space observatories like Hubble have ushered in a new era of interstellar discovery. Researchers expect that as survey instruments become more sensitive and comprehensive, the frequency of detecting such visitors will increase. NASA plans to utilize not only Hubble but also the James Webb Space Telescope, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory to study 3I/ATLAS in multiple wavelengths. This will allow scientists to capture unprecedented data on the object's composition and interaction with the solar environment. These coordinated observations are crucial for building a more complete picture of interstellar objects and their origins. This coordinated effort will deepen our understanding of the composition, origin, and behavior of interstellar objects and their role in the cosmic ecosystem.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

These massive structures, sculpted by ancient underwater avalanches, indicate the Atlantic Ocean connected earlier than previously thought. This discovery provides insights into Cretaceous climate shifts and tectonic movements, offering crucial data for modern geology and climate science.  Buried nearly a kilometre beneath the Atlantic seabed west of Guinea-Bissau lies a geological time-capsule: gigantic 117-million-year-old mud waves sculpted by dense, underwater avalanches. A new study published in Global and Planetary Change reveals that these ancient structures were formed when early Atlantic waters carved through the Earth’s crust, much earlier than previously believed. This groundbreaking discovery reshapes our understanding of Atlantic Ocean formation, offers fresh perspectives on Cretaceous climate shifts, and provides crucial clues to tectonic movements that governed our planet’s evolving geography. From deep-sea sediment patterns to global carbon cycles and ocean circulation, these mud waves, once hidden, now tell a story with far-reaching implications for modern geology and climate science.Underwater mud waves push the Atlantic's birth date back to 117 million years agoRecent research published in Global and Planetary Change (2025) by Duarte, Nicholson, and colleagues has shed new light on the early history of the Atlantic Ocean. Using a combination of modern seismic imaging and archived drilling data from 1975, the team identified a series of massive 117-million-year-old mud waves buried deep beneath the Atlantic seafloor. These geological giants, stretching over a kilometer in length and rising hundreds of meters high, were formed when dense, salty water from the young North Atlantic spilled into the deeper southern basins, creating powerful underwater currents. The composition and layering of these mud waves reveal that such flows occurred far earlier than previously believed, suggesting that the Equatorial Atlantic Gateway, the oceanic passage linking the northern and southern Atlantic opened sooner than most geological models predicted. This pushes back the estimated timeline of when the Atlantic became a fully connected ocean, making the discovery a crucial piece in reconstructing Earth’s plate tectonic and oceanographic history. Not only does this finding refine our understanding of how and when the Atlantic took shape, but it also offers insights into the role of deep-water currents in shaping the seafloor over millions of years.Sediment patterns illuminate early ocean currents and climate changeThe formation of these 117-million-year-old mud waves was far more than an isolated ocean-floor event, it represented a profound turning point in Earth’s climate and geological history. When the young North Atlantic’s saline waters finally breached into the long-isolated southern basins, they encountered dense, carbon-rich deep waters that had been locked away for millions of years. This sudden mixing unleashed colossal underwater mud avalanches, cascading across the seabed with immense force and reshaping the ocean floor’s topography on a scale rarely seen in Earth’s past.The consequences reached far beyond the geology. This tectonic–oceanic upheaval likely interrupted one of the planet’s most important climate-regulating processes: the long-term burial of carbon in marine sediments. By disturbing these ancient, carbon-heavy layers, the event may have kept vast amounts of greenhouse gases circulating in the atmosphere, helping sustain the elevated global temperatures characteristic of the mid-Cretaceous, a period often referred to as one of Earth’s “greenhouse worlds.” Such persistent warmth not only influenced ocean chemistry and circulation but also shaped the evolution and distribution of marine life for millions of years afterward.Understanding precisely when the Equatorial Atlantic Gateway opened is therefore critical. It marks the moment the Atlantic transitioned from a series of isolated basins into a fully connected ocean, altering heat and nutrient flows on a global scale. By reconstructing this event, scientists can better model ancient ocean currents, climate feedback loops, and the deep-time mechanisms that still echo in today’s climate system. In essence, these mud waves are not just relics of a vanished seafloor, they are a geological signature of the forces that have shaped, and continue to shape, Earth’s climate trajectory.Why this discovery matters: from paleoceanography to climate modellingKnowing that the Atlantic began to take shape around 117 million years ago, evidence preserved in those colossal buried mud waves, significantly sharpens scientists’ ability to model ancient ocean behaviour, tectonic shifts, and climate feedback loops. This revised timeline offers a clearer window into how early ocean gateways controlled the movement of heat across the planet, regulated carbon sequestration in marine sediments, and set the stage for long-term cooling or warming trends.By tracing these deep-time processes, researchers can better understand the intricate relationship between ocean circulation and Earth’s climate system. Crucially, such knowledge is not confined to the past, it provides a framework for anticipating the effects of today’s oceanic changes. From accelerating polar ice melt to shifting global currents, the same mechanisms that once shaped the Cretaceous world could, in altered form, dictate the trajectory of our future climate.Also read| Study reveals nature's hardest teeth: Chitons inspire future material designAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.
