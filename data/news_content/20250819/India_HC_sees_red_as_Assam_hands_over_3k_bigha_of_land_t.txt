Gauhati HC GUWAHATI: A contentious mining lease granted to a private cement company for 3,000 bighas (4.01 sq km) in Assam's Dima Hasao district led an incredulous Gauhati high court judge to question on camera if it was "some kind of joke or what" that "public interest" had been sacrificed at the altar of business."The entire district? What is going on? 3,000 bighas allotted to a private company? What kind of decision is this?" Justice Sanjay Kumar Medhi is heard saying in courtroom footage, seemingly taken aback by a counsel's submission on the parcel of land at stake. When the lawyer representing Mahabal Cement Ltd argues that the disputed area near Umrangso "is barren land", Justice Medhi interjects, "We know how barren is NC Hills (Dima Hasao's erstwhile name)." Seconds later, the judge is seen rebuking the lawyer again just as she picks up a sheaf of documents in preparation for further arguments."No, no, your lordship, we need it (the land). It's because of..." the counsel says before Justice Medhi interrupts her."Your need is not the issue, madam. Public interest is the issue," the judge says.The high court was hearing two petitions - one filed by Dima Hasao resident Sonesh Hojai and 21 others against the state govt and Mahabal Cement Ltd, and another by the company against the state govt and 10 others. Dima Hasao, one among six tribal-dominant districts of the state, is a biodiverse region famous for its hot springs, forests, migratory bird habitats and wildlife. As mandated by the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, an elected autonomous council administers the district.Justice Medhi has directed the North Cachar Hills Autonomous Council's standing counsel, C Sarma, to "obtain records containing the policy to allot such a huge chunk of land to a factory" and submit these to the court at the next hearing. "The direction has been given by taking into account that the district is a 6th Scheduled district under the Constitution of India, where the priority has to be given to the rights and interest of the tribal people residing there," stated the order.A video of the judge's exchange with the company's lawyer has been widely shared on social media.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousPreity Mukhundhan radiates eleganceEntertainmentNeha Harsora’s dazzling and dreamy ethnic lookstvBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning weekend looks of the contestantstvFun facts about the Param Sundari actor Sidharth MalhotraEntertainment8 simple habits that will help reduce stress on the eyes and improve vision naturallyLifestyle8 times Samantha Ruth Prabhu turned perfect muse for Krésha BajajLifestyleSaree tales by actress Nisha RavikrishnantvManasi Parekh Serves Style & SmilesEntertainment10 celebrity-inspired Indian baby boy namesLifestyle10 animals that look like they are hand paintedLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Movies that capture the strength of smiling through painHigh uric acid levels linked to high BP, diabetes and heart disease: Early symptoms to watch forWorld Photography Day 2025: Explore India’s most photogenic Blue Flag beachesIncredible India: Know all about the pride and joy of Puneri PagadisUrvashi Rautela turns heads with glamorous outfitBig-city girl reunites with first love in timeless Bollywood romanceKajol’s entry redefined the idea of a heroine on screenBigg Boss Telugu 9: Meet the judges of the pre-show, “Agnipariksha”Jab We Met, Bareilly Ki Barfi, Mujhse Shaadi Karogi: Binge these rom-com hits on OTT before Param Sundari'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' to 'Annabelle': Horror movies to binge watch on OTT before 'The Conjuring: Last Rites' releases123Hot PicksCP RadhakrishnanMumbai RainsHurricane Erin 2025Brooklyn Nightclub ShootingMarco RubioCrimeaBank Holidays AugustTop TrendingPatrick MahomesAntonio BrownRaheem MorrisJoy TaylorTravis Hunters WifeOlivia Paige DunneMartina NavratilovaMarco BelinelliPatrick MahomesTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteIndia Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Shubman Gill dilemma - Selectors face tough call ahead of Asia Cup squad announcementRow over Indian-origin truck driver Harjinder Singh: California Guv's office says he entered US under Trump presidency'Scared to go back to India': Truck driver Harjinder Singh who killed 3 in Florida was allowed to stay in US in 2018 on $5,000 bondStephen Curry’s wife Ayesha Curry shares an unforgettable moment of baby Cai walking on his dad’s footstepsVanessa Bryant finally breaks silence on wild pregnancy rumors with a wild response featuring a Rihanna meme'If you are trying to brain-drain Bangalore...': US economist's H-1B explanation goes viralAre Travis Hunter and Leanna Lenee really divorcing?
