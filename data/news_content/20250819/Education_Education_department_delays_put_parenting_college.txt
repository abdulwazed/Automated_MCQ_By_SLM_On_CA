(Getty Images) Parenting college students across the US are facing significant challenges due to delays in federal child care funding, jeopardising their ability to continue their education. The US Department of Education has postponed grant applications for several federal programmes, including the Child Care Access Means Parents in School (CCAMPIS) grant, which provides crucial support to student parents.The CCAMPIS grant, established by Congress in 1998, offers millions of dollars to colleges to fund campus-based child care services. This includes staff salaries, before- and after-school programmes, subsidies, and advising to help students with young children stay in school. However, delays in renewing this funding threaten to leave many parenting students without child care support early in the new academic year.Federal funding delays threaten vital child care supportThe CCAMPIS grant distributed over $83 million to hundreds of colleges in fiscal year 2023, with the average award exceeding $317,000 per institution, according to federal data cited by USA Today. This funding plays a key role in helping approximately one in five undergraduate students, who have children, complete their degrees.Carmina Garcia, a nursing student at Pima Community College in Arizona and mother of three young children, told USA Today, "I don't know how I could've done it any other way. If I wouldn't have found this, I don't think that I would be pursuing the education that I'm pursuing." Yet, her college has warned that the child care programme will end on September 30 due to funding delays.Similarly, Mahogany-Ann Fowler, an architecture student at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, faces uncertainty as her college's CCAMPIS funding is also set to expire on the same date. IUP spokesperson Michelle Fryling confirmed to USA Today that the university is "unsure of any personnel changes related to the end of this grant."Education Department cuts and grant delays cause confusionThe delays come after the US Department of Education halved its workforce in March under President Trump's administration. Typically, CCAMPIS renewal applications open in late May and close by July. However, the Education Department did not open applications this year, leaving students and colleges in limbo.James Hermes, associate vice president of government relations at the American Association of Community Colleges, told USA Today, "We're still very much on the edge of our seats." Experts suggest the delay could be due to staffing shortages or possible attempts to reduce funding, as President Trump's budget proposal suggested eliminating CCAMPIS funding altogether.Eddy Conroy, senior policy manager at New America, was quoted by USA Today questioning whether this is "a capacity issue" or "a backdoor way to illegally impound funds that have been appropriated."Students scramble for alternatives as support disappearsHannah Fuller, a 22-year-old student at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and a three-year CCAMPIS recipient, said her college is encouraging her to apply for state childcare programmes. Fuller told USA Today, "He would never see me," referring to her 4-year-old son, if she had to take on extra work to cover childcare.One college, Mount Wachusett Community College in Massachusetts, has taken proactive steps. Ann Reynolds, the CCAMPIS adviser, secured $94,000 from the college foundation to cover two years of childcare support, ensuring current students remain supported even if federal funds are delayed, as reported by USA Today.The ongoing delays in federal child care funding are creating considerable uncertainty for parenting college students nationwide, raising concerns about their ability to continue their education without this essential support.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.
