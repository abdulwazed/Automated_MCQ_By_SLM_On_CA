Marsh, who led Australia to a 2-1 victory in the T20I series, will continue his captaincy role as regular captain Pat Cummins takes a rest.   The Australian team successfully implemented an attacking strategy from the start in the T20I series, though it occasionally resulted in batting collapses.   "Getting ready to spend three and a half hours in the field will be a little bit different for a few of the boys. But as a group and as a whole, nothing really changes. (There's a) bit of a mindset change, it's obviously different format. But the same stuff rolls on," Marsh told reporters on Monday.   Marsh has experience leading Australia in ODIs, having captained nine times previously, including tours to South Africa in 2023 and England in 2024 when Cummins was unavailable.   The Australian captain suggested they might continue their preference for chasing targets in the ODI series, similar to their T20I approach.   "It's a bit of a common trend, generally speaking, in T20 cricket these days. You get to assess the conditions, but you also just know what you're chasing. I'm certainly not afraid to bat first. But we have lent towards bowling first. Playing with dew is not something that we're used to in Australia. We saw the ball get really soft in Darwin. That's been a different challenge for us," he elaborated.   The ODI series will continue with the second and third matches scheduled at the Great Barrier Reef Arena in Mackay on Friday and Sunday.

Australia have shown good discipline with the ball as spin has been effective, and a few chances here and there have been created. However, the Aussies haven't been able to string wickets in clusters, which has allowed the Proteas to string partnerships. With 8 wickets in hand and a couple of proper hitters yet to come, the tourists seem to be off to a big total on a slow pitch. Currently, this stand between Matthew Breetzke and skipper Temba Bavuma has stitched together 53 runs, and Australia are in search of a breakthrough. A couple of quick wickets moving towards the climax of the innings could prove handy. But they need them now. A change in bowling as Aaron Hardie returns for another spell. He is 1-0-13-0 so far. Also, as per the new ICC rules, it seems like Australia have picked one ball of the two to continue till the end of the innings. 12:19 (IST) Aug 19Score after 34 overs 184 - 2Runs Scored: 0 004001Matthew Breetzke 36 (36)Temba Bavuma 31 (44)Nathan Ellis5-0-27-01Overs33.6Score184 - 2 Nathan Ellis to Matthew Breetzke, Length ball, angled into off and middle, Breetzke is late on the shot but jams his bat down in time and gets it in front of point for a single.12:19 (IST) Aug 190Overs33.5Score183 - 2 Nathan Ellis to Matthew Breetzke, This one stays low!

Following his impressive performance in the T20I series, Brevis' entry marks South Africa's preparation for the 2027 ODI World Cup, which they will co-host with Zimbabwe and Namibia.

Temba Bavuma, fresh from lifting the World Test Championship mace at Lord's, will lead the South African side. The team sees the return of Keshav Maharaj in the spin department, while Bavuma has confirmed his position at No. 3 in the batting order.

Wiaan Mulder seeks to build on his bowling success from the Champions Trophy as he aims to cement his place in the 50-over format.

The Australian team faces lineup changes due to injuries to Matt Short, Mitchell Owen, and Lance Morris. This has created opportunities for newcomers Cooper Connolly, Aaron Hardie, and Matt Kuhnemann.

Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc will not participate in the series. Marnus Labuschagne returns to the squad, looking to revive his international career after being dropped from the Test side earlier this year.

Mitchell Marsh will captain the Australian side. He has indicated a preference for bowling first after winning the toss, though dew conditions in Cairns may affect this decision.

The venue's history suggests challenging batting conditions. Previous ODIs between Australia and New Zealand in 2022 saw totals rarely exceeding 267, favoring the bowling sides.

Cameron Green, who scored his highest ODI score of 89 not out at this ground, is expected to play a key role, potentially batting at No. 3.

With three matches scheduled over five days, Australia plans to rotate their fast bowlers, giving South Africa varying bowling combinations to face.

Brevis, known for his aggressive batting style and ability to hit boundaries, represents South Africa's future in ODI cricket as they begin their journey toward the 2027 World Cup.

The series presents an opportunity for both teams to test new talent while maintaining competitive standards in this established cricket rivalry.TrendingKagiso RabadaAUS vs SA Live ScoreSuryakumar YadavAbhishek SharmaIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIga SwiatekWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementCarlos AlcarazVarun ChakravarthyRohit SharmaKagiso RabadaAUS vs SA Live ScoreSuryakumar YadavAbhishek SharmaIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIga SwiatekWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementCarlos AlcarazVarun ChakravarthyRohit SharmaKagiso RabadaAUS vs SA Live ScoreSuryakumar YadavAbhishek SharmaIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIga SwiatekWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementCarlos AlcarazVarun ChakravarthyRohit SharmaTired of too many ads?go ad free nowMatch StatisticsHead to Head in ODITotal Matches 1105155VenueCazaly's Stadium, CairnsAUS PLAYING XIMitchell Marsh (C)Travis HeadMarnus LabuschagneSee AllSA PLAYING XIAiden MarkramRyan Rickelton (W)Temba Bavuma (C)See AllTop Stories Right NowRussell Wilson's wife Ciara becomes first descendants of enslaved Africans to re...Stephen Curry’s wife Ayesha Curry shares an unforgettable moment of baby Cai wal...Maple Leafs fans on edge as Connor McDavid’s new contract update sparks speculat...More TOP StoriesQuick LinksWTC Points TableNHL NewsNBA NewsEsports and Gaming NewsLatest Cricket NewsWWE NewsCricket Match ScheduleInternational SportsMLB NewsNFL NewsEducation NewsLive Cricket ScoreExplore Every CornerAcross The GlobeIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementICAI CA Admit CardAUS vs SA LiveVP CandidateShubhanshu ShuklaMumbai RainsSimone TataAlaska MeetWang YiCP RadhakrishnanRahul GandhiZelenskyyHarjinder SinghGiorgia MeloniIsraeli Intel ChiefKristi NoemWWE Raw ResultsDubai Pink DiamondGST RatesWang YiUS Student VisaFASTag Annual PassBank Holidays AugustHamas CeasefireMumbai school closedBattlefield 6Stephanie WhiteTyson BagentConnor McDavidAbout usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesLiving and EntertainmentCricbuzzLifestyleNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTVTimes PrimeTravel DestinationsWhats HotETimesTimes LifeTimes PetsMyLifeXPServicesCouponDuniaTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgetsTimes EventsWork with UsColombiaHot on the WebAchyut Potdar Death NewsVitamins For Hair GrowthKidney Disease SymptomsCloves Health BenefitsReverse Fatty LiverTulsi Health BenefitsAbhinav ShuklaBlood Pressure ManagementAR MurugadossLongest International RiverSaswata ChatterjeeLow Value CurrencyLow CholesterolAmeesha PatelKidney Cancer SymptomsArmaan MalikCancer RiskJaanWorst States In AmericaFaissal KhanLiver Disease SymptomsAngelina JolieMonsoon Snake PreventionBlood Pressure ManagementWar 2 Box Office CollectionArchana Puran SinghCoolie Movie ReviewCoolie Box Office CollectionMahavatar Narsimha Box Office CollectionGarlic BenefitsDarshan ThoogudeepaColon Cancer SymptomsSanskrit EffectNatural SupplementsHigh Cholesterol SymptomsSide Effects Of Dragon FruitColorectal CancerOral SymptomsReduce Face Fat DietSide Effects Of BananasGinger Tea Side EffectsKidney Damage SymptomsTrending TopicsMadison BeerAdam SchefterNFL New DealTravis KelceDonald TrumpKelly StaffordUPSC EPFO RecruitmentWho is Anmoljit SinghMDSU BA SEM 1 ResultSBI PO Prelims ResultAbhishek SharmaAmbati RayuduRohit SharmaWho is Brian OkelleyNEET UG CounsellingBihar Jeevika RecruitmentWB NEET UG CounsellingNEET PG Result 2025Sarfaraz KhanDelhi Girl RescueMumbai Red AlertOperation SindoorMeerut Army Jawan AssaultedManish SisodiaSurat Phone in WashroomMumbai Travel AdvisoryMumbai RainsDwarka Expressway UER 2 InaugurationDelhi RapeAir India Flight NewsJeff BezosFastag Annual PassAnupam MittalGeoffrey HintonSridhar VembuApple iPhone 17Nyt ConnectionsMega Tsunami WarningAirtel DownJamie DimonWordle TodaySteve JobsPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth+ TipsIndian TV ShowsTechnologyTravelEtimesHealth & FitnessNFLAugust Long Weekend 2025India vs EnglandAstrologyWeather TodayPlatinum Rate TodaySilver Rate TodayGold Rate TodayIs Bank open todayIs Bank Open TomorrowBank Holidays in AugustPublic Holidays in AugustStock Market HolidaysFinancial CalculatorsTechnology NewsInternational SportsPublic HolidaysBank HolidaysLatest NewsAugust 2025’s night sky will sparkle with 1,00,000 stars at once: Know when and where to watchRJS 2025 prelims result out on hcraj.nic.in;
