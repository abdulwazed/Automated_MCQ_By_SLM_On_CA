The tournament, featuring eight teams, will begin September 30 with India hosting all matches except Pakistan's games, which will be played in Colombo.   India enters the World Cup with strong momentum after defeating England in white-ball series and winning the ODI tri-series involving Sri Lanka and South Africa in April. The team will also host Australia for three ODIs as part of their preparation.   The selectors face a crucial decision regarding Shafali Verma's inclusion in the batting lineup. Since her return against England, she has shown mixed form with scores of 3, 47, 31, and 75, followed by underwhelming performances against Australia A scoring 3, 3, and 41.   The current batting order appears settled with Smriti Mandhana and Pratika Rawal opening, supported by Jemimah Rodrigues, Harleen Deol, and captain Harmanpreet Kaur in the middle order.   Renuka Thakur's fitness assessment will be another key consideration. The premier seam bowler has been sidelined since March, and her recovery status will be evaluated considering the upcoming World Cup's workload demands.   Richa Ghosh is set to be the primary wicketkeeper, with Yastika Bhatia, who recently scored two fifties against Australia A in Brisbane, as a potential backup. 12:29 (IST) Aug 19Women's World Cup Squad Live: Tournament Details OutThe ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025 will run from September 30 to November 2.

Stay tuned. Women's World Cup India Team Squad Live: The selection committee led by Neetu David is set to announce India's Women's ODI World Cup squad and the team for the three-match home ODI series against Australia on Tuesday afternoon. The same squad is likely to be chosen for both events, with only minimal changes possible based on the decisions of the five-member selection committee and team management.

The selection committee is also expected to pick an India A team for the World Cup warm-up game against South Africa at the BCCI Centre of Excellence Ground in Bengaluru.

The first two women's ODIs between India and Australia will be held at the Mullanpur stadium on September 14 and 17, followed by the final match at New Delhi's Arun Jaitley Stadium on September 20.

Mullanpur will host women's international cricket for the first time, while New Delhi will stage a women's ODI after nearly 28 years.

The Indian team, under Harmanpreet Kaur's leadership, enters its final World Cup preparation phase after successful ODI tri-series victory in Sri Lanka and white-ball series wins in England.

Smriti Mandhana, Harmanpreet Kaur, Jemimah Rodrigues, and Richa Ghosh are confirmed for the batting lineup. Pratika Rawal, who has scored 703 runs since her debut last year, and Harleen Deol are likely to continue, with Yastika Bhatia as second wicketkeeper.

Shafali Verma's selection remains uncertain due to inconsistent performance. Despite head coach Amol Muzumdar indicating her consideration for World Cup selection, her recent scores in Australia have been modest.

Amanjot Kaur, who replaced the injured Pooja Vastrakar, faces careful workload management due to a back injury from the England ODI series. While cleared to play, she might be reserved for crucial World Cup matches.TrendingKagiso RabadaAUS vs SA Live ScoreSuryakumar YadavAbhishek SharmaIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIga SwiatekWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementCarlos AlcarazVarun ChakravarthyRohit SharmaKagiso RabadaAUS vs SA Live ScoreSuryakumar YadavAbhishek SharmaIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIga SwiatekWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementCarlos AlcarazVarun ChakravarthyRohit SharmaKagiso RabadaAUS vs SA Live ScoreSuryakumar YadavAbhishek SharmaIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIga SwiatekWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementCarlos AlcarazVarun ChakravarthyRohit SharmaTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTop Stories Right NowRussell Wilson's wife Ciara becomes first descendants of enslaved Africans to re...Stephen Curry’s wife Ayesha Curry shares an unforgettable moment of baby Cai wal...Maple Leafs fans on edge as Connor McDavid’s new contract update sparks speculat...More TOP StoriesQuick LinksWTC Points TableNHL NewsNBA NewsEsports and Gaming NewsLatest Cricket NewsWWE NewsCricket Match ScheduleInternational SportsMLB NewsNFL NewsEducation NewsLive Cricket ScoreExplore Every CornerAcross The GlobeIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementICAI CA Admit CardAUS vs SA LiveVP CandidateShubhanshu ShuklaMumbai RainsSimone TataAlaska MeetWang YiCP RadhakrishnanRahul GandhiZelenskyyHarjinder SinghGiorgia MeloniIsraeli Intel ChiefKristi NoemWWE Raw ResultsDubai Pink DiamondGST RatesWang YiUS Student VisaFASTag Annual PassBank Holidays AugustHamas CeasefireMumbai school closedRJS Prelims ResultStephanie WhiteTyson BagentConnor McDavidAbout usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesLiving and EntertainmentCricbuzzLifestyleNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTVTimes PrimeTravel DestinationsWhats HotETimesTimes LifeTimes PetsMyLifeXPServicesCouponDuniaTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgetsTimes EventsWork with UsColombiaHot on the WebAchyut Potdar Death NewsVitamins For Hair GrowthKidney Disease SymptomsCloves Health BenefitsReverse Fatty LiverTulsi Health BenefitsAbhinav ShuklaBlood Pressure ManagementAR MurugadossLongest International RiverSaswata ChatterjeeLow Value CurrencyLow CholesterolAmeesha PatelKidney Cancer SymptomsArmaan MalikCancer RiskJaanWorst States In AmericaFaissal KhanLiver Disease SymptomsAngelina JolieMonsoon Snake PreventionBlood Pressure ManagementWar 2 Box Office CollectionArchana Puran SinghCoolie Movie ReviewCoolie Box Office CollectionMahavatar Narsimha Box Office CollectionGarlic BenefitsDarshan ThoogudeepaColon Cancer SymptomsSanskrit EffectNatural SupplementsHigh Cholesterol SymptomsSide Effects Of Dragon FruitColorectal CancerOral SymptomsReduce Face Fat DietSide Effects Of BananasGinger Tea Side EffectsKidney Damage SymptomsTrending TopicsMadison BeerAdam SchefterNFL New DealTravis KelceDonald TrumpD GukeshUPSC EPFO RecruitmentWho is Anmoljit SinghMDSU BA SEM 1 ResultSBI PO Prelims ResultAbhishek SharmaAmbati RayuduRohit SharmaWho is Brian OkelleyNEET UG CounsellingBihar Jeevika RecruitmentWB NEET UG CounsellingNEET PG Result 2025Sarfaraz KhanDelhi Girl RescueMumbai Red AlertOperation SindoorMeerut Army Jawan AssaultedManish SisodiaSurat Phone in WashroomMumbai Travel AdvisoryMumbai RainsDwarka Expressway UER 2 InaugurationDelhi RapeAir India Flight NewsJeff BezosFastag Annual PassAnupam MittalGeoffrey HintonSridhar VembuApple iPhone 17Nyt ConnectionsMega Tsunami WarningAirtel DownJamie DimonWordle TodaySteve JobsPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth+ TipsIndian TV ShowsTechnologyTravelEtimesHealth & FitnessNFLAugust Long Weekend 2025India vs EnglandAstrologyWeather TodayPlatinum Rate TodaySilver Rate TodayGold Rate TodayIs Bank open todayIs Bank Open TomorrowBank Holidays in AugustPublic Holidays in AugustStock Market HolidaysFinancial CalculatorsTechnology NewsInternational SportsPublic HolidaysBank HolidaysLatest NewsUS Open 2025: Mixed doubles offers big names, big money and big question markUAE: Falcon prices hit $10,000 at Abu Dhabi auctions ahead of major hunting and equestrian expoNo 'harsh action' against strays till SC order: Delhi CM Rekha GuptaIs Vietnam going too far with its tax revolution?'Paradha' pre-release event: Director Praveen Kandregula says women-centric films deserve box office wins too - ReadHate crime in UK: Teenagers attack Sikh men, remove their turbans - videoThiruvananthapuram Medical College bars faculty from public criticism of govt policies, institutional matterAmbulance row: TN health minister Ma Subramanian slams Edappadi K Palaniswami over threat to staff;
