Discussions included the challenges of space travel and experiments with food. Modi emphasized the need for more Indian astronauts. Shukla stressed the importance of government support for space research. PM Modi met Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla in New Delhi on Monday.  (ANI) NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday met Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, who returned to Earth in July after completing NASA’s Axiom-4 mission, becoming the first Indian in four decades to travel to space. During their interaction, Shukla shared that people around the world are following India’s upcoming Gaganyaan mission with great enthusiasm. “Wherever I went, whoever I met, everyone was very happy to meet me, very excited. The biggest thing was that everyone knew about what India is doing in the field of space. Everyone knew about this, and many people were more excited about Gaganyaan. They would come and ask me, ‘When is your mission going?’ And my crew members made me sign that whenever Gaganyaan is gone, you will invite us to the launch,” he said. PM Modi asked him, “As the first Indian to reach there, what are your thoughts? And what kind of questions do people ask?” Shukla replied that the interest was overwhelming and reflected India’s growing stature in space exploration.PollDo you think India's Gaganyaan mission will inspire future generations to pursue careers in space exploration?Yes, absolutely!No, not really. The prime minister also inquired about the physical changes after such a long journey in space. Shukla explained, “The environment up there is very different. Once we reach space, we can remove our seat belts and move around inside the capsule. The heart rate slows down, but the body starts adjusting in 3-4 days. But when we return to Earth, the body takes time to readjust. Even though I was healthy, I couldn't walk properly. People had to hold me for support.” When asked about experiments with moong and methi (fenugreek), Shukla described the challenge of food in space. “Food is a big challenge on a space station; there is less space, and cargo is expensive. You always try to pack as many calories and nutrients as possible in the least space, and experiments are going on in every way. They are very easy to grow and need very few resources, just a little water, and they sprout in only 8 days. These are some of the secrets of our country.” PM Modi recalled that Shukla was once called a “tag genius” and asked him the reason behind it. Shukla responded, “…When I joined the Air Force, I thought that I would not have to study, but I will have to study a lot after that. And after becoming a test pilot, it becomes a discipline of engineering. So I think we were well prepared, when we reached for this mission...The mission has been successful, we have returned, but this mission is not the end, it is the beginning...” The prime minister stressed the need for India to have a pool of 40-50 astronauts. Shukla, reflecting on his own journey, said children today are far more hopeful about becoming astronauts than his generation was. “When I was young, Rakesh Sharma sir went for the first time in 1984, but the dream of becoming an astronaut never came to my mind because we did not have any program. But when I went to the station this time, I spoke to the children three times. In every program, the children asked how can I become an astronaut? So I think this in itself is a big success for our country. In today’s India, they know that it is possible. We have the option and we can become. And like you said, it is my responsibility, I feel I got a lot of opportunities to represent my country and now it is my responsibility to take as many people as possible to this level.” PM Modi added, “Space station and Gaganyaan. These are our big missions. Your experience will be very useful in that.” Shukla praised the government’s commitment to space research, even in the face of setbacks. “I think somewhere there is a very big opportunity for us, especially because the kind of commitment our government has made to sustain the space program, budget every year, inspite of failures like Chandrayaan 2. Even after that, we said no, we will move ahead. Chandrayaan 3 was successful. Even after such failures, if we are getting so much support and the whole world is seeing this. We have the capability, so we can acquire a leadership role here. You talked about Atmanirbharta in space manufacturing... So all these things are connected in the same way.” To this, PM Modi said, “If we do it self-reliantly, we will do well.” Shukla returned to Earth on July 15 after a three-week stay aboard the International Space Station during NASA’s Axiom-4 mission, which launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on June 25. He splashed down off the coast of California and arrived in New Delhi on Sunday. His mission made him the first Indian since Rakesh Sharma in 1984 to travel to space.WATCH FULL VIDEOAbout the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Supreme Court questions toll fees on Kerala highway; slams NHAI over poor roadsTOI News Desk / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Updated: Aug 19, 2025, 12:06 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLarge Supreme Court (Image credits: ANI) NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday slammed toll collection on dilapidated highways that leave commuters stranded, remarking that commuters pay despite suffering long delays, drawing parallel to the national capital, noting few hours of rain can bring Delhi to a standstill.A bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justices K Vinod Chandran and N V Anjaria made the observation while hearing appeals filed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and concessionaire Guruvayoor Infrastructure. The appeals challenge a Kerala high court order that suspended toll collection at the Paliyekkara toll plaza in Thrissur for four weeks over the poor condition of the Edappally–Mannuthy stretch of National Highway 544 and severe traffic congestion from ongoing works."Why should a person pay Rs 150 if it takes 12 hours for him to get from one end of the road to the other end? A road which is expected to take one hour, takes 11 more hours and they have to pay a toll as well,” the CJI said, as quoted by PTI.PollIn your opinion, should toll fees be adjusted during severe traffic delays?Yes, definitelyNo, they should remain the sameSolicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for NHAI, argued that the jam had been caused by a lorry overturning, which he described as an “act of God.” Justice Chandran disagreed, saying, “The accident which triggered the block was not a mere act of God but caused by a lorry toppling into a pothole.” Mehta added that service roads had been provided and blamed monsoon rains for slowing work, suggesting proportionate toll reduction instead of suspension. Justice Chandran, however, remarked that a 12-hour ordeal went far beyond proportional adjustment, reported PTI.“In Delhi, you know what happens... if it rains for two hours, the entire city gets paralysed,” the bench also observed, underscoring the plight of commuters on poorly maintained roads.Senior advocate Jayant Muthraj, appearing for the original petitioners, argued that NHAI had the responsibility to ensure a motorable road and that collecting toll amid such conditions violated public trust. He said the high court had suspended toll collection only as a last resort after earlier interim directions.The high court’s August 6 order held that motorists could not be charged when highways were badly maintained and congestion severe, stressing that the NHAI–public relationship was one of “public trust.”The Supreme Court has reserved its verdict on the case.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

In several cases, it proposes to introduce "improvement notices" for first-time violations, replacing fines with penalties and giving violators an opportunity to rectify their non-compliance.Introducing the bill, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said it seeks to enhance trust-based governance for ease of doing business. The bill was referred to the select committee of LS for scrutiny, which is to submit its report by the first day of the next session of Parliament.The Bill seeks to simplify 355 provisions - decriminalising 288 provisions and amending 67. It uses the term "contraventions" instead of "offence" to give an opportunity to violators to mend their ways. It proposes to rationalise penalties for repeat violations.PollShould imprisonment be removed for minor offences according to the new bill?Yes, it makes sense.No, it should remain.Officials said the bill reflects a shift from the earlier approach of "penalise on first detection" to a "warning-correct-penalise" model, which would promote voluntary compliance. For deterrence, a steep hike in penalties has been proposed for second and subsequent violations in several cases.For example, in the Central Silk Board Act, 1948, the bill proposes to replace the provision of imprisonment of up to one year and up to Rs 1,000 fine to "warning" for first contravention while for subsequent violations the proposed penalty has been hiked manifold (Rs 25,000-1 lakh) for furnishing any false statement. Similarly, the proposed penalty for manufacturing and sale of Ayurvedic, Siddha or Unani drugs in contravention to the provision of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act is three times more. As per the bill, the provision of up to six months' jail and fine of at least Rs 10,000 would be replaced with only fine of at least Rs 30,000.The bill proposes to amend provisions related to sectors such as agriculture export, industries, transport, electricity, municipal services, textile and coir. It states that the fear of imprisonment for minor offences is a "major factor" hampering the business ecosystem and individual confidence.The legislation proposes to amend 20 provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act to provide relaxation and clarity in compliance, including statewide vehicle registration instead of jurisdiction-specific; driving licence (DL) renewal effective from date of renewal if applied after expiry; 30 days grace period after licence expiry; reporting period for vehicle registration cancellation extended to 30 days from 14; and insurer intimation period on transfer of insurance certificate extended to 30 days from 14.However, for stricter action against air-pollution, the bill proposes Rs 10,000 fine and disqualification to hold DL for first offence while jail and penalty for subsequent offence. This proposes to set a 12-month timeline for claims tribunals to dispose of accident related cases.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousTaarak Mehta’s Sunayana Fozdar’s top 10 ethnic lookstv'Coolie' actress Rachita Ram's most gorgeous picturesEntertainmentPreity Mukhundhan radiates eleganceEntertainmentNeha Harsora’s dazzling and dreamy ethnic lookstvBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning weekend looks of the contestantstvFun facts about the Param Sundari actor Sidharth MalhotraEntertainment8 simple habits that will help reduce stress on the eyes and improve vision naturallyLifestyle8 times Samantha Ruth Prabhu turned perfect muse for Krésha BajajLifestyleSaree tales by actress Nisha RavikrishnantvManasi Parekh Serves Style & SmilesEntertainment Next123 Photostories  When Bollywood dared to break silence on social injusticeFrom 68.5 to 55 kg in Just 45 Days: Sunita Gogoi shares the discipline behind her 13 kg weight loss journeySmiles replace tensions as Zelenskyy visits Trump: EU, Nato leaders rally at White House - photos10 lesser known health benefits of eating cardamomWhy Ganga aarti is performed every evening: Understanding its spiritual significanceHow to make Chia Seed and Coconut Oil hair mask for quick hair growthBrown bread vs multigrain bread vs white bread, which is worse?Power passports: Citizens of these 5 countries can enter 185+ nations visa-free or on arrivalHow to build a timeless wardrobe inspired by Meryl StreepMovies that capture the strength of smiling through pain123Hot PicksCP RadhakrishnanMumbai RainsHurricane Erin 2025Brooklyn Nightclub ShootingMarco RubioCrimeaBank Holidays AugustTop TrendingPatrick MahomesAntonio BrownRaheem MorrisJoy TaylorTravis Hunters WifeOlivia Paige DunneMartina NavratilovaMarco BelinelliPatrick MahomesTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteINDIA bloc continues SIR protest: Telangana Congress demands urea for farmers; ruckus adjourns parliamentHow 'India’s secrets' helped Shubhanshu Shukla in space: Astronaut shares experience with PM Modi - WatchWhy should one pay to spend 12 hours in traffic jams?

Twenty tourists sat trapped in Ranthambore's Zone-6 - a 25sqkm territory locals call "three-tiger country". Time: 6pm. Darkness set in and the forest closed in. Panic spread. Parents whispered words of comfort to shush their crying children.For an hour and 45 minutes Saturday evening, the group remained stranded. Among those stuck was a seven-month-old child. Their guide allegedly deserted them, taking a lift out with another vehicle. By 7pm, no relief had come.With no mobile network to summon help, tourist Mohit hailed another vehicle returning from a trip. There's room for only one. He reached the main gate and begged for help. At the chowki, staff told him it wasn't their responsibility.PollWhat is your opinion on the guide's responsibility in this incident?The guide should be held accountable.The guide should not be blamed.A Canter driver allegedly demanded full payment before agreeing to assist.Rescue finally arrived around 7.45pm. The replacement Canter had no working headlights. The driver steered through the jungle with a torch. Children cried as the forest went pitch black. An audio recording of a woman tourist's call, made after she reached safety, recounted the ordeal. "Fortunately, no wild animal appeared," she said. Ranthambore is home to 70 tigers and about 130 leopards.The broken Canter may have spared its passengers a brush with the wild - but it left the national park's safari system fully exposed. A senior official said Sunday the truck broke down during the evening safari. Another Canter, meant to be on standby at the chowki, was absent. A third Canter, which had already returned, was instructed to bring the marooned group but failed to follow orders. Forest department banned all three Canter drivers and the accompanying guide until further orders. An inquiry has been ordered, with the assistant conservator of forests (tourism) directed to submit a report in three days.The department also reviewed the age and condition of safari vehicles. Ranthambore currently has 556 registered vehicles for tourism: 269 Gypsies and 287 Canters. Authorised vehicles are either locally owned and registered with the forest department or department-owned, with private operators managing bookings.Hoteliers and conservation stakeholders warned that many Canters are in rundown condition. "Some owners avoid spending on maintenance... expecting the vehicles will be phased out," a tour operator said Monday.

Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla calls on PM Modi at his 7, Lok Kalyan Marg residence on Monday NEW DELHI: Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, the first Indian astronaut to go to the International Space Station (ISS), was embraced by PM Narendra Modi when the country’s spaceman called on him at his 7, Lok Kalyan Marg residence after his successful mission to space.Shukla aka Shux, who arrived in India on Sunday from the US, was patted on the back by the PM for successfully piloting the Axiom-4 mission. He shared pictures of the Earth clicked from ISS with the PM and also shared his experience about the mission and zero-gravity experiments he did in space with Modi.After his one-to-one meet, Modi posted on X, “Had a great interaction with Shubhanshu Shukla. We discussed a wide range of subjects including his experiences in space, progress in science & technology as well as India's ambitious Gaganyaan mission. India is proud of his feat.”A day before, Shukla, who returned from the US after an 18-day space mission on ISS, was given a warm welcome at the IGI airport by space minister Jitendra Singh, Delhi CM Rekha Gupta and a large crowd waving the national flag.Earlier in the day, Parliament honoured the IAF pilot-turned Indian astronaut. The discussion was filled with praise and a strong sense of national pride, even as opposition parties staged a boycott. “Shubhanshu Shukla’s space travel and safe return is not just a successful mission, but a moment of pride for the entire nation and inspiration for the youth,” LS Speaker Om Birla said. Parliament described Shukla’s achievement as a new chapter in India’s space exploration, noting that it not only advanced homegrown science but also inspired a generation of young Indians to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and space.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous'Coolie' actress Rachita Ram's most gorgeous picturesEntertainmentPreity Mukhundhan radiates eleganceEntertainmentNeha Harsora’s dazzling and dreamy ethnic lookstvBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning weekend looks of the contestantstvFun facts about the Param Sundari actor Sidharth MalhotraEntertainment8 simple habits that will help reduce stress on the eyes and improve vision naturallyLifestyle8 times Samantha Ruth Prabhu turned perfect muse for Krésha BajajLifestyleSaree tales by actress Nisha RavikrishnantvManasi Parekh Serves Style & SmilesEntertainment10 celebrity-inspired Indian baby boy namesLifestyle Next123 Photostories  10 lesser known health benefits of eating cardamomWhy Ganga aarti is performed every evening: Understanding its spiritual significanceHow to make Chia Seed and Coconut Oil hair mask for quick hair growthBrown bread vs multigrain bread vs white bread, which is worse?Power passports: Citizens of these 5 countries can enter 185+ nations visa-free or on arrivalHow to build a timeless wardrobe inspired by Meryl StreepMovies that capture the strength of smiling through painHigh uric acid levels linked to high BP, diabetes and heart disease: Early symptoms to watch forWorld Photography Day 2025: Explore India’s most photogenic Blue Flag beachesIncredible India: Know all about the pride and joy of Puneri Pagadis123Hot PicksCP RadhakrishnanMumbai RainsHurricane Erin 2025Brooklyn Nightclub ShootingMarco RubioCrimeaBank Holidays AugustTop TrendingPatrick MahomesAntonio BrownRaheem MorrisJoy TaylorTravis Hunters WifeOlivia Paige DunneMartina NavratilovaMarco BelinelliPatrick MahomesTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteHow 'India’s secrets' helped Shubhanshu Shukla in space: Astronaut shares experience with PM Modi - WatchWhy should one pay to spend 12 hours in traffic jams?

The apex court is likely to hear the plea this week.In June, the HC had directed the Centre to resume the rural employment programme in the state from Aug 1, saying the scheme could not be "put in cold storage for eternity". The scheme has been suspended in Bengal for nearly three years, with the Centre blocking the funds due to alleged irregularities and non-compliance with its directives.Refusing to buy the Centre's argument on fake job card holders, Chief Justice T S Sivagnanam had said, "A person who obtained wages illegally or under fictitious names could not go free and had to be dealt with firmly.

"Has any database been compiled to show how many youngsters who turned 18 on the qualifying date were included?"Stalin voiced apprehension that procedures for enquiry and two appeals under Registration of Electors Rules, 1960, may exclude a huge number of voters in the impending Bihar polls. "Is EC going to address this issue? Will EC take these practical difficulties into account while conducting SIR in other states," he asked.The CM demanded that EC scrap SIR in other states, particularly Tamil Nadu, and urged DMK functionaries to be wary of addition or deletion of voters in the state ahead of the assembly polls next year.Stalin reminded EC about a DMK petition of July 17 seeking deletion of deceased voters. "When will this be done?" he asked. He wondered what prevented EC from enlisting Aadhaar as an acceptable documents to prove a voter's claims. "If free and fair elections are truly EC's aim, why can't it be more transparent and voter-friendly?"End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousPreity Mukhundhan radiates eleganceEntertainmentNeha Harsora’s dazzling and dreamy ethnic lookstvBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning weekend looks of the contestantstvFun facts about the Param Sundari actor Sidharth MalhotraEntertainment8 simple habits that will help reduce stress on the eyes and improve vision naturallyLifestyle8 times Samantha Ruth Prabhu turned perfect muse for Krésha BajajLifestyleSaree tales by actress Nisha RavikrishnantvManasi Parekh Serves Style & SmilesEntertainment10 celebrity-inspired Indian baby boy namesLifestyle10 animals that look like they are hand paintedLifestyle Next123 Photostories  How to build a timeless wardrobe inspired by Meryl StreepMovies that capture the strength of smiling through painHigh uric acid levels linked to high BP, diabetes and heart disease: Early symptoms to watch forWorld Photography Day 2025: Explore India’s most photogenic Blue Flag beachesIncredible India: Know all about the pride and joy of Puneri PagadisUrvashi Rautela turns heads with glamorous outfitBig-city girl reunites with first love in timeless Bollywood romanceKajol’s entry redefined the idea of a heroine on screenBigg Boss Telugu 9: Meet the judges of the pre-show, “Agnipariksha”Jab We Met, Bareilly Ki Barfi, Mujhse Shaadi Karogi: Binge these rom-com hits on OTT before Param Sundari123Hot PicksCP RadhakrishnanMumbai RainsHurricane Erin 2025Brooklyn Nightclub ShootingMarco RubioCrimeaBank Holidays AugustTop TrendingPatrick MahomesAntonio BrownRaheem MorrisJoy TaylorTravis Hunters WifeOlivia Paige DunneMartina NavratilovaMarco BelinelliPatrick MahomesTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteAsked to break up, Bihar couple dies by suicideFlyer arrested in Chennai for smoking onboardSC skeptical about involving HC CJ in state DGP selectionHC sees red as Assam hands over 3k bigha of land to cement companyHusband taking part in selection of AMU's 1st woman VC not proper: SCEx-Kashmir bar prez charged under UAPANoel Tata’s mother and former Tata Group director Simone Tata in critical conditionIntent to drive a person to death must for abetment conviction: SCGovt orders schools' safety audits, directs demolition of unsafe buildingsUnemployment rate slows to 5.2% in July: PLFS dataIndia Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Shubman Gill dilemma - Selectors face tough call ahead of Asia Cup squad announcementRow over Indian-origin truck driver Harjinder Singh: California Guv's office says he entered US under Trump presidency'Scared to go back to India': Truck driver Harjinder Singh who killed 3 in Florida was allowed to stay in US in 2018 on $5,000 bondStephen Curry’s wife Ayesha Curry shares an unforgettable moment of baby Cai walking on his dad’s footstepsVanessa Bryant finally breaks silence on wild pregnancy rumors with a wild response featuring a Rihanna meme'If you are trying to brain-drain Bangalore...': US economist's H-1B explanation goes viralAre Travis Hunter and Leanna Lenee really divorcing?

To this, CJI Gavai asked, "To what extent does the SC have the competence to go beyond legislation enacted by states for selection of DGPs? If the HC CJ is made part of the selection process, which is part of the executive's function, would it not breach constitutionally mandated separation of powers between legislature, executive and judiciary?"The SC rejected contempt pleas against Jharkhand for appointing Anurag Gupta as DGP.

HC sees red as Assam hands over 3k bigha of land to cement company

Gauhati HC GUWAHATI: A contentious mining lease granted to a private cement company for 3,000 bighas (4.01 sq km) in Assam's Dima Hasao district led an incredulous Gauhati high court judge to question on camera if it was "some kind of joke or what" that "public interest" had been sacrificed at the altar of business."The entire district? What is going on? 3,000 bighas allotted to a private company? What kind of decision is this?" Justice Sanjay Kumar Medhi is heard saying in courtroom footage, seemingly taken aback by a counsel's submission on the parcel of land at stake. When the lawyer representing Mahabal Cement Ltd argues that the disputed area near Umrangso "is barren land", Justice Medhi interjects, "We know how barren is NC Hills (Dima Hasao's erstwhile name)." Seconds later, the judge is seen rebuking the lawyer again just as she picks up a sheaf of documents in preparation for further arguments."No, no, your lordship, we need it (the land). It's because of..." the counsel says before Justice Medhi interrupts her."Your need is not the issue, madam. Public interest is the issue," the judge says.The high court was hearing two petitions - one filed by Dima Hasao resident Sonesh Hojai and 21 others against the state govt and Mahabal Cement Ltd, and another by the company against the state govt and 10 others. Dima Hasao, one among six tribal-dominant districts of the state, is a biodiverse region famous for its hot springs, forests, migratory bird habitats and wildlife. As mandated by the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, an elected autonomous council administers the district.Justice Medhi has directed the North Cachar Hills Autonomous Council's standing counsel, C Sarma, to "obtain records containing the policy to allot such a huge chunk of land to a factory" and submit these to the court at the next hearing. "The direction has been given by taking into account that the district is a 6th Scheduled district under the Constitution of India, where the priority has to be given to the rights and interest of the tribal people residing there," stated the order.A video of the judge's exchange with the company's lawyer has been widely shared on social media.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousPreity Mukhundhan radiates eleganceEntertainmentNeha Harsora’s dazzling and dreamy ethnic lookstvBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning weekend looks of the contestantstvFun facts about the Param Sundari actor Sidharth MalhotraEntertainment8 simple habits that will help reduce stress on the eyes and improve vision naturallyLifestyle8 times Samantha Ruth Prabhu turned perfect muse for Krésha BajajLifestyleSaree tales by actress Nisha RavikrishnantvManasi Parekh Serves Style & SmilesEntertainment10 celebrity-inspired Indian baby boy namesLifestyle10 animals that look like they are hand paintedLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Movies that capture the strength of smiling through painHigh uric acid levels linked to high BP, diabetes and heart disease: Early symptoms to watch forWorld Photography Day 2025: Explore India’s most photogenic Blue Flag beachesIncredible India: Know all about the pride and joy of Puneri PagadisUrvashi Rautela turns heads with glamorous outfitBig-city girl reunites with first love in timeless Bollywood romanceKajol’s entry redefined the idea of a heroine on screenBigg Boss Telugu 9: Meet the judges of the pre-show, “Agnipariksha”Jab We Met, Bareilly Ki Barfi, Mujhse Shaadi Karogi: Binge these rom-com hits on OTT before Param Sundari'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' to 'Annabelle': Horror movies to binge watch on OTT before 'The Conjuring: Last Rites' releases123Hot PicksCP RadhakrishnanMumbai RainsHurricane Erin 2025Brooklyn Nightclub ShootingMarco RubioCrimeaBank Holidays AugustTop TrendingPatrick MahomesAntonio BrownRaheem MorrisJoy TaylorTravis Hunters WifeOlivia Paige DunneMartina NavratilovaMarco BelinelliPatrick MahomesTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteIndia Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Shubman Gill dilemma - Selectors face tough call ahead of Asia Cup squad announcementRow over Indian-origin truck driver Harjinder Singh: California Guv's office says he entered US under Trump presidency'Scared to go back to India': Truck driver Harjinder Singh who killed 3 in Florida was allowed to stay in US in 2018 on $5,000 bondStephen Curry’s wife Ayesha Curry shares an unforgettable moment of baby Cai walking on his dad’s footstepsVanessa Bryant finally breaks silence on wild pregnancy rumors with a wild response featuring a Rihanna meme'If you are trying to brain-drain Bangalore...': US economist's H-1B explanation goes viralAre Travis Hunter and Leanna Lenee really divorcing?

Husband taking part in selection of AMU's 1st woman VC not proper: SC
The Supreme Court questioned the selection process of Naima Khatoon as AMU's VC, highlighting her husband's involvement as improper. Despite Allahabad HC's disapproval but eventual upholding of her selection, the apex court raised concerns about fairness. The hearing was adjourned due to Justice Chandran's recusal, while arguments continued regarding the validity of the selection process and potential manipulation.

Despite Allahabad HC's disapproval but eventual upholding of her selection, the apex court raised concerns about fairness. The hearing was adjourned due to Justice Chandran's recusal, while arguments continued regarding the validity of the selection process and potential manipulation.  NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday made adverse comments on the selection process that led to the appointment of Naima Khatoon as the first woman vice-chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), saying the participation of her husband Mohd Gulrez, the officiating vice-chancellor, in the process was not proper.A bench of CJI Bhushan R Gavai and Justices K Vinod Chandran and N V Anjaria said, "Certainly, the husband's participation in the selection process is not proper when his wife is a candidate. He should have recused and made his deputy participate in it. The selection process should not only be fair but also appear to be fair".The remarks came on appeals filed against a judgment of Allahabad HC, which too had disapproved of the participation of Khatoon's husband in the selection process, but upheld her selection by the President, who is the visitor of the university, as the vice-chancellor of AMU. Appearing for the petitioners, senior advocate Kapil Sibal explained how voting in the executive council was tailored to insert Khatoon's name into the panel of five names - Faizan Mustafa, Qayyum Husain, Muzaffar Uruj Rabbani and Furqan Qamar were the other candidates - for the purpose. When these names were placed before the AMU Court (Senate), Rabbani got 61 votes, Mustafa, 50 votes, and Khatoon, 50 votes. These three names were sent to the President of India, who chose Khatoon as VC, and she was appointed to the post in Apr last year.Despite the CJI's adverse comments, the court adjourned the hearing as Justice Chandran recused himself, on the ground that as chancellor he had recommended the appointment of Faizan Mustafa as the VC of Chanakya National Law University, Patna.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said Justice Chandran need not recuse himself as the parties had full faith in him. He held that Gulrez's participation in the selection process did not affect the sanctity of Prof Khatoon's appointment as AMU VC as her name was included in the panel of three names by the AMU Court.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati told the bench that the selection process had followed the rules and regulations scrupulously and that the high court, after examining the allegations, had upheld her appointment as the AMU vice-chancellor. Sibal said he had no issues with the Visitor's choice, but if the allegations of manipulation were examined and found true, then Khatoon's name would not have figured on the list of five names forwarded to the AMU court by the executive council.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousPreity Mukhundhan radiates eleganceEntertainmentNeha Harsora’s dazzling and dreamy ethnic lookstvBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning weekend looks of the contestantstvFun facts about the Param Sundari actor Sidharth MalhotraEntertainment8 simple habits that will help reduce stress on the eyes and improve vision naturallyLifestyle8 times Samantha Ruth Prabhu turned perfect muse for Krésha BajajLifestyleSaree tales by actress Nisha RavikrishnantvManasi Parekh Serves Style & SmilesEntertainment10 celebrity-inspired Indian baby boy namesLifestyle10 animals that look like they are hand paintedLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Movies that capture the strength of smiling through painHigh uric acid levels linked to high BP, diabetes and heart disease: Early symptoms to watch forWorld Photography Day 2025: Explore India’s most photogenic Blue Flag beachesIncredible India: Know all about the pride and joy of Puneri PagadisUrvashi Rautela turns heads with glamorous outfitBig-city girl reunites with first love in timeless Bollywood romanceKajol’s entry redefined the idea of a heroine on screenBigg Boss Telugu 9: Meet the judges of the pre-show, “Agnipariksha”Jab We Met, Bareilly Ki Barfi, Mujhse Shaadi Karogi: Binge these rom-com hits on OTT before Param Sundari'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' to 'Annabelle': Horror movies to binge watch on OTT before 'The Conjuring: Last Rites' releases123Hot PicksCP RadhakrishnanMumbai RainsHurricane Erin 2025Brooklyn Nightclub ShootingMarco RubioCrimeaBank Holidays AugustTop TrendingPatrick MahomesAntonio BrownRaheem MorrisJoy TaylorTravis Hunters WifeOlivia Paige DunneMartina NavratilovaMarco BelinelliPatrick MahomesTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteEx-Kashmir bar prez charged under UAPANoel Tata’s mother and former Tata Group director Simone Tata in critical conditionIntent to drive a person to death must for abetment conviction: SCGovt orders schools' safety audits, directs demolition of unsafe buildingsUnemployment rate slows to 5.2% in July: PLFS dataGovt moves to expedite green nod for mining critical mineralsNehru signed IWT without consulting Parliament: NaddaBill in LS to tag IIM-G 'institute of national importance'China & India should meet each other halfway: BeijingPutin, Modi reaffirm vow to strengthen bilateral tiesRow over Indian-origin truck driver Harjinder Singh: California Guv's office says he entered US under Trump presidency'Scared to go back to India': Truck driver Harjinder Singh who killed 3 in Florida was allowed to stay in US in 2018 on $5,000 bondStephen Curry’s wife Ayesha Curry shares an unforgettable moment of baby Cai walking on his dad’s footstepsVanessa Bryant finally breaks silence on wild pregnancy rumors with a wild response featuring a Rihanna meme'If you are trying to brain-drain Bangalore...': US economist's H-1B explanation goes viralAre Travis Hunter and Leanna Lenee really divorcing?

She was flown from Dubai to Mumbai. Doctor Farokh Udwadia is attending to her. Simone, 95, has Parkinson's symptoms. She transformed Lakme into a famous brand. She created Westside after Lakme's sale. She managed Tata's consumer businesses for four decades. Noel succeeded Ratan at Tata Trusts. Simone Tata made a rare public appearance at the launch of the revamped flagship Westside store in South Mumbai in October 2019. MUMBAI: Simone Tata, the mother of Tata Trusts chairman Noel Tata, is in critical condition at the Breach Candy Hospital, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told TOI. She was airlifted from Dubai to Mumbai on Monday and is under the care of doctor Farokh Udwadia. Simone, 95, is fighting several symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, the same illness that her stepson and former Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata passed away from last October. “She and Noel arrived in Mumbai from Dubai on a medical plane at Terminal 8,” the sources said. Simone is most famous for turning the Lakmé cosmetic brand into a well-known household name in India. The name Lakmé comes from the French word for Lakshmi, a goddess known for her beauty in Hindu mythology. The Tata Group was urged by former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to launch a makeup brand after learning that Indian women were spending the country’s foreign reserves on Western makeup brands. Lakmé was established by the Tata Group in 1952. Originally from Geneva, Switzerland, Simone first visited India as a tourist in the summer of 1953 at the age of 23. During her visit, she met Naval Tata, who was 26 years her senior and divorced from his first wife Soonoo. They fell in love, got married in 1955, and she decided to make Mumbai her permanent home. In 1996, the Tata Group sold Lakmé to Hindustan Unilever as part of a restructuring strategy. Simone used the proceeds from the sale to create Westside, a popular department store where many Indians shop. She managed the Tata Group’s consumer-facing businesses including Lakme and Trent (which owns Westside and Star India Bazaar stores) for over four decades until her retirement in 2006. She also served on the board of Tata Industries, an important investment company within the Tata Group. After her retirement, Simone made fewer public appearances. In October 2019, she was seen in a wheelchair at the opening of the renovated flagship Westside store in South Mumbai. In September 2022, she attended the funeral of former Tata Group chairman Cyrus Mistry (Noel is married to Cyrus’s sister Aloo Mistry), and in October 2024, she was present at Ratan’s funeral.Following Ratan’s passing, Noel took over his position at Tata Trusts, the driving force behind the $180-billion Tata Group.About the AuthorReeba ZachariahReeba Zachariah is assistant corporate editor at The Times of India, Mumbai.

Why do air disasters keep happening in African skies?
Recent fatal crashes in Africa have spotlighted critical issues within the continent's aviation sector, including pilot training, regulatory enforcement, and maintenance standards. Experts attribute these incidents to human error, systemic negligence, and increasingly unpredictable weather patterns exacerbated by climate change. Calls are growing for stricter adherence to international standards and improved government oversight to enhance safety and restore public trust.

Experts attribute these incidents to human error, systemic negligence, and increasingly unpredictable weather patterns exacerbated by climate change. Calls are growing for stricter adherence to international standards and improved government oversight to enhance safety and restore public trust. ANI file photo  In recent months, Africa's skies have been under intense scrutiny as a series of fatal crashes have raised questions over pilot training, regulatory enforcement, maintenance standards, weather preparedness and other key issues pertaining to the safety of the continent's aviation industry.On August 6, a Harbin Z-9EH military helicopter used by Ghana's air force slammed into a forested mountainside in the southern Ashanti Region, killing all eight passengers, including Defence Minister Edward Omane Boamah, Environment and Science Minister Ibrahim Murtala Muhammed as well as other senior political and security figures.Just one day later, this tragedy was overshadowed by another crash, when a Cessna air ambulance operated by AMREF Flying Doctors in Kenya crashed into a residential area near the capital Nairobi shortly after takeoff, claiming six lives — four on board and two on the ground.In January, a chartered Beechcraft 1900D carrying oil workers from South Sudan's Unity State to the capital Juba went down just minutes after departure from the GPOC Unity Airstrip in Rubkona County, killing all 21 on board.In June 2024, Malawi lost Vice-President Saulos Chilima and former First Lady Patricia Shanil Muluzi to another fatal crash when a Malawi Defence Force Dornier 228 plane plunged into the Chikangawa Forest Reserve en route to the city of Mzuzu, causing nine fatalities.Growing reports of severe turbulence incidents, which have left multiple passengers injured during civilian flights, have also intensified the attention towards African aviation.Human error — and hubrisIndustry experts say the machines themselves are not the problem, stressing that human error, systemic negligence, an insufficient safety culture, and increasingly unpredictable weather patterns are the factors that, over time, have resulted in this worrying track record."Airplanes are faithful machines. They are built to serve. They are built so well that [they're] loaded with a lot of redundant components in such a way that before anything goes wrong, the airplane faithfully tells the pilots and the engineers at every point in time," Nigerian aviation consultant Godwin Ike told DW, highlighting the abundance of backup systems in modern planes and helicopters.In his view, aircraft will typically only "fall out of the skies because human operators can be very unfaithful and more often than not, horribly dishonest."According to Ike, there's a certain element of human pride that can still get in the way of otherwise perfectly operational aircraft. Ike insists that taking simple actions like refusing take-off when automated systems detect a fault can make all the difference between life and death, adding that adhering to regular maintenance schedules are also just as important."Turn that plane in for maintenance that is due. In that way, you can be guaranteed usage without any issues," he said, adding this is not a form of weakness but safety in action.Mind the weatherFor Felicity Ahafianyo, the head of Ghana's Central Analysis and Forecast Office, the greater danger is less about preparedness and reaction on the ground but rather in the skies. She warns that climate change has affected weather patterns in the higher levels of the atmosphere across the globe, making certain hazards less predictable."When it comes to aviation industry, weather is a key factor. The first part has to do with the convective activities. That's the formation of thunderstorm clouds. Another one has to do with visibility. Another one has to do with the wind shear. Some areas are getting more rainfall more than usual," she said."Apart from the convective activities that affect the aircraft operations, there is clear weather turbulence or clear air turbulence, which also affects aircraft operations."Ahafianyo's team provides helicopters with various, crucial information for the safe and proper operation of aircraft. This includes "the vertical profile of the atmosphere from flight level 600 up to 12,000 feet high in the sky, the tropical boundary locations for the day," and "if there could be any shears that may disturb their operations."But not every pilot listens, she says: "I was once an aviation forecaster, and could see that some pilots don't care about the weather." When faced with persistent weather problems, Ike argued, pilots should head to "the nearest airport, and announce that they want to do an emergency landing."However, he added that sometimes pilots decided to follow this standard protocol too late — especially when transporting government ministers and other influential leaders, whose time may appear to be too precious for an emergency landing and interruption of the trip.Africa's negligence of international standardsThe two analysts highlighted that the recent crashes also exposed deeper political and regulatory failings.Weak government oversight, an inconsistent safety culture, and growing economic pressures from rising fuel prices as well as the high cost of obtaining spare parts all combined to create ever growing risks.Ike also said that while the issue of human error in the cockpit must be addressed, the problem of human negligence on the ground might be even greater.Until Africa's aviation industry caught up to the highest air traffic standards, he said, pilots must be told to treat every mechanical alert and each weather warning as an instruction, not a suggestion.International aviation bodies meanwhile have also repeatedly urged African governments to strengthen the enforcement of their safety standards and to better adapt to growing climate volatility, as each crash further erodes public trust.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousTaarak Mehta’s Sunayana Fozdar’s top 10 ethnic lookstv'Coolie' actress Rachita Ram's most gorgeous picturesEntertainmentPreity Mukhundhan radiates eleganceEntertainmentNeha Harsora’s dazzling and dreamy ethnic lookstvBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning weekend looks of the contestantstvFun facts about the Param Sundari actor Sidharth MalhotraEntertainment8 simple habits that will help reduce stress on the eyes and improve vision naturallyLifestyle8 times Samantha Ruth Prabhu turned perfect muse for Krésha BajajLifestyleSaree tales by actress Nisha RavikrishnantvManasi Parekh Serves Style & SmilesEntertainment Next123 Photostories  When Bollywood dared to break silence on social injusticeFrom 68.5 to 55 kg in Just 45 Days: Sunita Gogoi shares the discipline behind her 13 kg weight loss journeySmiles replace tensions as Zelenskyy visits Trump: EU, Nato leaders rally at White House - photos10 lesser known health benefits of eating cardamomWhy Ganga aarti is performed every evening: Understanding its spiritual significanceHow to make Chia Seed and Coconut Oil hair mask for quick hair growthBrown bread vs multigrain bread vs white bread, which is worse?Power passports: Citizens of these 5 countries can enter 185+ nations visa-free or on arrivalHow to build a timeless wardrobe inspired by Meryl StreepMovies that capture the strength of smiling through pain123Hot PicksCP RadhakrishnanMumbai RainsHurricane Erin 2025Brooklyn Nightclub ShootingMarco RubioCrimeaBank Holidays AugustTop TrendingPatrick MahomesAntonio BrownRaheem MorrisJoy TaylorTravis Hunters WifeOlivia Paige DunneMartina NavratilovaMarco BelinelliPatrick MahomesTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire Website‘Not a great day’: Donald Trump displays artwork of Butler attack to European leaders - videoUS crackdown on foreign students: Over 6,000 visas revoked this year;

According to a department official, the visas were revoked because individuals either overstayed their permits or violated US laws. The “vast majority” of the legal violations involved assault, driving under the influence, burglary, and “support for terrorism.” Of the more than 6,000 revocations, about 4,000 were linked to criminal offenses. Secretary of state Marco Rubio said in an interview with EWTN in early August that a student visa is not a constitutional right.“There is no constitutional right to a student visa. A student visa is something we decide to give you. Visas of every kind are denied every day all over the world. As I speak to you now, someone’s visa application to the US is being denied. So, if I would have denied you a visa had I known something about you, and I find out afterwards that I gave you a visa and I found this out about you, why wouldn’t I be able to revoke your visa?”Between 200 and 300 visas were canceled over alleged terrorism under provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that bar foreign nationals from entry due to “terrorist related activities”, CNN reported. The revocations came as the Trump administration escalated its scrutiny of universities and student visa programs. Officials particularly focused on international students participating in protests against the war in Gaza, accusing them of antisemitism and supporting terrorism. In one high-profile case, Tufts University PhD student Rumeysa Ozturk’s visa was canceled. She was detained by masked federal agents in March and placed in ICE custody, before a judge ordered her release in May. In June, the State Department instructed embassies and consulates to more closely vet student visa applicants for “hostile attitudes towards our citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles.” Applicants were asked to make their social media profiles public as part of the process.  According to the State Department, roughly 400,000 F1 student visas were issued in fiscal year 2024.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

CSIS had posted on its official X handle “Back in June, CSIS launched its #PrideSeason celebrations with a few guest speakers. Thanks to the talented Two-spirit hoop dancer Makhena Ranken Guerin, the hilarious Canadian comedienne Ava Val, and inspirational public servant David Da Silva...”The post quickly sparked an outpouring of critical remarks online. Some commentators seized on the juxtaposition of a national security agency engaging in Pride celebrations, ridiculing the blend of intelligence work with performative inclusivity. Some social-media users mockingly reacted that CSIS had “gone full rainbow”. Others said such initiatives risked trivializing the gravity of national security concerns.Observers noted that the intelligence agency had been increasingly active on social media platforms, engaging publicly and actively sharing cultural moments.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The moment was captured on video, which circulated widely on social media, and quickly garnered views with many users reacting to the gesture. While some described it as the “Modi effect,” others highlighted the growing camaraderie between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Italian leader. This was not the first time Meloni used the gesture. Earlier, at the G7 Summit in Italy, she was also seen welcoming world leaders with a “namaste.” Her interactions with PM Modi have repeatedly sparked conversations online on several occasions. The Italian prime minister was in Washington on the invitation of US President Donald Trump for a multilateral meeting. Other attendees included European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine amidst the Russia-Ukraine war. At the meeting, Meloni thanked Trump while noting Russia’s willingness to discuss ways to end the conflict. “I think it is an important day, a new phase, after three years ... [when] we didn't see any kind of sign from the Russian side, that there [is] a willingness for dialogue,” she said. “So something is changing. Something has changed.”Read | 'Putin wants to make a deal for me': Donald Trump heard whispering to Emmanuel Macron; reveals Russia’s ceasefire intentionAbout the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Donald Trump and Ursula von der Leyen discussed the global problem of missing children, emphasizing reunification efforts. Melania Trump's letter urged Putin to protect Ukrainian children and restore their laughter. ANI file photo  Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday expressed his gratitude to US First Lady Melania Trump for penning a “peace letter” to Russian president Vladimir Putin, addressing the abduction of Ukrainian children.Zelenskyy said the abductions highlighted one of the most “painful and difficult issues” of the conflict and reaffirmed his commitment to pursuing an “all-for-all” exchange of prisoners of war.“I want to thank @FLOTUS Melania Trump for her attention to one of the most painful and difficult issues of this war, the abduction of Ukrainian children by Russia. We deeply appreciate her compassion and her letter to Putin,” Zelenskyy said through a post on X.‘This issue lies at the heart of the war’s humanitarian tragedy, our children, broken families, the pain of separation. At least 20,000 children were taken,” Zelenskyy said. He added that he gave US president Donald Trump a letter from Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, to be passed on to Melania Trump.“Her (Melania's) voice matters, and her care gives strength to this cause,” Zelenskyy added.The Ukrainian president said the government continued efforts to secure the return of children, as well as prisoners of war and civilians held in Russia. Some of those detainees, he noted, have been imprisoned since 2014.“Thousands of people still need to be freed – and this is a part of making peace. We will work to negotiate all-for-all prisoners of war exchange, and we are grateful to have strong friends who help,” Zelenskyy said.Zelenskyy’s comments came after Trump said on Tuesday that he and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen discussed the “massive worldwide problem of missing children.” Trump described the issue as a priority and said efforts would be made to reunite children with their families."Ursula von der Leyen, the distinguished and highly respected president of the European Commission, and I have been discussing the massive worldwide problem of missing children. This is, likewise, a big subject with my wife, Melania. It is a subject at the top of all lists, and the world will work together to solve it, hopefully bringing them home to their families!" Trump said through a post on Truth Social.Melania Trump penned a letter on August 15 addressed to Putin and urged him to act to protect Ukrainian children, saying he could restore their laughter and safeguard their innocence."Such a bold idea transcends all human division, and you, Mr Putin, are fit to implement this vision with a stroke of the pen today," the letter read. "It is time."Zelenskyy’s talks with the US president came shortly after Trump met Putin over the weekend. European leaders also gathered in Washington to express solidarity with Ukraine and press to bolster security guarantees in any post-war framework.Participants included Trump, Zelenskyy, UK prime minister Keir Starmer, French president Emmanuel Macron, Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni, German chancellor Friedrich Merz, Finnish president Alexander Stubb, Nato secretary general Mark Rutte, and Ursula von der Leyen.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Trump hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and seven European leaders, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, Nato secretary general Mark Rutte, and European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen. During the meeting, a hot mic inadvertently caught audio of Trump whispering to Emmanuel Macron during the meeting.“I think he [Russian President Vladimir Putin] wants to make a deal,” Trump said. “I think he wants to make a deal for me, you understand that? As crazy as it sounds,” the New York Post reported.The remark suggested that Trump believed Putin was inclined to strike an agreement, offering further insight into his assessment of his recent talks with the Russian leader. Trump had met Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday. Both leaders described the meeting in positive terms, but no formal agreement or signed deal was announced. Trump stated, “We had an extremely productive meeting, and many points were agreed to,” while adding, “We didn’t get there.” Addressing reporters, he remarked, “There’s no deal until there’s a deal.” Trump and special presidential envoy Steve Witkoff, who also participated in the Alaska summit, claimed that they had secured Putin’s agreement to allow US and other NATO forces to come to Ukraine’s defense should Moscow violate any terms of a potential peace arrangement. Following Monday’s consultations with Zelenskyy and European leaders, Trump said he called Putin to begin preparing a direct meeting between the two warring sides, which would be followed by a trilateral session including the US president.

Alexander Stubb: Finnish President Alexander Stubb praised US President Donald Trump for the progress made in talks to resolve Russia’s war in Ukraine. “I think in the past two weeks, we’ve probably had more progress in ending this war than we have in the past three and a half years,” he said today, pointing to the symbolic nature of the leaders gathering to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine.Friedrich Merz: German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the path is open for more serious negotiations to be held on the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. “I can’t imagine that the next meeting will take place without a ceasefire,” he said. “So let’s work on that.”Mark Rutte: “The fact that you have said ‘I am willing to participate in the security guarantees’ is a big step, it’s really a breakthrough, and it makes all the difference. So also thank you for that,” Nato secretary general Mark Rutte said to Trump. Emmanuel Macron: French president Emmanuel Macron said a European leader should be at the table when Trump, Zelenskyy, Putin sit for the next meeting. “I think as a follow up, we would need probably a quadrilateral meeting. Because when we speak about security guarantees, we speak about the whole security of the European continent,” he said.Giorgia Meloni: Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni thanks Trump for Russia's willingness to talk about ending the war. "I think it is an important day, a new phase, after three years ... [when] we didn't see any kind of sign from the Russian side, that there [is] a willingness for dialogue," she said.

Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem said the death of three people in Florida caused by a semi truck's wrong U-turn was a gut-wrenching tragedy which should have never happened. Noem said DHS will work with the US Department of Transportation to ensure that illegal aliens do not get licenses from sanctuary jurisdictions. "3 innocent people were killed in Florida because Gavin Newsom’s California DMV issued an illegal alien a Commercial Driver’s License. This gut wrenching tragedy should have never happened," Noem posted."Three innocent people were killed in Florida because Gavin Newsom’s California DMV issued an illegal alien a Commercial Driver’s License—this state of governance is asinine," DHS said in a statement."How many more innocent people have to die before Gavin Newsom stops playing games with the safety of the American public? We pray for the victims and their families. Secretary Noem and DHS are working around the clock to protect the public and get these criminal illegal aliens out of America," the statement added.Florida accident: Why DHS fighting with California Harjinder Singh, the driver of the semi that took a wrong U-turn and caused the deaths of three people who were in their vehicle, got his driving license in California. As California is Democratic ruled, the Trump administration and Governor Gavin Newsom's office started passing the buck on one another for the tragedy. While DHS blamed California for giving a driver's license to the illegal alien, Newsom's office said Singh entered the US in 2018 when Trump was the president. Did Harjinder Singh enter US illegally in 2018?DHS confirmed that Harjinder Singh entered the US illegally through the southern border in 2018 and was arrested within two days. But he said he was scared to go back to India -- a fear that was affirmed by US Citizenship and Immigration Services. At that time, he was released on a $5,000 immigration bond. His immigration proceedings remained pending since then but he managed to get a driver's license in California. California's Assembly Bill 60 (AB 60), enacted in 2015, allows undocumented immigrants to apply for a driver's license if they can provide proof of identity and California residency. These licenses are marked "not for federal identification."About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Instead of photos of Ukrainian children suffering the war that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy brought to the White House in February, this time Zelenskyy brought a letter from Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska addressed to First Lady Melania Trump and offered it to Donald Trump at the beginning of their joint sit-down Monday. This was taking a leaf out of the recent example set by Trump himself who hand-delivered Melania's letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Zelenskyy praised the gesture and then took out the letter from his wife and specified that the letter was not meant for Trump. "Thank you very much for your efforts, personal efforts to stop the killings and stop this war," Zelenskyy said, adding that Melania's letter mentioned Ukraine's children. “My wife, the first lady of Ukraine, she gave the letter. It’s not to you but to your wife,” he said"I want," Trump said in his instant reaction.What Melania wrote in her letter to Trump"In today's world, some children are forced to carry a quiet laughter, untouched by the darkness around them," Melania wrote. "Mr Putin, you can singlehandedly restore their melodic laughter," it added. "In protecting the innocence of these children, you will do more than serve Russia alone -- you serve humanity itself.""Such a bold idea transcends all human division, and you, Mr Putin, are fit to implement this vision with a stroke of the pen today," the letter read. "It is time."During Monday's press conference, Trump spoke about Melania;s letter to Putin, urging him to protect children amid the push to end his war in Ukraine, and said it was “very well received” by the Russian leader. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, alongside Zelenskyy that Melania “loves children and she hates to see something like this happening.” “She would love to see this end,” Trump said. “She says it very openly, very proudly, and with great sorrow.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Smiling, the Ukrainian leader replied, “This is the best I had.”Zelenskyy, long known for his trademark military-style attire, surprised many by turning up in a black blazer over a buttoned black shirt.The lighter moment marked a contrast from both the leader’s February meeting, which had ended in tense exchanges.Back then, Trump poked fun at Zelenskyy’s military-style outfit, joking to reporters as Zelenskyy appeared in a black sweater, “Oh look, he’s all dressed up today!”During the press conference, Zelenskyy was questioned about why he never wears a suit. The reporter asked, "You're the highest level in this country's office and you refuse to wear a suit. Just want to see if you do own a suit."Zelenskyy pushed back, asking if the reporter had a problem with his outfit, and said, "I don't have such an office. I will wear costume after this war will finish. Yes. Maybe. Maybe something like yours. Yes. Maybe something better. I don't know. We will see. Maybe something cheaper than this."That earlier meeting had ended in heated exchanges, with Vice President JD Vance accusing Zelenskyy of being ungrateful for Trump’s peace efforts. However, both leaders have since shown willingness to ease tensions.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

(AP) The strike by over 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants entered its third day on Monday, leaving hundreds of thousands of passengers stranded amid the peak summer travel season. The Canada Industrial Relations Board (CIRB) had declared the stoppage illegal and ordered workers back to their posts, but the union has refused to comply. CUPE National President Mark Hancock, speaking at a briefing on Monday, signaled the union’s determination. “There's no limit. We're going to stay strong. We're going to stay committed to making sure that those workers can do the job they love doing and actually be able to afford a roof over their heads, to afford caring for their families,” he said. “And if it means folks like me going to jail, then so be it. If it means our union being fined, then so be it. We're looking for a solution here. Our members want a solution here. But that solution has to be found at a bargaining table.” Flight attendants walked off the job early Saturday after rejecting Air Canada’s request to enter government-directed arbitration, which would allow a third party to determine contract terms. Hancock publicly tore up a copy of the initial back-to-work order outside Toronto’s Pearson International Airport, to the cheers of picketing workers. Air Canada has warned staff that those defying the order may be held personally accountable. The airline suspended plans to restart operations Sunday evening after the union refused to return to work, affecting about 130,000 passengers daily. Prime Minister Mark Carney urged both sides to resolve the dispute quickly. “We are in a situation where literally hundreds of thousands of Canadians and visitors to our country are being disrupted by this action,” he said, emphasizing the need for fair compensation and a resolution. The union is demanding wages comparable to those at Air Transat and pay for work on the ground, such as boarding passengers. Air Canada’s offer included a 38% increase in total compensation over four years, but CUPE rejected it, citing insufficient first-year raises against inflation. With no immediate sign of compromise, the standoff is expected to continue, leaving passengers uncertain and the government weighing potential legal or legislative measures to end the strike.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

After Indian-origin truck driver Harjinder Singh killed three taking a wrong turn with his semi-truck in Florida, the Donald Trump administration dug out all his previous records and it's now confirmed that he was arrested by the Border Patrol two days after he illegally entered the country through California in 2018. Harjinder Singh's immigrant proceedings are pending following his arrest on September 20, 2018, said the Department of Homeland Security.When he was arrested in 2018, he was processed for expedited removal but he claimed at that time that he was scared to return to India. Fox News reported that his fear was affirmed by US Citizenship and Immigration Services and he was released on a $5,000 immigration bond. 3 killed on Florida TurnpikeSingh was arrested after three people were killed near Fort Pierce on the Florida Turnpike on August 12. All three of them were in a minivan. Two passengers, a 37-year-old woman from Pompano Beach and a 54-year-old man from Miami, died at the scene, and the driver, a 30-year-old man from Florida City, later died in the hospital.PollDo you think stricter immigration checks could prevent incidents like this?Yes, stronger checks are neededNo, other measures are more effectiveSingh was arrested by US Marshals in California on Saturday on a warrant for three counts of vehicular homicide in connection with a deadly crash in Florida, according to Fox News. Under Florida law, vehicular homicide is a second-degree felony, punishable by up to 15 years in prison.After the video recorded inside the semi-truck went viral, Indians were attacked for driving mishaps on US roads and after Singh was found to be an illegal alien from India, the incident became a major political flashpoint. DHS said Singh stated that he does not have a serious physical or mental medical condition, has "no known immediate relatives serving in the US military and is not the primary caretaker of a person with mental or physical disability, a minor or person with a serious illness." Singh is also unmarried, has no minor dependent children and is not a victim of domestic violence or human trafficking -- factors that could have stopped his immediate deportation. "After careful consideration of all factors and available records, Singh is considered a significant threat to public safety and is an exceptional circumstance warranting enforcement action due to the serious nature of his criminal history," DHS said.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

'If you are trying to brain-drain Bangalore...': US economist's H-1B explanation goes viral

American economist Peter St Onge's video explaining the H-1B system and what changes the Donald Trump administration is trying to bring is has gone viral as he summarized that the H-1B overhaul that Trump is planning will restore the visa program to what it was meant for and not brain-draining India's Bangalore to run IT sweatshop in the US, depriving American workers. "Will Americans who did learn to code get jobs?" the economist asked as the administration is planning to switch to a wage-based H-1B hiring which means companies will be allowed to hire only high-wage top talents from foreign countries. "JD Vance blasted companies that laid off Americans and then replaced them at half the price with H-1Bs. The administration now plans to return the program to its original purpose of bringing in top talent rather than running coding sweatshops that replace Americans," the economist said. "The background is H-1B was introduced in 1990 to bring top talent in engineering technology and medicine. The original salary cut-off was $60,000 which in 1990 was about twice the salary of an entry-level programmer. In other words, top talent.""The problem is it was never adjusted for inflation and $60K is now below an entry-level programmer. If it were adjusted for inflation, the minimum H-1B today would be $139,000. So what was originally supposed to be the best and brightest in the world is now a giant sweatshop. And giant it is. The initial H-1B cap was just 65,000 workers a year that grew to 85, then they added an unlimited exemption for universities, non-profits and government. Given each H-1B is a six-year visa and extendable, not 65,000, it's not 85,000, it's 730,000 H-1Bs, which is about one in 8 tech jobs," Onge broke it down. "It gets worse because after a few years as H-1Bs can be converted into green cards, who get to stay permanently. By one estimate, that's another 1.5 to 2 million H-1Bs, plus in dependents educated with your tax dollars, and we are talking roughly 3 million people on the H-1b gravy train, including roughly a million and a half tech workers, which is about one quarter of all tech jobs.""Now it's one thing if the workers were making $139 or $190, that's top talent who build companies and create jobs but at 60,000 is a different story. At that level, they are replacing entry-level American tech workers who never got the chance to upskill, build companies and create jobs."Onge said the cleanest fix would be simply to adjust for inflation, so instead of 60 it's 139,000, as what Elon and Vivek were proposing earlier this year, along with an annual fee to ensure H-1Bs are only used for top talent. "Now Trump is planning something more aggressive, converting the program to a kind of reverse auction where the highest wages get the slots. So if you are hiring a rockstar German AI programmer for half a million, it's automatic as it should be. If you're trying to brain drain Bangalore, it is a no," the economist said.

The US embassy in India issued a fresh warning to Indians against overstaying in the US and explained the difference between the 'Admit until date' and the expiry of the visa date. "Your authorized period of stay is the 'Admit Until Date' on your I-94, not your U.S. visa expiration date. Staying in the United States beyond your authorized date is called an “overstay” and could result in a visa revocation, possible deportation, and ineligibility for future visas," the embassy said.What is 'admit until date'?It is the date mentioned on I-94 (arrival/departure record) which is issued by the US Customs and Border Protection. It is not written on the visa. If you entered the US on a visa with a fixed duration (like B-1/B-2 visitor visas, F-1 students, or H-1B workers), the admit until date will usually be a specific calendar date. You must either leave the US, extend your stay, or change status on or before that date to remain in lawful status.In some cases (like many F-1 student visas or J-1 exchange visitors), the I-94 may say “D/S” (Duration of Status) instead of a date. That means you are admitted for as long as you maintain your student or exchange status, not until a specific day.Visa expiry dateThe 'admit until date' is different from the visa expiry date, which is stamped in the passport. It is the last day one can use to visa to enter the United States. It does not control how long you can stay inside the US after you’ve already entered.If one overstays the date mentioned on the I-94 document as the 'admit until date', they are out of status even if their visa has not expired. While the visa expiry date denotes the deadline to enter the US, the 'admit until date' is the deadline to stay in the US.

USCIS will take a holistic view of your ‘good moral character’Lubna Kably / TNN / Updated: Aug 17, 2025, 22:47 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLarge  The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has announced a major policy shift that restores a rigorous and holistic approach to evaluating ‘good moral character’ (GMC) of foreign nationals applying for American citizenship.To illustrate: Driving under influence could impair your eligibility, but if you have skipped on taxes – but subsequently coughed up your dues this could be a redeeming factor. Or if you have good educational qualifications and job stability, this too could score you brownie points. The policy memorandum, issued on Aug 15, emphasizes that US citizenship is more than a legal benefit—it represents a profound transformation into active and responsible membership in American society.Trump Outrages World With Unprecedented Travel Ban | 'Racist, Downright Cruel'In fiscal 2024 (year ended Sept 30), 8.18 lakh foreign nationals acquired US citizenship. Mexicans led with as many as 1.07 lakh becoming American citizens (13% of the total), this was followed by Indians, with a little over 49,000 (or 6% of the total) acquiring US citizenship. The trend was similar to earlier years, Indians are the second largest contingent to acquire US citizenship.Going forward, those aspiring to become US citizens will be subjected to the new policy guidelines. Titled – ‘Restoring a rigorous, holistic and comprehensive good moral character evaluation standard for aliens applying for naturalization (citizenship)’, under it USCIS officials will no longer treat GMC as a simple checklist of disqualifying offenses. Instead, they are directed to consider the ‘totality of circumstances’, weighing both negative conduct and positive contributions.The policy highlights that while certain offenses—such as murder, aggravated felonies, torture, or genocide—remain permanent and unconditional bars to naturalization, officials must now also assess evidence of rehabilitation and reformation in other cases.“The regulations and policy affirm that GMC findings must go beyond the absence of disqualifying acts—it must reflect a genuine positive assessment of who the applicant is and how they have lived in their community,” the policy states.Positive attributes and contributions such as sustained community involvement and contributions in the US; family caregiving, responsibility, and ties in the US; educational attainments; stable and lawful employment history and achievements; length of lawful residence in the US, compliance with tax obligations and financial responsibility in the US will carry greater weight. .At the same time USCIS officials will scrutinize behaviours inconsistent with civic responsibility, including repeat driving under influence convictions, false claims to citizenship, unlawful voting, and even patterns of reckless or disruptive conduct.Immigration attorneys are largely of the view that a move away from a rule-based model to a more discretionary one may be a slippery slope. Eligibility results could vary based on the subjective discretion of the official vetting the application and could result in lack of uniformity across cases.In general individuals can apply for US citizenship, after they have been lawful permanent residents (green card holders) for at least five years. A Chicago based Indian family that was examining the possibility of applying for citizenship told TOI, “Years ago, when we initially moved to the US, both of us faced tax disputes owing to interpretation of the India-US tax treaty. This could be a blot on our record.”Loss of jobs during the pandemic and non repayment of interest or principal amount against loans could also be issues that come up for many aspirants during processing of citizenship applications, they point out.However, there appears to be a ray of hope. For applicants with past ‘wrongdoing’ , USCIS officials will look for concrete evidence of rehabilitation, including repayment of taxes, compliance with court-ordered conditions, or testimony from community members. According to the policy guidelines, such evidence may support a finding of good moral character even where negative history exists, provided no permanent bar applies.It may be recalled that Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed as director of USCIS in July, told NY Times in an interview that the current US citizenship test is “too easy”—noting that many applicants can simply memorize answers and pass without true understanding. This is another change that could be on the anvil.About the AuthorLubna KablyLubna Kably is a senior editor, who focuses on various policies and legislation.

A Canadian court has blocked the deportation of Jagjit Singh, an Indian-origin man, citing that his separation from his wife, who has ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder), will cause "irreparable harm" to the wife. According to the court filing, Singh came to Canada in 2021 on a temporary resident visa and made a refugee claim. Then he got married in Canada and his wife applied to sponsor his permanent resident application, and Jagjit Singh withdrew his refugee claim this year.But his removal process already began while his resident application was under review and the Canada Border Services Agency finally ordered him to be deported. Singh appealed to Canada's federal court against the deportation order and claimed that he would be in danger if he were sent back to India.Singh also claimed that his removal would cause "serious prejudices to his spouse due to her health conditions".Federal Judge Avvy Yao-Yao Go said she has evidence in front of her that Singh's wife, referred to as LB in court documents, suffers from ADHD which impairs her ability to manage time and everyday responsibilities. "In the case before me, there is evidence that L.B. suffers from ADHD which impairs her ability to manage time, stress focus and everyday responsibilities and that [Singh] provides her with support by, among other things, helping her maintain daily structure and reminders for medications and appointments, and providing her with emotional stability and mental health support," Go said.The ruling drew backlash on social media, with many users pointing out that ADHD is not that serious. "The judge who halted an Indian man's deportation order because his wife has ADHD was an activist before being appointed to the bench," one wrote. Many social media users said his wife should also go to India with him. "I wonder how his wife survived before she met him?" one person said. "This is beyond insulting. Not only to people with ADHD, but to our country. So pathetic," another wrote.The judge faced backlash for citing his wife’s ADHD as an excuse, with many saying it undermined those who actually suffer from the condition Avvy Yao-Yao Go immigrated to Canada from Hong Kong in the 1980s and worked as Clinic Director of the Chinese and Southeast Asian Legal Clinic before becoming a judge.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

One of the group took his metal water bottle and hit him above the eye, causing heavy bleeding. He was taken to hospital where he received eight stitches. Gardaí confirmed they are investigating the assault and his injuries are “non-life threatening”.An Indian-origin woman has put a post on Reddit saying her 60-year-old father was harassed by boys, aged around seven and eight, who tried to take his wallet at a bus stop in Dublin on Aug 9.These are just the latest in a string of racist attacks targeting Indians in Ireland which have left the Indian community terrified to step outside.India Day in Ireland, which celebrates the country’s cultural ties, has been postponed this Sunday owing to the wave of hate crimes. The event has been organised by the Ireland India Council since 2015. A Ficci India Day event is going ahead in Dublin on Aug 17.Indian community leaders met Ireland deputy PM Simon Harris on Monday after which he condemned the “despicable acts of violence and racism”.Chairman of the Ireland India Council Prashant Shukla told Ireland AM: “We weren’t worried about the event itself as the Gardaí assured us about safety, but we were worried about the perception it could lead to further attacks. Our message to the Irish community is that these attacks are attacks on your economy and industry. Policing needs to go to the next level. I feel there are not proper investigations and arrests. We are all working, paying taxes and contributing to the economy. No one is getting a free house. People are spreading misinformation that Indians buying houses is causing house prices to go up.”President of Ireland Michael D Higgins on Tuesday also condemned the attacks. “A lot of Indians are reconsidering their choices and may move back to India if the situation doesn’t improve. It is mostly being caused by far-right groups encouraging teenagers to attack immigrants. Indians are the most visible immigrants here,” said Indian national Some Aditya Mandal, who has worked in Dublin for eight years.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle10 baby names that mean creativity and visionLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?Maharashtra’s UNESCO World Heritage Sites and other iconic monuments for history loversRajinikanth completes 50 years in cinema: Lesser-known facts about the ‘Coolie’ star6 lizards that prove reptiles can be adorableHow to unrot your brain: 5 effective steps to sharpen focus and boost mental clarityFrom Mullum Malarum to Kabali: Rajinikanth’s most emotional movies that fans still cherish123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

Dr Ajay Aggarwal, an Indian-origin pain medicine doctor from Houston, has agreed to pay over $2 million to resolve allegations of medical fraud against him, the US Justice Department revealed. Between 2021 and 2023, the 63-year-old doctor billed federally funded health care programs like Medicare and the Department of Labor’s Workers’ Compensation Programs for surgical implants that he never performed. Dr Aggarwal received thousands of dollars per procedure, but patients received simple devices which required no surgery. And all device placements used to take place at Aggarwal's clinic, not a hospital or surgical center. “A doctor who uses simple medical devices on his patients, yet bills Medicare for a sophisticated spinal surgery, is billing the American taxpayer, plain and simple,” said US Attorney Nicholas J Ganjei.. “The Southern District of Texas will ensure that losses to federally funded healthcare programs from fraudulent billing, like what happened here, are recouped and that wrongdoers are held accountable.”PollDoes the healthcare billing system need stricter monitoring to prevent fraud?YesNoA 2023 document of the DOJ revealed that earlier he was accused of giving unnecessary treatment to federal employees with federal workers' compensation benefits and his pharmacy Medley, which was officially owned by his wife, filed the prescriptions. An employee of Medley acted as a whistleblower and said that during his term of employment, he saw patients being sent unnecessary with unnecessary medications being prescribed. In some cases, the patients did not even see or meet Dr Aggarwal. And Medley employees were allegedly instructed to auto-fill medications on a monthly basis and to use pre-printed prescription pads to submit the prescriptions to DOL-OWCP without consideration of medical need. The new fraud of Dr Aggarwal came to be reported at a time when foreign doctors are under fire, while several Republican leaders said US needs more doctors and foreign doctors can fill the gap.

Indian-origin foreign nationals holding an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card could now lose it if they face serious criminal charges or convictions, the government has announced.In a fresh gazette notification, the ministry of home affairs said that the OCI registration will be cancelled if the holder is sentenced to imprisonment for two years or more, or is named in a charge sheet for an offence carrying a jail term of seven years or more."In exercise of the powers conferred by the clause (da) of section 7D of the Citizenship Act, 1955 (57 of 1955), the central government hereby states that an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) registration shall be liable to get cancelled when a person has been sentenced to imprisonment for term of not less than two years or has been charge-sheeted for an offence entailing punishment of imprisonment for seven years or more," the notification said, as cited by PTI.PollShould stricter rules be applied to Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) cardholders?NoYesThe OCI card allows Indian-origin foreign nationals to visit India without a visa. The scheme, introduced in August 2005, enables registration as OCI for all persons of Indian origin who were citizens of India on January 26, 1950 or later, or were eligible to become citizens on that date, except for those who are, or have been, citizens of Pakistan, Bangladesh or any other country specified by the government in the official gazette.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Indian-origin Dr Vinay Prasad returns to FDA weeks after exit
Dr Vinay Prasad, previously ousted from his FDA vaccine chief position due to criticism from Laura Loomer over past anti-Trump comments and drug approval decisions, has been reinstated. This unusual move suggests the influence of RFK Jr within the Trump administration despite pressure from right-wing activists.

This unusual move suggests the influence of RFK Jr within the Trump administration despite pressure from right-wing activists. RFK Jr opposed anti-vaxxer Dr Prasad's exit and remained invested to bring him back.  Dr Vinay Prasad is back at his FDA job weeks after exit that was prompted by right-wing activist Laura Loomer's campaigning against Prasad. Dr Vinay Prasad, the Indian-origin vaccine chief of the FDA who was forced to resign in July after far-right activist Laura Loomer led a campaign against him, has been reinstated to his job in an unusual instance. Laura Loomer pointed out the critical comments that Dr Prasad made about President Donald Trump before joining the administration, while some of his decisions to deny drug approvals also came under fire. A Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson confirmed to the New York Times that Dr Prasad is returning to the agency. “At the F.D.A.’s request, Dr. Vinay Prasad is resuming leadership of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research,” Andrew Nixon, a health department spokesman, said in a statement.The NYT report observed that Dr Prasad's rehiring suggests that the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr., and the FDA commissioner, Dr Marty Makary, remain influential enough in the Trump administration to employ someone who had previously expressed disdain for Trump and his followers.Loomer reacted to the reinstatement and called in another "egregious personnel decision". "In another egregious personnel decision under the Trump administration, it is now being reported that longtime progressive Marxist Vinay Prasad who referred to President Trump’s supporters as criminals and compared them to drug addicts after saying he stabbed a Trump voodoo doll to “curse Trump” is apparently back at FDA," Loomer wrote.RFK Jr tapped Dr Prasad in May when the previous head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation left the role. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Dr Prasad gained prominence as an outspoken critic of vaccines and mask mandate. In his short stint at the FDA since May, Dr Prasad limited the use of Covid-19 vaccines and promoted warnings about a rare side effect of the vaccines. When he resigned from his role weeks ago, a department spokesperson told the NYT: "Dr. Prasad did not want to be a distraction to the great work of the FDA in the Trump administration and has decided to return to California and spend more time with his family."Kennedy, however, opposed Prasad's departure from the role and remained invested in bringing him back. Dr Prasad was born and brought up in Ohio and Chicago to Indian immigrant parents.

An Indian-origin techie, Manasi Mishra, who graduated with a computer science degree from Purdue University, revealed in a TikTok video as she was getting ready that the only company that called her for an interview was Chipotle. Titled 'Chipotle Interview GRWM', the TikTok video went viral as she appealed 'somebody pls hire me'. In an interview with New York Times, after the video went viral, Mishra revealed that growing up near Silicon Valley, she was used to the narrative that if she learned to code, worked hard and studied computer science, she could get a six-figure starting salary. But recent graduates are finding it hard because of the spread of AI programming tools and also the recent layoffs at companies like Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft.The NYT story confirmed that Mishra did not get the burrito-making gig at Chipotle, and she finally found a sales position job at a tech company.Mishra's story and the NYT article triggered a major debate on the present job situation, layoff and how much of it should be blamed on foreign workers, AI etc. "This is why I really do feel for Gen Z. This young woman was told her whole life by every authority figure that she should study hard, do well in school, and pursue a career in tech. She went to Purdue, one of the best engineering schools in the country. She studied computer science, not gender ideology or basket weaving," one viral comment read on X. "And still she could not even get a job at Chipotle let alone in her field. She did literally everything “right” but, to what end? This situation is not sustainable. H1B and other work visas, as well as offshoring, are getting out of control and abusive. Policymakers should care about the young generation," the person wrote. Many people commented that the jobs that the Indian-origin person missed must have gone to people from India who are on H-1B.

(Photo: DailyEcho/Padharo) Ankit Vaghela, an Indian-origin restaurant owner in Southampton, was told by the police that they could not come to his 'Padharo' when he called 999 to report a break-in. The vandals broke in and fled with several bottles of expensive alcohol and cash but the police helpline asked them to email the CCTV footage of the three burglars who broke in last week.Vaghela decided to get proactive and review the footage first. He discovered his cash register without the cash, abandoned along with some smashed liquor bottles strewn on a nearby road. “It was very heartbreaking to be told that officers will be able to review the damage in three to five working days and that no forensics was available at the time,” said Vaghela.“There was glass everywhere. As a business, we can’t afford to remain closed and had to get things cleaned up and the glass fixed. We are still struggling to operate smoothly without a proper cash register, which will take time, but are determined to welcome our guests with the same level of service we are known for in the city,” he said.The Hampshire Police said they did not underestimate the July 31 case but they understood that their investigation could start without their immediate attendance at the site, as the offenders were not there. “Every deployment decision is based on informed risk assessments to make sure the most serious cases are prioritised, and officers are on scene where there is an immediate threat to life or a crime in action,” the police force said in a statement.“On this occasion, based on the initial information we were given regarding the offenders no longer being at the scene, our investigation could get underway without any immediate attendance.

In a separate incident, Laxman Das, an Indian sous chef in Dublin, was attacked and robbed while going to work. These incidents follow a series of recent assaults targeting Indians in Ireland, raising concerns about racism.  TOI correspondent from London: A six-year-old Indian-origin girl and an Indian sous chef are the latest victims in the ongoing spate of racist attacks targeting Indian nationals and Indian-origin Irish people in Ireland.The girl, whose family hail from Kottayam, Kerala, was playing outside her house in Waterford City, southeast Ireland, with friends at 7.30pm on Monday evening when a gang of boys and one girl called her a “dirty Indian” and told her to “go back to India”. She was born in Ireland. Five of the gang also punched her in the face, hit her private parts with a bicycle, punched her neck and twisted her hair.Her mother moved to Ireland eight years ago from Kottayam to work as a nurse with her husband and recently became an Irish citizen.The mother said the gang was made up of boys aged 12 to 14 and a girl aged eight. She said her daughter came home in floods of tears and is now too scared to play outside. She told the Irish Mirror: “I never expected that such an incident would happen. I thought she would be safe here. Even in front of our own house she can’t play safely. I am a nurse, I am doing my best to take care of people. I do my work and I am 100% professional. I changed my citizenship, but still we are called dirty people and even my kids are not safe. We came here to fill a labour gap. We are professionals — we have all the certificates…”The mother studied BSc Nursing at University of Calicut and went to Mount Carmel Higher Secondary School in Kottayam.“Gardaí (Irish national police) responded to a report of an alleged assault in the Kilbarry area of Waterford city on the evening of Monday 4 August. Investigations are ongoing,” a Garda spokesperson told TOI.On Wednesday morning Laxman Das from Kolkata, who works as a sous chef at the Anantara The Marker Dublin hotel, was assaulted near the Hilton Hotel by three people while on his way to work. He was taken to St Vincent's University Hospital. His phone, cash and electric bike were stolen.These come following a spate of attacks against Indians in Ireland in recent weeks — on July 19, July 24, July 27, and on Aug 1 when a cab driver was assaulted.The Gardaí said they are still investigating these attacks and no one has been arrested.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning looks of Binny Sebastiantv10 baby names that mean ‘divine light’ or ‘sacred glow’Lifestyle10 Birds with the "wildest dating rituals"LifestyleRaksha Bandhan: 10 iconic lines of famous Hindi poets that capture essence of the festivalLifestyleKarishma Tanna Stuns with Style and SpiritEntertainmentFrom Moong to Chia Sprouts: How to grow your breakfast in balconyLifestyleBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Here’s how much each contestant earns dailytv10 creatures that survive in the deepest parts of the oceanLifestyleRaksha Bandhan: 10 quotes that describe the beautiful bond between brothers and sistersLifestyleHow to do step-by-step Ayurveda hair therapy at homeLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Threads of Love, Threads of Tradition: How different Indian states celebrate Raksha BandhanFrom chapatis to cake: 7 delicious ways to use overripe bananasInternational Cat Day 2025: From Persian to Bengal Cat-- 5 most beautiful and popular pet cat breeds in the world5 diseases moles on your body might indicate and should not be ignoredNot-so popular drinks that help in weightloss10 places in South Africa that aren’t to be missed in a lifetimeMemorable style outings of Princess CharlotteHow Kangana Ranaut turned fame into fearless politicsFrom ₹6 Lakh to ₹40 Lakh: A peek into Kamal Haasan’s ultra-luxe watch closetFrom Archana reacting to a hate comment to son Aaryamann revealing how he impressed girlfriend Yogita Bihani: Archana Puran Singh shares candid moments123Hot PicksGlobal Standard indexUS stocks todayIndia-US tariffIntel CEOMukesh AmbaniUS jobless dataRussia crude oilTop TrendingTom BradyDonald TrumpSouth Park EpisodeCall of DutyMalik BeasleyBattlefield 6 Beta OpensPrivate School in IndianaLuka Doncic Weight LossLinda McMahonLakers RumorsTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteUAE launches national programme to train Emiratis in space mission design and satellite engineering'PM Modi can't, shouldn't bend knee to Donald Trump': US tariffs on India draws rare bipartisan concern in US - watch'Enormous mistake': What Trump's former NSA John Bolton said on India tariffChild assault under false identity: Indian man commits suicide in US jail months after 35-year prison sentence, claim reportsLove gone wild: Indian man faces deportation for harassing UK zoo colleague for 6 months; didn’t stop even after restraining order'Before judging...': Wife of Pakistani man Salman Iftikhar who threatened Virgin Atlantic air hostess with gangrape defends outburstFriedrich Merz halts German military exports to Israel over Gaza issue; urges aid accessGround invasion in Gaza?

The arrest occurred due to possession of a fake resident card. Authorities took him into custody in Niagara Falls, New York. He faces a potential 10-year prison sentence. The arrest is part of 'Operation Take Back America'. This initiative targets illegal immigration.  An Indian national has been arrested in the United States for allegedly possessing a forged alien resident card, according to the Justice Department. Swapnil Ramesh Tejale, 34, was taken into custody following a traffic stop in Niagara Falls, New York, and now faces a federal charge that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.“On July 10, 2025, the Niagara Falls Border Patrol Station received a request from the Niagara Falls Police Department to help identify three individuals that they had encountered during a traffic stop,” said Assistant US Attorney Michael J. Smith, who is prosecuting the case. “Agents arrived at the scene and questioned the three individuals as to their citizenship. Tejale presented a Lawful Permanent Resident Card but voluntarily admitted that the card was fictitious.”Authorities later confirmed that Tejale was in the country unlawfully and did not possess any valid immigration documents. Following his arrest, agents discovered a Social Security card in his name, which was also found to be counterfeit.The case falls under “Operation Take Back America”, a Justice Department initiative aimed at tackling illegal immigration and dismantling transnational criminal organisations. The operation seeks to “repel the invasion of illegal immigration” and “protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime”, the department said.The investigation was led by the US Border Patrol Niagara Falls Station, under the direction of Patrol Agent in Charge Brady Waikal.Tejale’s arrest is part of a series of immigration enforcement actions involving Indian nationals this year. In a related incident, an Indian man from Santa Rosa, California, was sentenced in March to six months in prison for conspiracy to transport aliens for profit. Meanwhile, Manjot Singh, a 25-year-old Indian national, was recently arrested in the Seattle area for repeat offences including robbery, assault, and criminal impersonation. Singh, who entered the U.S. illegally, is currently in ICE custody pending deportation.ICE officials have said that Singh’s arrest is a warning to repeat offenders: “Those who violate US laws while in the country illegally face arrest and deportation.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Viral footage shows firefighters inspecting the scene as the family performed the ritual. (Photo: X) A housewarming ceremony involving a Hindu havan at a Texas home took an unexpected turn when local firefighters arrived at the scene, mistaking the ritual for a fire emergency.The incident was captured on video. The footage has gone viral and has fuelled an online debate over cultural awareness and fire safety. The clip was originally shared on Instagram. It shows a fire truck from the Bedford fire department pulling up outside the house as smoke from the ceremony fills the garage. Inside, an Indian family can be seen performing a traditional havan, a religious ritual involving fire, as part of their housewarming puja.The video includes on-screen text stating, "Cultural misunderstanding 101: A Hindu puja is not a fire emergency. When you're having a housewarming havan and the fire department pulls up."Shortly after the fire crew arrives, they are seen speaking with members of the family and inspecting the area. However, it remains unclear whether any formal action was taken or if any fire codes were violated during the ritual.The footage has since been widely circulated across social media platforms, with users offering differing views on the incident. Some social media users criticised the family for conducting a ritual involving fire in a residential setting, arguing it could pose safety risks.

Indian-origin Mathura Sridharan was appointed as Ohio's 12th solicitor general, inviting the wrath of online trolls who questioned why a 'non-US-origin' person was not picked for the post. Sridharan's LinkedIn went viral as critics questioned her credibility -- forcing Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost to issue a clarification, or a clapback at the trolls. Dave Yost, who announced Mathura's promotion, said Mathura is wrongly being portrayed as a non-American. "A few commenters have asserted incorrectly that Mathura is not American. She is a United States citizen, married to a US citizen, and the child of naturalized US citizens," he said. "If her name or her complexion bother you, the problem is not with her or her appointment," he added."Mathura is brilliant… she won her argument at SCOTUS last year. Both the SGs she worked under (Flowers & Gaiser) recommended her. I told her when I originally hired her I needed her to argue with me. She does… All the time! Excited to promote her. She will serve Ohio well," Yost wrote.Yost's clapback also met trolling as people commented that she is not "American-American". "Is she a Christian? That’s the biggest factor that concerns me. Based on the bindi on her forehead, I worry she is not," one wrote. "Another American job… given away to foreigners," another wrote. "She's Indian. They all have a loyalty first to other Indians. horrible pick. Totally un-American. the GOP is pathetic," a third user wrote."No one with the last name 'Sridharan' fought in the US Civil War. She's not an American," another wrote.Before joining the Ohio Solicitor’s Office, Mathura clerked for Judge Steven J. Menashi of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and Judge Deborah A. Batts of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. She holds a Juris Doctor from New York University School of Law, a Master’s Degree in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as a Bachelor’s Degree in Economics and in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Following Nikhil Ravishankar's appointment as Air New Zealand's CEO, media outlets in New Zealand disabled social media comments due to a surge of racist remarks targeting his Indian ethnicity.

News organizations like New Zealand Herald, Radio New Zealand, and 1News cited their inability to moderate the hateful content as the reason for shutting down comments.   After Indian-origin Nikhil Ravishankar was appointed as the new chief executive of Air New Zealand, the country's media said they had to disable comments on social media as there was a barrage of racist remarks targeting Ravishankar's ethnicity. Ravishankar was the chief digital officer of Air New Zealand before getting the major promotion which is the first for an Indian-origin person in the country.New Zealand Herald, Radio New Zealand, 1News said they had to disable comments as they can't allow hatred. The New Zealand Herald issued a statement in which it clarified that there were several racist comments owing to which they had to take the extreme step. "We appreciate the high level of interest in this story but cannot safely moderate it at this time," the news outlet said in a post in the comment thread."We want to foster a safe online community by reducing instances of hate, racism, abuse and misinformation. We welcome your feedback on articles but there has to be some parameters, and these are explained in our community house rules...We cannot tolerate hate. We cannot tolerate abuse towards individuals in our stories or other commenters," the company's social media policy says. Radio New Zealand had to do the same on the social media post on Ravishankar's appointment. "Under RNZ's comments policy, we will proactively disable comments on posts which may attract abusive or harmful comments or when resources are required elsewhere," a spokesperson for RNZ said. "In this instance, the comments were disabled after our monitoring found racist comments," the spokesperson said. "We want people to feel safe and respected on our community forums and will continue to proactively disable comments where necessary. We will not tolerate harmful communications."1News said it received a large number of comments on the post that announced Ravishankar's appointment and a vast majority were inappropriate. Who is Nikhil Ravishankar?Nikhil Ravishankar was born in India but brought up in New Zealand. He studied in New Zealand -- holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) from the University of Auckland. Before joining Air New Zealand, Ravishankar was Chief Digital Officer at Vector New Zealand (from 2017), and also worked as a Managing Director at Accenture across Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand, and in senior technology roles at Spark (formerly Telecom NZ).About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Who's Trisha Chatterjee? Indian-origin lawyer who said ICE gave her Taco Bell number
Trisha Chatterjee, an Ohio immigration lawyer, claims an ICE officer gave her a Taco Bell number instead of assistance with urgent client cases, sparking controversy. After her TikTok video went viral, another ICE official offered help. Chatterjee highlights the broader issue of poor ICE communication, impacting immigrants facing detention and difficult bond policies, leading some to abandon their asylum claims.

After her TikTok video went viral, another ICE official offered help. Chatterjee highlights the broader issue of poor ICE communication, impacting immigrants facing detention and difficult bond policies, leading some to abandon their asylum claims. Trisha Chatterjee (Picture source: LinkedIn) Trisha Chatterjee, an Indian-origin immigration lawyer in Ohio, has alleged she was given the number of a Taco Bell outlet when she called ICE for urgent client support. Chatterjee posted about the incident on TikTok, where it went viral and ultimately led to help from another ICE official. But she says the larger issue lack of clear access to immigration authorities continues to cause serious harm to her clients."I called and they answered and they said, 'Hello, Taco Bell?' And I said, 'Taco Bell?' And the guy who was working said, 'Yeah, Taco Bell. Ma'am, you called me," Chatterjee recalled."I was in such disbelief," she said. "So, I called the ICE officer back, just really frustrated with what had just happened. He says, 'Oh, I'm sorry. I was trying to lighten the mood and make you laugh.'"ICE has denied the accusation. Homeland security called it a “lie and a smear.” Chatterjee stood by her version of events.Who is Trisha Chatterjee? Trisha Chatterjee is an Indian-origin immigration lawyer based in Greater Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio. She graduated from Miami University in 2020 and the University of Dayton School of Law in 2023.She works with the law office of Emily Feliz Garcia, a small immigration firm in Springdale. Before this, she worked at Abdallah law offices.For the last two years, she has handled immigration cases, especially those involving clients detained at the Butler County Jail in Ohio, which has a contract with ICE.Chatterjee was trying to submit "stay of removal" applications—urgent paperwork that can pause deportation for clients with pending immigration cases. ICE requires these to be submitted in person at the Detroit field office, but she hoped to file them locally in Blue Ash.After being unable to reach anyone by phone or email, she finally spoke to an ICE officer who gave her a phone number that turned out to be for Taco Bell. When she called back, the officer reportedly said he was trying to make her laugh.She posted a video about the incident on TikTok, which gained over 38,000 views. Many users sympathised, and one even helped her connect with a helpful ICE official in Blue Ash, who is now assisting her.Chatterjee said the larger problem is the lack of access and communication with ICE. She also highlighted how a stricter bond policy is making it harder for immigrants to stay out of detention during legal proceedings. Bonds can cost up to $50,000 and must be paid upfront.According to Chatterjee, some clients are abandoning their asylum cases or choosing to self-deport out of fear. She mentioned recent local arrests of people attending ICE check-ins, which has only deepened anxiety in immigrant communities.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The alleged abuse occurred in Contra Costa County, according to the district attorney’s office.Jennifer Powell, 45, has also been charged with 24 counts in a related felony complaint. Both Bhagwagar and Powell are being held at the Martinez detention facility. Bhagwagar’s bail has been set at $15 million.The charges in both cases carry possible prison terms of 15 years to life. Bhagwagar is expected to be arraigned Wednesday in Martinez, California.“Our office stands firmly committed to protecting children and holding those who cause harm accountable,” said Contra Costa county district attorney Diana Becton in a statement. “Every child deserves to feel safe, protected and heard when an injustice like this occurs.”According to the Contra Costa county sheriff’s office, detectives had been investigating Bhagwagar since April. His arrest was made with the assistance of Homeland Security Investigations after a warrant was issued.A short video published by aviation blog View From the Wing shows officers with badges exiting the plane’s cockpit.Delta Air Lines released a statement saying it was “appalled by reports of the charges related to the arrest” and confirmed that Bhagwagar had been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation. “Delta has zero tolerance for unlawful conduct,” the airline said.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani faces criticism for visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam due to his past support for defunding the police. Critics accuse Mamdani of shifting his stance for political gain, especially after his 2020 tweets resurfaced. Mamdani defends his actions, clarifying his current position on public safety and police funding. Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is facing backlash after visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam, as critics pointed to his past 2020 tweet supporting "defund the police" stance.The controversy erupted after Mamdani, who recently returned from a trip to Uganda, visited the grieving family of officer Islam, one of four victims killed in a mass shooting in Midtown Manhattan. Zohran Mamdani’s SECRET Wedding Triggers Fury Amid Local Tragedy | WATCHThe shooter, Shane Tamura, opened fire on Monday, killing Islam and three others before shooting himself.Sharing a post on X, Mamdani wrote: “Two days ago, an act of senseless violence took the lives of Officer Didarul Islam, Wesley LePatner, Aland Etienne, and Julia Hyman. Today, I visited Officer Islam's family and learned of his legacy. I ask you to join me in honoring the memory of these four New Yorkers.”However, the post quickly drew criticism, with users referencing Mamdani’s previous tweets during the height of the “Defund the Police” movement in 2020.Many accused him of changing his stance for political gain. One user wrote, “You can't go from defund the police to never mind I love the police. You're asking New Yorkers to forgo their guns meanwhile you just had a wedding in Uganda with armed guards.”While another posted, “Zohran Mamdani exposed as a total fraud. Mocking cops, calling them racist, then acting like he cares? No loyalty to America. He belongs in Uganda, not leading NYC. Deport him and protect our city!”Earlier at a press conference following his visit to the officer’s home in The Bronx, Mamdani addressed the criticism and attempted to clarify his position saying: “I am not defunding the police; I am not running to defund the police.”“Over the course of this race, I’ve been very clear about my view of public safety and the critical role that the police have in creating that public safety,” he added.Standing alongside members of the Bangladeshi American Police Association—of which Officer Islam was a member—and labor union 32BJ, which represented another victim, Aland Etienne, Mamdani tried to strike a unifying tone.During the peak of the "Defund the Police" movement in 2020, Zohran Mamdani repeatedly called for major cuts to the NYPD budget. In one post, he wrote, “We don’t need an investigation to know that the NYPD is racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety. What we need is to #DefundTheNYPD.”In another, he said, “There is no negotiating with an institution this wicked & corrupt. Defund it. Dismantle it. End the cycle of violence,” referencing budget talks around proposed NYPD cuts.Now, Mamdani has distanced himself from those remarks. When asked about them, he responded, “My statements in 2020 were made amidst a frustration that many New Yorkers held at the murder of George Floyd.”Mamdani claimed that his current stance is more nuanced, stating that his previous posts were “clearly out of step” with his recent campaign platform. He now supports maintaining the NYPD headcount while reducing its overtime budget.Despite this clarification, skepticism remains. Many police officers and political observers have accused Mamdani of shifting positions purely for political gain in a city where public safety remains a top concern for voters, New York Post reported.Adding to the political firestorm, former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams, who are both trailing Mamdani in early polling for the 2025 mayoral race, weighed in shortly after the shooting. Mamdani fired back, accusing Cuomo of politicising the tragedy saying, “It is beyond me that politicians are looking to use these days to score such cynical political points, on the very day that I held the father of Officer Islam in my arms and he could not utter a single word.”“For the former governor to spend an entire day speaking almost exclusively about me and barely about the New Yorkers who have been killed is indicative of the very politics New Yorkers want to leave in the past,” he added.All three, Mamdani, Cuomo, and Adams are expected to attend officer Islam’s funeral on Thursday.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The high court found him guilty of rape and outrage of modesty, following incidents at his Jurong West shop in 2021. Despite his denials and claims of erectile dysfunction, the judge deemed the victim's testimony credible.  An Indian national was sentenced to more than 14 years in jail on Thursday by the Singapore high court for sexually assaulting a minor, reports the Straits Times.Ramalingam Selvasekaran was handed a sentence of 14 years, three months and two weeks after being found guilty of rape and two counts of outrage of modesty after assaulting an 11-year-old at his provision shop in Jurong West.According to the court, the assaults occurred between 4.50 pm and 5.05 pm on October 28, 2021. The girl had visited Ramalingam’s store and returned later to buy ice cream. Prosecutors said he led her into a back area and forced her to perform oral sex. After the incident, the girl sought help from a passerby, who called the police.Ramalingam represented himself during the trial, which began on January 16. He was convicted on all charges on 7 July.“The fact that she had not run off after the first act of molest, or that she did not resist the assaults, or inform her grandfather, were all to my mind sufficiently explained, particularly given that she was still young and immature,” said Justice Aidan Xu, who found the girl’s account credible and consistent.Ramalingam’s earlier statements to police reportedly included admissions of hugging, kissing, and oral sex. However, he later denied any wrongdoing, claiming he was suffering from erectile dysfunction and that no DNA evidence was found on the victim.The judge ruled that these claims did not undermine the girl’s testimony. “While there was no dispute that Ramalingam suffered from erectile dysfunction, the prosecution’s expert witness gave a cogent explanation that oral rape remained possible,” Justice Xu was quoted as saying to Straits Times.Following sentencing on July 30, Ramalingam said he would appeal and was granted bail of S$80,000. He attempted to negotiate with the judge over the conditions, asking for the removal of his electronic tag and exemption from reporting to the Police Cantonment Complex. Both requests were denied.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Gill, who has enjoyed a stellar run as Test captain in England, has struggled to slot seamlessly into the current T20 combination. For chief selector Ajit Agarkar and his panel, the question is whether it makes sense to disturb a side that has been functioning smoothly.   The talent pool available only complicates matters. Indian cricket currently has an abundance of options, with multiple players ready to step in for every position. At the top of the batting order alone, six names are in contention.   While Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson, and Tilak Varma impressed last season, Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and IPL’s Orange Cap winner Sai Sudharsan are equally compelling picks.   In spin, the competition is just as tight. Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, and Ravi Bishnoi are all pressing for selection, while veteran Yuzvendra Chahal remains on the fringes.   Inside the team management, there are two schools of thought. Some feel it would be unjust to drop consistent performers in order to bring back a bigger star. Others argue that Gill represents the future of Indian cricket—an all-format captain in the making and a strong commercial face for the game.   But his return won’t be straightforward. Under Suryakumar Yadav’s captaincy, India has won 17 of its last 20 T20Is, a remarkable record achieved without Gill or Jaiswal. Yet, before focusing on Tests, both had been doing well in T20Is and the IPL.   Gill also briefly served as Surya’s deputy before his Test duties took over, with Axar Patel stepping in as vice-captain. Reinstating Gill could leave Axar feeling sidelined, despite his reliable performances.   If Gill is named in the 15, selectors may need to reshuffle the playing XI, forcing one of Abhishek, Sanju, or Tilak out. Rinku Singh could also miss out, particularly since head coach Gautam Gambhir doesn’t believe in a fixed “finisher’s” role, reducing the left-hander’s importance.   Fast Bowling Choices  Hardik Pandya, Jasprit Bumrah, and Arshdeep Singh are certainties, leaving one reserve seamer’s slot up for grabs. Harshit Rana appears to be the front-runner, with Prasidh Krishna and Mohammed Siraj largely seen as red-ball bowlers. With a home series against the West Indies in October, Bumrah may even be rested, giving others a chance.   Spin Department  Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, and Varun Chakravarthy are the leading names, with Washington Sundar likely to make the cut as well, thanks to his all-round abilities. Although conditions in Dubai and Abu Dhabi may not be overly slow, spinners are still expected to have a say.   All-rounders and Keepers  With Nitish Kumar Reddy and Rishabh Pant unavailable due to injuries, Shivam Dube is set to back up Hardik as a seam-bowling all-rounder. For the second wicketkeeper’s role, the contest is between Dhruv Jurel and Jitesh Sharma. Jitesh, who played a key role as a lower-order hitter in Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s IPL triumph, has the edge for the finisher’s slot. 12:54 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: ScheduleIndia will kick off their campaign against the UAE on September 10, while the high-voltage game against Pakistan is scheduled for the 14th, with both fixtures set to be played in Dubai. India will play their final group stage fixture against Oman on September 19 in Abu Dhabi.After the group stage, the tournament will proceed to the Super 4, where the top two teams from each group will qualify. If India finishes at the top of Group A, then all of their Super 4 matches will be held in Dubai. If India finishes second, then one of their Super 4 clashes will be held in Abu Dhabi and the remaining two in Dubai. The Super 4 stage will run from September 20 to 26. Dubai will host the final, which is scheduled for September 28.12:50 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Key talking pointsWith Suryakumar, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel being batting order certainties, it would be interesting to see if Shreyas gets a look in. What really strengthens Shreyas’ case is his spin-hitting prowess, much-improved skills to handle short balls and showing assurance as a reliable middle-order batter for Punjab Kings in IPL 2025.On the other hand, Jitesh’s name is a hot favourite for the reserve keeper-batter slot, who can also play finisher’s role when needed with his power-hitting skills and repertoire of ramps and scoops. Jitesh had a stellar IPL 2025 season with the bat and gloves to help Royal Challengers Bengaluru win its maiden IPL title.Amidst all this, Rinku, who was a part of India’s last T20I assignment against England in January, may just miss out. Rinku has been a designated finisher for both India and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). But a patchy IPL season and what if India seeks an all-rounder to excel in slow conditions in Dubai and Abu Dhabi may conjure up to weaken Rinku’s case.With Nitish Kumar Reddy still undergoing rehab for knee ligament injury, Riyan, Sundar and Shivam Dube shape up as contenders for an all-rounders’ slot. Sundar’s off-spin along with his batting makes him a tempting prospect while Dube is a like-to-like replacement for Nitish in terms of skillsets.Riyan, whose batting and handy spin bowling got him on T20I tours of Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka in 2024, provides the balance, but has not done anything worthwhile yet. With Axar, Kuldeep Yadav, and Varun Chakaravarthy set to helm spin department, it would be interesting to see who between Sundar and Riyan gets selectors’ backing.In fast bowling department, with Hardik, Jasprit Bumrah (provided he’s picked) and Arshdeep Singh around, decision needs to be made on including either of Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna and Harshit Rana. In the end, the Asia Cup squad will be the first glimpse of India’s plans for the World Cup, and debate over inclusions and omissions is certain to continue until the main tournament gets underway.12:38 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Pakistan squadSalman Ali Agha (c), Abrar Ahmed, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Hasan Nawaz, Hussain Talat, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Haris (wk), Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Waseem Jnr, Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, Salman Mirza, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Sufyan Moqim.12:24 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Captain checked inTeam India captain Suryakumar Yadav has arrived at the BCCI HQ ahead of the team selection.11:58 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Gill & JaiswalWhile Abhishek’s spot looks untouchable, the debate intensifies over the third opener. Both Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal last played a T20I in July 2024 and haven’t featured in the format since. Their Test form is strong, but in T20Is, they trail far behind Abhishek’s dominance.11:41 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Update&mdash; AraniBasuTOI (@AraniBasuTOI) 11:39 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: The Samson connectionSince October 2024, Abhishek and Sanju Samson have opened together in 12 consecutive matches, consistently giving India fiery starts. Their chemistry at the top has become one of India’s biggest assets heading into the Asia Cup.11:31 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Numbers don’t lieIn 16 T20I innings, Abhishek has blasted 535 runs at a staggering strike rate of 193.85 — the highest by any Indian with over 500 runs in the format. His record includes two centuries and two fifties, cementing his reputation as a powerplay destroyer.11:20 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Abhishek Sharma – Case Closed?Among the many selection debates, one name stands above the rest — Abhishek Sharma. With back-to-back explosive IPL seasons and a No.1 ICC T20I batting ranking, the 24-year-old opener has transformed from an IPL sensation into India’s most indispensable T20 batter.11:04 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Massive updateKindly note that the first press conference is expected to be delayed owing to weather disruptions.10:55 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Coach Predicts Dangerous DuoKuldeep’s coach Kapil Pandey believes the Kuldeep–Varun spin combo could be India’s trump card. “If they bowl together, opposition will have no time to think. Kuldeep is very hungry right now, and Varun complements him well. Against Pakistan, it could be a night to remember,” Pandey told TOI.10:44 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Selection Meeting TodayThe Ajit Agarkar-led panel meets at the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai today to pick India’s squad for the Asia Cup 2025.

Armed with nine variations, the 33-year-old mystery spinner already has two five-wicket hauls in T20Is and one in ODIs during India’s Champions Trophy run. With 33 wickets in 18 T20Is, Varun is seen as a key X-factor ahead of the Asia Cup.Don't missanything!Subscribe to our newsletter and get all the stories that matter delivered to your inboxInvalid id.

The left-arm wrist-spinner last played at the 2024 T20 World Cup, taking 10 wickets in five games. With 69 scalps in 40 T20Is, Kuldeep remains a lethal option in UAE’s spin-friendly conditions.09:46 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Spin & finisher debateThe spin attack looks strong with Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, and Varun Chakravarthy in pole position, while Washington Sundar could be backed by Gambhir for his all-round skills. In the lower order, Jitesh Sharma’s IPL-winning cameo-filled season gives him an edge over Dhruv Jurel for the second wicketkeeper slot.09:19 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Bowling department clearerUnlike batting, the bowling choices seem straightforward. Hardik Pandya, Jasprit Bumrah, and Arshdeep Singh are automatic picks, while Harshit Rana is the frontrunner for the reserve seamer slot. With Bumrah likely to be rested for the West Indies series in October, Siraj and Prasidh Krishna stand ready as backups.09:10 (IST) Aug 19Women's World Cup India Team Squad Live: Kranti Goud in the SpotlightAmong established names like Harmanpreet, Smriti, Jemimah, and Deepti, Mithali singled out 22-year-old pacer Kranti Goud as a potential X-factor. With only four ODIs under her belt, Goud impressed with a six-wicket haul in England, and Raj believes her raw pace and grit could be pivotal in India’s World Cup campaign.09:07 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Vice-captaincy conundrumIf Gill is recalled, what happens to leadership hierarchy? Gill earlier served as Suryakumar’s deputy before Test duties. Axar Patel, now vice-captain, has been steady in the role. A reshuffle could create dressing-room unease, adding another layer to the Gill inclusion debate.08:59 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Top-Order congestionIndia’s biggest puzzle lies in the top three. Six names are in contention: Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson, Tilak Varma, Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and Sai Sudharsan. With all in good form, selectors must decide whether to reward consistency or make room for Gill’s star power. One change could unsettle the settled XI.08:52 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Selection Day DilemmaThe Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee meets today with one burning question: how to fit Shubman Gill into India’s in-form T20I setup. Under Suryakumar Yadav’s captaincy, India boast an 85% win record (17 wins in 20 matches), making the task of tweaking the batting order both risky and controversial.08:47 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Women's World Cup squad to be announced todayIndia’s recent run of victories has bolstered confidence but the women’s selection panel, headed by Neetu David, will face some tricky questions on the inclusion of Shafali Verma and pacer Renuka Thakur when it meets here on Tuesday to pick the squad for the ODI World Cup.Apart from Pakistan playing all their matches in Colombo, India will host the 50-over World Cup comprising eight teams from September 30 with their eyes firmly set on an elusive global trophy.

The tournament will follow the T20I format and feature eight teams competing across both venues, with Dubai hosting 11 matches and Abu Dhabi hosting eight fixtures."The players who will be selected will be the best for the country, and I am very proud of the way we are playing cricket, the way we played against England. We will win the Asia Cup," Sharma told reporters.The Asian Cricket Council has confirmed the participation of five full member nations - Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka - along with the UAE, Oman, and Hong Kong. The teams have been divided into two groups, with India, Pakistan, UAE, and Oman in Group A, while Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Hong Kong form Group B.08:06 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Top 2 T20I run-scorers for both India and Pakistan won't be part of Asia Cup 2025 - here is whyThe 2025 T20 Asia Cup is set to have a very different look, with the leading run-getters of both India and Pakistan missing from the tournament.For India, stalwarts Rohit Sharma (4,231 runs) and Virat Kohli (4,188 runs) have already bid farewell to T20 internationals. On the other hand, Pakistan’s selectors have taken a bold step by leaving out Babar Azam (4,223 runs) and Mohammad Rizwan (3,414 runs) from the 17-member squad announced on Sunday.Pakistan, under new captain Salman Ali Agha, will warm up for the Asia Cup with a tri-series against Afghanistan and the UAE in Sharjah from August 29 to September 7. The continental showpiece kicks off in the Emirates on September 9.The exclusion of Babar and Rizwan has triggered intense debate across cricketing circles, especially considering the pair played pivotal roles in Pakistan’s iconic 10-wicket victory over India at the 2021 T20 World Cup.READ FULL STORY07:36 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: 'Don’t make Vaibhav Suryavanshi wait'Former India skipper Kris Srikkanth has backed 14-year-old sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi for a place in India’s 15-member squad for the Asia Cup T20, which begins on September 9. His endorsement comes just days before the selectors meet on August 19 to finalise the squad, with stiff competition for spots—particularly at the top of the order.Vaibhav has rapidly risen as a serious contender after a breakout season in IPL 2025, where he amassed 252 runs in just seven matches for the Rajasthan Royals at a strike rate of over 200. His whirlwind 35-ball century against Gujarat Titans was the second-fastest ton in IPL history, further cementing his reputation as one of the brightest young batting talents.The teenager carried that momentum into the U19 tour of England, where he struck a century and impressed across both one-day and four-day formats, showcasing his adaptability and temperament at the highest junior level."You have to play bold. Don't make him wait. Don't say things like 'let him mature'. He is already playing with remarkable maturity. His shot-making has been on another level. If I were chairman, I would definitely have him in the squad," Srikkanth stated on his YouTube show.READ FULL STORY07:06 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: All you need to know!When and where will 15-member side be announced? DateTimingVenue confirmedThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will unveil its 15-member squad for the ACC Men’s Asia Cup 2025 on Tuesday, following a high-profile selection meeting in Mumbai. The Senior Men’s Selection Committee will gather at the BCCI headquarters, with the squad announcement scheduled for 1:30 PM (IST) on the 4th floor of the BCCI HQ.The press conference will be attended by India’s T20 captain and the chairman of selectors.The Asia Cup, to be played in the T20 format in the UAE from September 9 to 28, comes just a year after India lifted the 2024 T20 World Cup.Naturally, the spotlight is on continuity and trust in the young T20 specialists who powered India’s success.Suryakumar Yadav is expected to continue as captain, having cleared his fitness test at the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence.According to a report from TOI, star opener Shubman Gill, despite stellar Test and IPL performances, may find it difficult to break into the T20 side.With Sanju Samson, Abhishek Sharma, and Tilak Varma delivering consistently in the shortest format, the management is keen to back them. TOI understands that Gill remains in the selectors’ long-term plans, but not as a frontline T20 option.On the bowling front, Jasprit Bumrah is set to return after overcoming a minor knee concern, while Mohammed Siraj could be rested following a heavy workload in England.Arshdeep Singh, Hardik Pandya, and Prasidh Krishna are likely seam-bowling options, with spinners Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, and Washington Sundar in contention for the UAE’s slow pitches.India are grouped with Pakistan, UAE, and Oman in the Asia Cup. They will open their campaign against UAE on September 10 in Dubai, before the much-anticipated clash against Pakistan on September 14.The women’s selection meeting will also take place later in the day, at 3:30 PM, to finalise India’s squad for the ODI series against Australia and the ICC Women’s World Cup.READ FULL STORY06:48 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Kuldeep Yadav + Varun Chakravarthy - India’s surprise Asia Cup weapon?The spin duo of Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy will be eagerly awaiting the selectors’ call as India’s squad for the Asia Cup 2025, scheduled from September 9, is set to be announced. Both would be keen to get their hands on leather and rattle the opposition.The two spinners come into the tournament with different recent history.Kuldeep spent the entire tour of England on the bench. Carrying drinks, passing on messages from the coaching staff, and quietly watching his teammates from the dressing room was all the chinaman managed over five Tests.Now, with the Asia Cup squad to be revealed on Tuesday (August 19), Kuldeep will be hoping to don the India blues, even if he didn't get the chance to wear the whites.The 30-year-old last featured in a T20I in the 2024 T20 World Cup, where he picked up 10 wickets in five matches. Overall, Kuldeep has played 40 T20Is, claiming 69 wickets, including two five-wicket hauls.Known for his deceptive wrong ’uns and sharp flippers, he remains a potent threat to batters, especially in UAE's spin-friendly conditions.While Kuldeep hasn’t played a T20I in the UAE, he has featured in ODIs there. He was also part of India’s victorious squads in the 2018 and 2023 editions of the Asia Cup (both in the ODI format).Varun Chakravarthy, meanwhile, has been in excellent form since making his international return last year.The 33-year-old mystery spinner, armed with nine different variations, has already produced match-winning spells, including two five-wicket hauls in T20Is and another in ODIs during India’s ICC Champions Trophy triumph.In his short T20I career so far, he has bagged 33 wickets in 18 matches.READ FULL STORY06:26 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: All-rounders and KeepersWith Nitish Kumar Reddy and Rishabh Pant still recovering from injuries, Shivam Dube is set to be the second seam-bowling all-rounder behind Pandya. The wicketkeeper debate is between Jitesh Sharma and Dhruv Jurel. Jitesh strengthened his case with impactful lower-order cameos during Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s title-winning IPL season, while Jurel has been a rising name in the mix.06:25 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Spin OptionsAmong spinners, Axar Patel, Varun Chakravarthy, and Kuldeep Yadav appear first-choice, with Washington Sundar likely to be included thanks to Gambhir’s preference for all-rounders. Conditions in Dubai and Abu Dhabi may not be as slow as in the Champions Trophy, but spin will still play a significant role.06:25 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Pacers’ PuzzleHardik Pandya doubles up as a frontline seamer alongside Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh, leaving one spot for a reserve quick. Harshit Rana is currently the frontrunner, with Prasidh Krishna and Mohammed Siraj seen more as red-ball specialists. With a home series against West Indies looming in October, Bumrah could even be rested, allowing Prasidh and Siraj opportunities.06:24 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: 'Sweet' headache for selectorsAs India’s selectors sit down on Tuesday to finalise the 15-member squad for the Asia Cup in the UAE, their biggest challenge could be fitting Shubman Gill into an already stable T20 set-up.Gill, who has enjoyed a stellar run as Test captain in England, has struggled to slot seamlessly into the current T20 combination.

The tournament, featuring eight teams, will begin September 30 with India hosting all matches except Pakistan's games, which will be played in Colombo.   India enters the World Cup with strong momentum after defeating England in white-ball series and winning the ODI tri-series involving Sri Lanka and South Africa in April. The team will also host Australia for three ODIs as part of their preparation.   The selectors face a crucial decision regarding Shafali Verma's inclusion in the batting lineup. Since her return against England, she has shown mixed form with scores of 3, 47, 31, and 75, followed by underwhelming performances against Australia A scoring 3, 3, and 41.   The current batting order appears settled with Smriti Mandhana and Pratika Rawal opening, supported by Jemimah Rodrigues, Harleen Deol, and captain Harmanpreet Kaur in the middle order.   Renuka Thakur's fitness assessment will be another key consideration. The premier seam bowler has been sidelined since March, and her recovery status will be evaluated considering the upcoming World Cup's workload demands.   Richa Ghosh is set to be the primary wicketkeeper, with Yastika Bhatia, who recently scored two fifties against Australia A in Brisbane, as a potential backup. 12:29 (IST) Aug 19Women's World Cup Squad Live: Tournament Details OutThe ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025 will run from September 30 to November 2.

Back then, for women’s cricket, that wasn’t normal. The players were shocked to see so many people,” she said, calling it a turning point for the women’s game in India.10:46 (IST) Aug 19Women's World Cup India Team Squad Live: Jemimah on WPL EffectWith 50 days to go for the ICC Women’s World Cup 2025, Jemimah Rodrigues credited the Women’s Premier League for giving young players the confidence to excel on the international stage. She highlighted pacer Kranti Gaud’s fearless bowling in England, where the 22-year-old emerged as the leading wicket-taker with nine scalps, including a stunning six-for.10:39 (IST) Aug 19Women's World Cup Squad Live:  Focus on Present, Not MilestonesFresh from series wins in England (2-1 T20Is, 3-2 ODIs), Mandhana stressed that the team is concentrating only on preparations. “Whenever we’ve done well, everything else has taken care of itself.

Stay tuned. Women's World Cup India Team Squad Live: The selection committee led by Neetu David is set to announce India's Women's ODI World Cup squad and the team for the three-match home ODI series against Australia on Tuesday afternoon. The same squad is likely to be chosen for both events, with only minimal changes possible based on the decisions of the five-member selection committee and team management.

The selection committee is also expected to pick an India A team for the World Cup warm-up game against South Africa at the BCCI Centre of Excellence Ground in Bengaluru.

The first two women's ODIs between India and Australia will be held at the Mullanpur stadium on September 14 and 17, followed by the final match at New Delhi's Arun Jaitley Stadium on September 20.

Mullanpur will host women's international cricket for the first time, while New Delhi will stage a women's ODI after nearly 28 years.

The Indian team, under Harmanpreet Kaur's leadership, enters its final World Cup preparation phase after successful ODI tri-series victory in Sri Lanka and white-ball series wins in England.

Smriti Mandhana, Harmanpreet Kaur, Jemimah Rodrigues, and Richa Ghosh are confirmed for the batting lineup. Pratika Rawal, who has scored 703 runs since her debut last year, and Harleen Deol are likely to continue, with Yastika Bhatia as second wicketkeeper.

Shafali Verma's selection remains uncertain due to inconsistent performance. Despite head coach Amol Muzumdar indicating her consideration for World Cup selection, her recent scores in Australia have been modest.

Amanjot Kaur, who replaced the injured Pooja Vastrakar, faces careful workload management due to a back injury from the England ODI series. While cleared to play, she might be reserved for crucial World Cup matches.TrendingKagiso RabadaAUS vs SA Live ScoreSuryakumar YadavAbhishek SharmaIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIga SwiatekWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementCarlos AlcarazVarun ChakravarthyRohit SharmaKagiso RabadaAUS vs SA Live ScoreSuryakumar YadavAbhishek SharmaIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIga SwiatekWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementCarlos AlcarazVarun ChakravarthyRohit SharmaKagiso RabadaAUS vs SA Live ScoreSuryakumar YadavAbhishek SharmaIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIga SwiatekWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementCarlos AlcarazVarun ChakravarthyRohit SharmaTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTop Stories Right NowRussell Wilson's wife Ciara becomes first descendants of enslaved Africans to re...Stephen Curry’s wife Ayesha Curry shares an unforgettable moment of baby Cai wal...Maple Leafs fans on edge as Connor McDavid’s new contract update sparks speculat...More TOP StoriesQuick LinksWTC Points TableNHL NewsNBA NewsEsports and Gaming NewsLatest Cricket NewsWWE NewsCricket Match ScheduleInternational SportsMLB NewsNFL NewsEducation NewsLive Cricket ScoreExplore Every CornerAcross The GlobeIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementICAI CA Admit CardAUS vs SA LiveVP CandidateShubhanshu ShuklaMumbai RainsSimone TataAlaska MeetWang YiCP RadhakrishnanRahul GandhiZelenskyyHarjinder SinghGiorgia MeloniIsraeli Intel ChiefKristi NoemWWE Raw ResultsDubai Pink DiamondGST RatesWang YiUS Student VisaFASTag Annual PassBank Holidays AugustHamas CeasefireMumbai school closedRJS Prelims ResultStephanie WhiteTyson BagentConnor McDavidAbout usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesLiving and EntertainmentCricbuzzLifestyleNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTVTimes PrimeTravel DestinationsWhats HotETimesTimes LifeTimes PetsMyLifeXPServicesCouponDuniaTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgetsTimes EventsWork with UsColombiaHot on the WebAchyut Potdar Death NewsVitamins For Hair GrowthKidney Disease SymptomsCloves Health BenefitsReverse Fatty LiverTulsi Health BenefitsAbhinav ShuklaBlood Pressure ManagementAR MurugadossLongest International RiverSaswata ChatterjeeLow Value CurrencyLow CholesterolAmeesha PatelKidney Cancer SymptomsArmaan MalikCancer RiskJaanWorst States In AmericaFaissal KhanLiver Disease SymptomsAngelina JolieMonsoon Snake PreventionBlood Pressure ManagementWar 2 Box Office CollectionArchana Puran SinghCoolie Movie ReviewCoolie Box Office CollectionMahavatar Narsimha Box Office CollectionGarlic BenefitsDarshan ThoogudeepaColon Cancer SymptomsSanskrit EffectNatural SupplementsHigh Cholesterol SymptomsSide Effects Of Dragon FruitColorectal CancerOral SymptomsReduce Face Fat DietSide Effects Of BananasGinger Tea Side EffectsKidney Damage SymptomsTrending TopicsMadison BeerAdam SchefterNFL New DealTravis KelceDonald TrumpD GukeshUPSC EPFO RecruitmentWho is Anmoljit SinghMDSU BA SEM 1 ResultSBI PO Prelims ResultAbhishek SharmaAmbati RayuduRohit SharmaWho is Brian OkelleyNEET UG CounsellingBihar Jeevika RecruitmentWB NEET UG CounsellingNEET PG Result 2025Sarfaraz KhanDelhi Girl RescueMumbai Red AlertOperation SindoorMeerut Army Jawan AssaultedManish SisodiaSurat Phone in WashroomMumbai Travel AdvisoryMumbai RainsDwarka Expressway UER 2 InaugurationDelhi RapeAir India Flight NewsJeff BezosFastag Annual PassAnupam MittalGeoffrey HintonSridhar VembuApple iPhone 17Nyt ConnectionsMega Tsunami WarningAirtel DownJamie DimonWordle TodaySteve JobsPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth+ TipsIndian TV ShowsTechnologyTravelEtimesHealth & FitnessNFLAugust Long Weekend 2025India vs EnglandAstrologyWeather TodayPlatinum Rate TodaySilver Rate TodayGold Rate TodayIs Bank open todayIs Bank Open TomorrowBank Holidays in AugustPublic Holidays in AugustStock Market HolidaysFinancial CalculatorsTechnology NewsInternational SportsPublic HolidaysBank HolidaysLatest NewsUS Open 2025: Mixed doubles offers big names, big money and big question markUAE: Falcon prices hit $10,000 at Abu Dhabi auctions ahead of major hunting and equestrian expoNo 'harsh action' against strays till SC order: Delhi CM Rekha GuptaIs Vietnam going too far with its tax revolution?'Paradha' pre-release event: Director Praveen Kandregula says women-centric films deserve box office wins too - ReadHate crime in UK: Teenagers attack Sikh men, remove their turbans - videoThiruvananthapuram Medical College bars faculty from public criticism of govt policies, institutional matterAmbulance row: TN health minister Ma Subramanian slams Edappadi K Palaniswami over threat to staff;

Marsh, who led Australia to a 2-1 victory in the T20I series, will continue his captaincy role as regular captain Pat Cummins takes a rest.   The Australian team successfully implemented an attacking strategy from the start in the T20I series, though it occasionally resulted in batting collapses.   "Getting ready to spend three and a half hours in the field will be a little bit different for a few of the boys. But as a group and as a whole, nothing really changes. (There's a) bit of a mindset change, it's obviously different format. But the same stuff rolls on," Marsh told reporters on Monday.   Marsh has experience leading Australia in ODIs, having captained nine times previously, including tours to South Africa in 2023 and England in 2024 when Cummins was unavailable.   The Australian captain suggested they might continue their preference for chasing targets in the ODI series, similar to their T20I approach.   "It's a bit of a common trend, generally speaking, in T20 cricket these days. You get to assess the conditions, but you also just know what you're chasing. I'm certainly not afraid to bat first. But we have lent towards bowling first. Playing with dew is not something that we're used to in Australia. We saw the ball get really soft in Darwin. That's been a different challenge for us," he elaborated.   The ODI series will continue with the second and third matches scheduled at the Great Barrier Reef Arena in Mackay on Friday and Sunday.

Currently, this stand between Matthew Breetzke and skipper Temba Bavuma has stitched together 53 runs, and Australia are in search of a breakthrough. A couple of quick wickets moving towards the climax of the innings could prove handy. But they need them now. A change in bowling as Aaron Hardie returns for another spell. He is 1-0-13-0 so far.

Following his impressive performance in the T20I series, Brevis' entry marks South Africa's preparation for the 2027 ODI World Cup, which they will co-host with Zimbabwe and Namibia.

Temba Bavuma, fresh from lifting the World Test Championship mace at Lord's, will lead the South African side. The team sees the return of Keshav Maharaj in the spin department, while Bavuma has confirmed his position at No. 3 in the batting order.

Wiaan Mulder seeks to build on his bowling success from the Champions Trophy as he aims to cement his place in the 50-over format.

The Australian team faces lineup changes due to injuries to Matt Short, Mitchell Owen, and Lance Morris. This has created opportunities for newcomers Cooper Connolly, Aaron Hardie, and Matt Kuhnemann.

Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc will not participate in the series. Marnus Labuschagne returns to the squad, looking to revive his international career after being dropped from the Test side earlier this year.

Mitchell Marsh will captain the Australian side. He has indicated a preference for bowling first after winning the toss, though dew conditions in Cairns may affect this decision.

The venue's history suggests challenging batting conditions. Previous ODIs between Australia and New Zealand in 2022 saw totals rarely exceeding 267, favoring the bowling sides.

Cameron Green, who scored his highest ODI score of 89 not out at this ground, is expected to play a key role, potentially batting at No. 3.

With three matches scheduled over five days, Australia plans to rotate their fast bowlers, giving South Africa varying bowling combinations to face.

Brevis, known for his aggressive batting style and ability to hit boundaries, represents South Africa's future in ODI cricket as they begin their journey toward the 2027 World Cup.

The series presents an opportunity for both teams to test new talent while maintaining competitive standards in this established cricket rivalry.TrendingKagiso RabadaAUS vs SA Live ScoreSuryakumar YadavAbhishek SharmaIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIga SwiatekWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementCarlos AlcarazVarun ChakravarthyRohit SharmaKagiso RabadaAUS vs SA Live ScoreSuryakumar YadavAbhishek SharmaIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIga SwiatekWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementCarlos AlcarazVarun ChakravarthyRohit SharmaKagiso RabadaAUS vs SA Live ScoreSuryakumar YadavAbhishek SharmaIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIga SwiatekWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementCarlos AlcarazVarun ChakravarthyRohit SharmaTired of too many ads?go ad free nowMatch StatisticsHead to Head in ODITotal Matches 1105155VenueCazaly's Stadium, CairnsAUS PLAYING XIMitchell Marsh (C)Travis HeadMarnus LabuschagneSee AllSA PLAYING XIAiden MarkramRyan Rickelton (W)Temba Bavuma (C)See AllTop Stories Right NowRussell Wilson's wife Ciara becomes first descendants of enslaved Africans to re...Stephen Curry’s wife Ayesha Curry shares an unforgettable moment of baby Cai wal...Maple Leafs fans on edge as Connor McDavid’s new contract update sparks speculat...More TOP StoriesQuick LinksWTC Points TableNHL NewsNBA NewsEsports and Gaming NewsLatest Cricket NewsWWE NewsCricket Match ScheduleInternational SportsMLB NewsNFL NewsEducation NewsLive Cricket ScoreExplore Every CornerAcross The GlobeIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementICAI CA Admit CardAUS vs SA LiveVP CandidateShubhanshu ShuklaMumbai RainsSimone TataAlaska MeetWang YiCP RadhakrishnanRahul GandhiZelenskyyHarjinder SinghGiorgia MeloniIsraeli Intel ChiefKristi NoemWWE Raw ResultsDubai Pink DiamondGST RatesWang YiUS Student VisaFASTag Annual PassBank Holidays AugustHamas CeasefireMumbai school closedBattlefield 6Stephanie WhiteTyson BagentConnor McDavidAbout usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesLiving and EntertainmentCricbuzzLifestyleNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTVTimes PrimeTravel DestinationsWhats HotETimesTimes LifeTimes PetsMyLifeXPServicesCouponDuniaTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgetsTimes EventsWork with UsColombiaHot on the WebAchyut Potdar Death NewsVitamins For Hair GrowthKidney Disease SymptomsCloves Health BenefitsReverse Fatty LiverTulsi Health BenefitsAbhinav ShuklaBlood Pressure ManagementAR MurugadossLongest International RiverSaswata ChatterjeeLow Value CurrencyLow CholesterolAmeesha PatelKidney Cancer SymptomsArmaan MalikCancer RiskJaanWorst States In AmericaFaissal KhanLiver Disease SymptomsAngelina JolieMonsoon Snake PreventionBlood Pressure ManagementWar 2 Box Office CollectionArchana Puran SinghCoolie Movie ReviewCoolie Box Office CollectionMahavatar Narsimha Box Office CollectionGarlic BenefitsDarshan ThoogudeepaColon Cancer SymptomsSanskrit EffectNatural SupplementsHigh Cholesterol SymptomsSide Effects Of Dragon FruitColorectal CancerOral SymptomsReduce Face Fat DietSide Effects Of BananasGinger Tea Side EffectsKidney Damage SymptomsTrending TopicsMadison BeerAdam SchefterNFL New DealTravis KelceDonald TrumpKelly StaffordUPSC EPFO RecruitmentWho is Anmoljit SinghMDSU BA SEM 1 ResultSBI PO Prelims ResultAbhishek SharmaAmbati RayuduRohit SharmaWho is Brian OkelleyNEET UG CounsellingBihar Jeevika RecruitmentWB NEET UG CounsellingNEET PG Result 2025Sarfaraz KhanDelhi Girl RescueMumbai Red AlertOperation SindoorMeerut Army Jawan AssaultedManish SisodiaSurat Phone in WashroomMumbai Travel AdvisoryMumbai RainsDwarka Expressway UER 2 InaugurationDelhi RapeAir India Flight NewsJeff BezosFastag Annual PassAnupam MittalGeoffrey HintonSridhar VembuApple iPhone 17Nyt ConnectionsMega Tsunami WarningAirtel DownJamie DimonWordle TodaySteve JobsPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth+ TipsIndian TV ShowsTechnologyTravelEtimesHealth & FitnessNFLAugust Long Weekend 2025India vs EnglandAstrologyWeather TodayPlatinum Rate TodaySilver Rate TodayGold Rate TodayIs Bank open todayIs Bank Open TomorrowBank Holidays in AugustPublic Holidays in AugustStock Market HolidaysFinancial CalculatorsTechnology NewsInternational SportsPublic HolidaysBank HolidaysLatest NewsAugust 2025’s night sky will sparkle with 1,00,000 stars at once: Know when and where to watchRJS 2025 prelims result out on hcraj.nic.in;

Suryakumar Yadav NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Ambati Rayudu has shed new light on one of the most debated moments from the T20 World Cup 2024 final between India and South Africa — Suryakumar Yadav’s boundary catch to dismiss David Miller. According to Rayudu, the catch became possible because the boundary rope had been unintentionally pushed back earlier in the day when broadcast equipment was placed near the rope.Rayudu’s revelation comes more than a year after India’s title-winning final against South Africa, where Suryakumar’s stunning effort at the boundary was remembered as one of the defining moments.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!EXCLUSIVE: India to boycott Pakistan in Asia Cup? Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'The dismissal, which turned out to be a defining moment in India’s triumph, drew scrutiny when replays showed the rope appeared to be positioned differently than usual.Speaking on the Unfiltered Podcast, Rayudu, who was part of the commentary team during the final, explained: "There were world feed commentators. During the break, what usually happens is they put a chair there and a screen in order to help the broadcasters see what is happening. That is why they pushed the rope backwards a little bit. But, they left it like that (even after taking the screen and the chair away). That is how the boundary became a little bigger for us. We (the commentators) could see it from above. It was god's plan."When asked whether the shot would have cleared the boundary under normal circumstances, Rayudu replied:PollDo you agree with Rayudu's statement that 'God was with us'?Yes, it's a matter of fateNo, skill was the deciding factorI think it's a mix of bothI don't believe in fate"I don't know if it was a six (in natural circumstances) or not. If the rope had been placed at its normal position, maybe Surya would've run from inside."Despite the controversy, Rayudu insisted the dismissal was legitimate. "End of the day, God was with us," he said, adding that it was a “clean catch.”The rope placement sparked reactions from several current and former cricketers at the time, though the debate eventually faded.

His explosive IPL seasons and international success, including topping the ICC T20I batting rankings, make him indispensable. Sharma's formidable opening partnership with Sanju Samson and consistent performances solidify his place as India's T20I spearhead. Abhishek Sharma has staked his claim at the top of the order in India's T20 team.  The Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee will convene at the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai on Tuesday to pick India’s squad for the 2025 Asia Cup. The tournament, scheduled in the UAE from September 9–28, will be played in the T20I format, making it an important stepping stone towards the T20 World Cup next year.LIVE: Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIndia, placed in Group A alongside Pakistan, UAE, and Oman, will be watched closely as the selectors look to strike the balance between experience and youth. One name, however, should not even be up for debate — Abhishek Sharma.EXCLUSIVE: India to boycott Pakistan in Asia Cup? Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'From IPL sensation to India’s T20I spearheadAbhishek Sharma’s case for selection writes itself. His rise has been meteoric since his breakthrough IPL 2024 season for Sunrisers Hyderabad, where he hammered 484 runs at a staggering strike rate of 204.21.And if anyone thought 2024 was a one-off, Abhishek proved them wrong with another breathtaking IPL in 2025: 439 runs, which included a highest score of 141, at another stunning strike rate of 193.39. PollDo you believe the selectors should prioritize experience over youth in the squad selection?Yes, experience is crucialNo, youth brings energyThat form translated to the international stage almost instantly. After an anticlimactic four-ball duck on debut against Zimbabwe in July 2024, he responded with a jaw-dropping 100 off 47 balls in the very next match. Since then, the 24-year-old left-hander has not looked back, cementing his place at the top of India’s T20I order.Fast forward a year, and Abhishek sits at the very top of the ICC T20I batting rankings, making him the youngest Indian ever to achieve the No. 1 status in the format. He currently leads the chart ahead of compatriots Tilak Varma (No.2) and Suryakumar Yadav (No.6). That alone is a telling indicator of his indispensability.The numbers don’t lieIndia batter Abhishek Sharma. In 16 T20I innings for India, Abhishek has amassed 535 runs at a blistering strike rate of 193.85 — the highest for any Indian with over 500 runs in the format. His record already features two centuries and two fifties, underlining his ability to provide explosive starts and play match-winning knocks.His most recent masterpiece came against England at the Wankhede Stadium, where he smashed a record-breaking 135 off 54 balls — the highest individual T20I score by an Indian. That innings included 13 sixes and showcased his unmatched ability to dismantle world-class bowling.Crucially, Abhishek has formed a formidable opening partnership with Sanju Samson. Since being paired together against Bangladesh in October 2024, the duo have opened in 12 consecutive matches, giving India explosive starts almost every time.Abhishek Sharma in last 12 T20Is: 411 runs @34.25, SR 200.49 (2 fifties, 1 hundred)Sanju Samson in last 12 T20Is: 417 runs @37.91, SR 183.70 (3 hundreds)India’s record with Abhishek-Samson opening: 10 wins in 12 matchesThese numbers reflect not just individual brilliance but also a stable, high-impact opening formula that has worked wonders for India. The competition: Shubman Gill and Yashasvi JaiswalAbhishek Sharma, Shubman Gill and Yashasvi JaiswalThe selection dilemma lies in who joins Abhishek and Samson as the third opener. Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill, both coming off a prolific Test series in England, will stake their claims. But their T20I credentials have faded in comparison.Jaiswal’s last T20I: July 2024 vs Sri Lanka (10 off 9).Gill’s last T20I: Same match, scoring 39 off 37.Neither has played a T20I in more than a year, while Abhishek has established himself as India’s most consistent powerplay batter. Given the contrasting trajectories, the selectors may consider carrying either Gill or Jaiswal as backup, but dislodging Abhishek is not an option.Why Abhishek Sharma is non-negotiableWorld No.1 T20I batter – His ranking is a reflection of dominance across opponents and conditions.Explosive strike rate – At nearly 194 in internationals and 193.39 in IPL 2025, his scoring rate dwarfs not just Indian contemporaries but also most global stars.Big-match temperament – Two T20I hundreds already, including a record knock against England, underline his ability to step up.Proven opening partnership – The Abhishek-Samson duo has become India’s most reliable T20I opening combo in recent years.Consistency – Back-to-back stellar IPL seasons, apart from international success, have made him the most bankable young T20 batter in India.As India gear up for the Asia Cup, much chatter will swirl around Shubman Gill’s return, Yashasvi Jaiswal’s case, or middle-order reshuffles. But in the opening slot, there is no ambiguity. Abhishek Sharma has evolved from a promising IPL star into India’s T20I batting spearhead, with numbers, form, and rankings all backing his claim.The selectors may face tough calls in other departments, but when it comes to Abhishek, the decision is straightforward. He is not just a part of India’s Asia Cup squad — he is the foundation on which their T20 future must be built.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy  NEW DELHI: The spin duo of Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy will be eagerly awaiting the selectors’ call as India’s squad for the Asia Cup 2025, scheduled from September 9, is set to be announced. Both would be keen to get their hands on leather and rattle the opposition.The two spinners come into the tournament with different recent history.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!EXCLUSIVE: India to boycott Pakistan in Asia Cup? Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'Kuldeep spent the entire tour of England on the bench. Carrying drinks, passing on messages from the coaching staff, and quietly watching his teammates from the dressing room was all the chinaman managed over five Tests.Now, with the Asia Cup squad to be revealed on Tuesday (August 19), Kuldeep will be hoping to don the India blues, even if he didn't get the chance to wear the whites.The 30-year-old last featured in a T20I in the 2024 T20 World Cup, where he picked up 10 wickets in five matches. Overall, Kuldeep has played 40 T20Is, claiming 69 wickets, including two five-wicket hauls.Known for his deceptive wrong ’uns and sharp flippers, he remains a potent threat to batters, especially in UAE's spin-friendly conditions.While Kuldeep hasn’t played a T20I in the UAE, he has featured in ODIs there. He was also part of India’s victorious squads in the 2018 and 2023 editions of the Asia Cup (both in the ODI format).PollWhat is the key factor for India to succeed in the Asia Cup 2025?Strong batting lineupBowling partnershipsFielding and fitnessTeam strategy and preparationVarun Chakravarthy, meanwhile, has been in excellent form since making his international return last year.The 33-year-old mystery spinner, armed with nine different variations, has already produced match-winning spells, including two five-wicket hauls in T20Is and another in ODIs during India’s ICC Champions Trophy triumph.In his short T20I career so far, he has bagged 33 wickets in 18 matches.PlayerMatchesWktsBBIBBMAveEconSR4w5wKuldeep Yadav40695/175/1714.076.7712.412Varun Chakravarthy18335/175/1714.577.0212.402Kuldeep’s coach Kapil Pandey believes both bowlers are primed to shine at the Asia Cup and could form a dangerous partnership with Varun."Every cricketer feels upset if he doesn’t get a chance. Kuldeep was sad too. But I told him — whatever has gone is gone, it’s time to look forward. He is really looking forward to a chance in the Asia Cup. He is hungry for wickets. India will benefit hugely from Kuldeep. And if he forms a combo with Varun, then the opposition will have a tough time. Varun is a solid bowler. They both complement each other when on the field," Kapil told TimesofIndia.com."Opposition teams were scared of Kuldeep, and now they are scared of Varun too. If India play Pakistan, it will be a night to remember. These two guys will completely outfox them. They will not give them time to think. Kuldeep is very hungry right now," the coach added.India have been placed in Group A alongside Oman, hosts UAE, and arch-rivals Pakistan. Group B consists of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, and Sri Lanka.With the Asia Cup followed by the 2026 T20 World Cup, the tournament provides both Kuldeep and Varun with the perfect opportunity to stake their claim for long-term spots in India’s T20I setup.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Sarfaraz's performance highlights his determination to regain a spot in the Indian Test team. Sarfaraz Khan (PTI Photo) CHENNAI: When some of his Mumbai teammates and TNCA XI players were waiting for the curtains to come down following a rain interruption towards the end of Monday’s play, Sarfaraz Khan was itching to get back on the field. Sarfaraz, who had retired hurt with cramps after smashing 138 (114 balls, 10x4, 6x6), had his pads on and was craving for more on the opening day of the Buchi Babu invitational red-ball tournament at the Gojan ‘B’ Ground here. Courtesy of his stroke-filled ton and halfcenturies from Suved Parkar (72) and Aakash Parkar (67 not out), Mumbai posted a handsome first-innings score of 367-5 at stumps. How Virat Kohli & Ravi Shastri sparked India's Test revolution | Insights from Bharat Arun | #BSEGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!The hunger that Sarfaraz showed reflected the burning desire which he has to get back to India’s Test set-up. The 27-year-old only warmed the bench during the BorderGavaskar Trophy in Australia and was ignored for the recent tour to England. Playing his first competitive longformat match since turning out for India ‘A’ against England Lions, the right-hander, on Monday, was fully immersed in the task of accumulating runs. So much so that he had to be informed by his teammates after completing his century on the stroke of tea. The Mumbai batter brought up his milestone with a Virender Sehwag-esque upper cut over the wicketkeeper’s head, which resulted in a boundary. Up against a not-so-strong bowling attack, Sarfaraz made TNCA XI pay heavily for their drops. He was handed reprieves – both off left-arm spinner M Siddharth’s bowling – on 15 and 121 before deciding to leave the field with cramps. Sarfaraz was particularly severe on the two slow bowlers, Siddharth (he hit him for 49 runs off 42 balls) and off-spinning allrounder Mohamed Ali (28 off 14 balls), as he treated them with disdain. He used his slog-sweeps to good effect to collect many fours in the square leg-midwicket region while opting to access the ‘V’ when trying to clear the fence. Besides his attractive strokemaking, what caught the eye was his eagerness to run hard between the wickets. He put his speed boots on quite a few times, one of the notable moments being him pinching a single a few minutes before suffering a minor setback. Having a leaner frame, a result of his recent transformation, may have helped him in the cause. Sarfaraz, once overlooked by the national selectors for fitness issues despite amassing loads of runs, shed about 17 kgs in a short time in his bid to once again climb to the top. Sarfaraz’s brother Musheer Khan hailed him for putting on another good show. “My bhai has made it a habit to hit tons. We have a good score and hope to score more in the remaining overs (on Tuesday),” Musheer said in a post-day chat.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Bhajji insisted Gill’s solid basics and adaptability make him a potential T20 dominator.

India's player of the series India's captain Shubman Gill on day five of the fifth cricket test match between England and India at The Kia Oval in London, Monday, Aug. 4, 2025. (AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) NEW DELHI: The Asia Cup 2025 India squad is set to be announced, and the burning question is whether Test captain Shubman Gill will find a place in the team. With India’s T20I batting lineup already packed with hard-hitters like Abhishek Sharma, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson, Tilak Varma, captain Suryakumar Yadav, and Hardik Pandya, the selectors face a “sweet headache” when it comes to Gill’s inclusion.India’s top six T20I batters boast impressive strike rates: Abhishek Sharma (193.84), Suryakumar Yadav (167.07), Yashasvi Jaiswal (164.31), Hardik Pandya (141.67), Tilak Varma (155.07), and Sanju Samson (152.38).Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!In comparison, Gill has played 21 T20Is so far, with a strike rate of 139.27.So, will the selectors still back Shubman?Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh, who has closely observed Gill, strongly believes the youngster deserves a place in the squad.“In the T20 format, it’s important to understand that it’s not just about big hitting. If Shubman decides to attack, he can match anyone, because he is a very solid player with strong basics. A batter with such a strong foundation can score runs in any format," Harbhajan told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview."If you look at the IPL, Shubman has scored runs every season. He has worn the Orange Cap — and that doesn’t happen by chance. And it’s not like he bats only at a strike rate of 120 or 130; he can also bat at a strike rate of 160," he added."Yes, we do have players like Abhishek Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, and Tilak Varma, but you cannot undermine or underestimate Shubman Gill. He is a very talented batter who can adapt to any format. He is an all-format player. In my opinion, he can play T20s and even dominate the format. We as fans are used to seeing fours and sixes every ball, but you also need batters who can play long innings and rescue the team when required,” Harbhajan said.When asked to name his 15 for the Asia Cup, which is set to be picked on Tuesday, Harbhajan replied: "I think the squad should be: Yashasvi Jaiswal, Abhishek Sharma, Shubman Gill, Suryakumar Yadav – the captain, Hardik Pandya, Shreyas Iyer, Washington Sundar, Riyan Parag for the middle order, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Mohammed Siraj, Arshdeep Singh, KL Rahul, Jasprit Bumrah and Rishabh Pant.”'CRICKET NEVER STOPS FOR ANYONE'The Asia Cup will mark India’s first major multi-team tournament without stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. The duo featured in India’s previous two global triumphs — the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 and the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 — both won under Rohit’s leadership.This, as Harbhajan puts it, is the beginning of a new era.“See, cricket never stops for anyone. Whether we talk about the time of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, or Sachin Tendulkar, the game has always gone on. Someone or the other comes in and takes the team forward. Right now, the way Shubman Gill and his team-mates have played in England… Rohit and Virat have left their legacy in the right hands. We have seen the shift happen smoothly. It will be a big tournament that will be played without Virat and Rohit," Harbhajan said.PollShould Shubman Gill be included in the Asia Cup 2025 squad?Yes, he deserves a spotNo, we have better options"The way these youngsters have taken responsibility… I believe this is the natural rule of life — change is inevitable. If there is no change, things become stagnant. Moving forward is always good. And the way Shubman Gill and his team-mates have performed, it’s really pleasing to see."Of course, we have seen this shift earlier as well. When the big players move on, someone else steps up, takes responsibility, and carries the team forward. As long as the team keeps moving in the right direction, that is the main goal. The way Gill and his team have played in England, Rohit and Virat have definitely left their legacy in safe hands,” he added.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

He emphasizes the importance of long-term planning for Bumrah's career. Gloster highlights Bumrah's support system and his positive return from injury. He suggests prioritizing Bumrah's longevity over immediate series appearances. Gloster believes Bumrah's management will benefit both the player and Indian cricket. India's Jasprit Bumrah celebrates with teammate Washington Sundar (PTI Photo/R Senthilkumar) Mumbai: At a time when there’s a raging debate amongst former cricketers and journalists around India’s ace pacer Jasprit Bumrah’s workload, following his appearance in just three out of five Tests in the recently held series in England to manage his workload, former Team India physio John Gloster has offered an interesting perspective. Replying to a question on whether Bumrah should be given leeway in choosing which games he would play in a series/tournament, Glosters said, “Look, I know that's a very controversial topic at the moment, and I'll happily tackle most controversial topics. I think that the athlete at the end of the day knows themselves better than anybody.”How Jasprit Bumrah is preparing for Lord's Test - batting, bowling and lot of jokes!Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Speaking at a book launch at the Cricket Club of India on Monday, Gloster said, “Most athletes these days who have good sports teams around them are taking advice from those people. But intuitively, most athletes know what's right and what's wrong. And he is a mature athlete. He’s a smart individual who knows exactly what he’s doing.” The 31-year-old Bumrah took 14 wickets in three Tests at 26.00 in the Tendulkar-Anderson Trophy, and was under fire for missing the crucial third and fifth Tests of the series due to workload management. Overall, Bumrah has taken 219 wickets in 48 Tests at 19.82, with 15 five-wicket hauls, and is set to feature in the Asia Cup, which Gloster felt “should not be a problem, since the tournament will be played in a T20 format and Bumrah has to bowl only four overs in a match.” Making a pertinent point about the need to manage Bumrah’s workload to ensure that he lasts for more years rather than just focusing on how he could play more and more matches in a series, which could put him at risk of burnout or injury, Gloster said, “And I think nine times out of ten, mature athletes who have good support are going to make the right decisions. And what we need to think about is not Bumrah for the next series or the series after that. We've got to think about Bumrah for the next two to three years.”PollHow important is workload management for professional athletes?Very importantSomewhat importantNot importantUnsure “In Jasprit's case, he had significant success when he came back. With the type of injury that he had, or has, he always knew that there were going to be times when it would need to be managed differently in order for him to continue to have success and stay playing at the highest level. And it is through good counsel that he comes to terms with that.” Gloster pointed out that it was crucial in Bumrah’s case that he received the right guidance in terms of his workload and injury management, which meant that a lot of times, there could be “others taking decisions for him,” in order for him to have a long and successful career in international cricket. “He knows that his career and the length of his career, his sporting longevity, is going to be through sound counsel and sound advice. This is what it's going to be like.

This is going to be a tough selection. We have won 17 out of the last 20 T20 matches we played," Chopra told ANI.Regarding pace bowler Jasprit Bumrah, Chopra expressed strong support for his inclusion in the team."He is a generational talent and one of the best that the world has ever seen. If he is available for the Asia Cup and he plays the games that matter, he should be there," Chopra noted.PollShould Shubman Gill be included in the final squad for Asia Cup 2025?YesNoShubman Gill has played 21 T20Is so far, scoring 578 runs in 21 innings at an average of 30 and a strike rate of 139. His international record shows steady progress, but it was IPL 2025 where he found good rhythm. Turning out for Gujarat Titans, Gill scored 650 runs in 15 innings, giving his team consistent starts at the top. For India, however, the opening slots are currently held by Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson, who have partnered each other in the last 12 T20Is. This means Gill will need to push his case strongly to break into the top order.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Don't make him wait. Don't say things like 'let him mature'. He is already playing with remarkable maturity. His shot-making has been on another level. If I were chairman, I would definitely have him in the squad," Srikkanth stated on his YouTube show.The selection discussion involves several established players, including Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson, who have secured their positions with an aggressive approach under coach Gautam Gambhir. Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill and current IPL Orange Cap holder Sai Sudharsan are also in contention.Srikkanth expressed uncertainty about Sanju Samson's inclusion in the squad and outlined his preferred opening combinations."Samson is doubtful, according to me," Srikkanth said. "My first-choice opener is Abhishek Sharma, no doubt. I will have two more openers. My picks would be Vaibhav Suryavanshi or Sai Sudharsan, with Shubman Gill as an option. If I were a selector, I would keep Vaibhav in the 15 for the T20 World Cup. He has been outstanding."PollShould Vaibhav Suryavanshi be included in India's squad for the Asia Cup T20?Yes, absolutely!No, he should wait."I think it should be Yashasvi Jaiswal, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, and Sai Sudharsan. I would take two out of these three. That would be my preference," he added.Since the T20 World Cup final in June 2024, Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson have been India's leading run-scorers in T20 internationals. Both players have received support from the team management, including head coach Gambhir and captain Suryakumar Yadav, for their aggressive batting style.Abhishek has accumulated 535 runs at an average of 33.43 with a strike rate of 193.84, including two centuries during this period. Samson has scored three hundreds in 17 matches at a strike rate of 171.47.However, Samson's recent performance in the five-match series against England has raised concerns. He struggled against short-pitched bowling and recorded three single-digit scores in five innings.Srikkanth, who previously captained a 16-year-old Sachin Tendulkar during his debut in Pakistan in 1989, believes India should not delay incorporating Vaibhav into the national setup as they prepare for next year's T20 World Cup.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

The decision was made to manage Bumrah's workload, despite facing criticism.Bumrah, who has been prone to injuries, participated in the first, third, and fourth Tests while Mohammed Siraj led the pace attack in the remaining matches.Sharma, a former pace bowler himself, compared the situation to following a doctor's advice.Jasprit Bumrah press conference: Hits out at critics, on Lord's Honours Boards, ball controversyGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"If the medical team advises, if the doctor tells me that I have to take antibiotics, then I have to consume them," Sharma said in "The Great Indian Cricket Show" on Doordarshan. "If our physios are telling a player to manage workload, I think we should listen to them because they are the better judges."The comments were made at an event where Prasar Bharati, the country's public service broadcaster, signed a deal with London-based cricket analytics company.Sharma, who had a successful bowling partnership with Kapil Dev and claimed over 125 wickets in Tests and ODIs, expressed confidence in India's chances at the upcoming Asia Cup in the UAE."I know that whoever is selected will be the best for the country. And the kind of cricket we are playing right now, I'm really proud with the way India played in England," he added."And I'm very confident that we are definitely going to win the Asia Cup (to be played in T20 format) because soon after that we are playing the T20 World Cup (in 2026) in India."It's a very big thing when you are playing (the World Cup) in you own backyard. If the intent is right, the results will also be good."The event was attended by notable cricket personalities including Madan Lal from the 1983 World Cup-winning team, former India players Murali Kartik and Aakash Chopra, along with Prasar Bharati Chairman Navneet Kumar Sehgal.When asked about including Test captain Shubman Gill, who scored four centuries in the drawn England series, in the Asia Cup squad under Suryakumar Yadav's leadership, Sharma emphasised the need for selecting the best possible team. "Look, that is up to the selectors what they see. My opinion does not matter because I am no longer the chairman (of selectors), so I will only say that the best possible team should be selected," he stated."We have such good cricketers that not just the top-15 but even if the top-30 are selected, they are all very good. Really proud of them."Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Gill, who has enjoyed a stellar run as Test captain in England, has struggled to slot seamlessly into the current T20 combination. For chief selector Ajit Agarkar and his panel, the question is whether it makes sense to disturb a side that has been functioning smoothly.   The talent pool available only complicates matters. Indian cricket currently has an abundance of options, with multiple players ready to step in for every position. At the top of the batting order alone, six names are in contention.   While Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson, and Tilak Varma impressed last season, Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and IPL’s Orange Cap winner Sai Sudharsan are equally compelling picks.   In spin, the competition is just as tight. Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, and Ravi Bishnoi are all pressing for selection, while veteran Yuzvendra Chahal remains on the fringes.   Inside the team management, there are two schools of thought. Some feel it would be unjust to drop consistent performers in order to bring back a bigger star. Others argue that Gill represents the future of Indian cricket—an all-format captain in the making and a strong commercial face for the game.   But his return won’t be straightforward. Under Suryakumar Yadav’s captaincy, India has won 17 of its last 20 T20Is, a remarkable record achieved without Gill or Jaiswal. Yet, before focusing on Tests, both had been doing well in T20Is and the IPL.   Gill also briefly served as Surya’s deputy before his Test duties took over, with Axar Patel stepping in as vice-captain. Reinstating Gill could leave Axar feeling sidelined, despite his reliable performances.   If Gill is named in the 15, selectors may need to reshuffle the playing XI, forcing one of Abhishek, Sanju, or Tilak out. Rinku Singh could also miss out, particularly since head coach Gautam Gambhir doesn’t believe in a fixed “finisher’s” role, reducing the left-hander’s importance.   Fast Bowling Choices  Hardik Pandya, Jasprit Bumrah, and Arshdeep Singh are certainties, leaving one reserve seamer’s slot up for grabs. Harshit Rana appears to be the front-runner, with Prasidh Krishna and Mohammed Siraj largely seen as red-ball bowlers. With a home series against the West Indies in October, Bumrah may even be rested, giving others a chance.   Spin Department  Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, and Varun Chakravarthy are the leading names, with Washington Sundar likely to make the cut as well, thanks to his all-round abilities. Although conditions in Dubai and Abu Dhabi may not be overly slow, spinners are still expected to have a say.   All-rounders and Keepers  With Nitish Kumar Reddy and Rishabh Pant unavailable due to injuries, Shivam Dube is set to back up Hardik as a seam-bowling all-rounder. For the second wicketkeeper’s role, the contest is between Dhruv Jurel and Jitesh Sharma. Jitesh, who played a key role as a lower-order hitter in Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s IPL triumph, has the edge for the finisher’s slot. 12:54 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: ScheduleIndia will kick off their campaign against the UAE on September 10, while the high-voltage game against Pakistan is scheduled for the 14th, with both fixtures set to be played in Dubai. India will play their final group stage fixture against Oman on September 19 in Abu Dhabi.After the group stage, the tournament will proceed to the Super 4, where the top two teams from each group will qualify. If India finishes at the top of Group A, then all of their Super 4 matches will be held in Dubai. If India finishes second, then one of their Super 4 clashes will be held in Abu Dhabi and the remaining two in Dubai. The Super 4 stage will run from September 20 to 26. Dubai will host the final, which is scheduled for September 28.12:50 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Key talking pointsWith Suryakumar, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel being batting order certainties, it would be interesting to see if Shreyas gets a look in. What really strengthens Shreyas’ case is his spin-hitting prowess, much-improved skills to handle short balls and showing assurance as a reliable middle-order batter for Punjab Kings in IPL 2025.On the other hand, Jitesh’s name is a hot favourite for the reserve keeper-batter slot, who can also play finisher’s role when needed with his power-hitting skills and repertoire of ramps and scoops. Jitesh had a stellar IPL 2025 season with the bat and gloves to help Royal Challengers Bengaluru win its maiden IPL title.Amidst all this, Rinku, who was a part of India’s last T20I assignment against England in January, may just miss out. Rinku has been a designated finisher for both India and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). But a patchy IPL season and what if India seeks an all-rounder to excel in slow conditions in Dubai and Abu Dhabi may conjure up to weaken Rinku’s case.With Nitish Kumar Reddy still undergoing rehab for knee ligament injury, Riyan, Sundar and Shivam Dube shape up as contenders for an all-rounders’ slot. Sundar’s off-spin along with his batting makes him a tempting prospect while Dube is a like-to-like replacement for Nitish in terms of skillsets.Riyan, whose batting and handy spin bowling got him on T20I tours of Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka in 2024, provides the balance, but has not done anything worthwhile yet. With Axar, Kuldeep Yadav, and Varun Chakaravarthy set to helm spin department, it would be interesting to see who between Sundar and Riyan gets selectors’ backing.In fast bowling department, with Hardik, Jasprit Bumrah (provided he’s picked) and Arshdeep Singh around, decision needs to be made on including either of Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna and Harshit Rana. In the end, the Asia Cup squad will be the first glimpse of India’s plans for the World Cup, and debate over inclusions and omissions is certain to continue until the main tournament gets underway.12:38 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Pakistan squadSalman Ali Agha (c), Abrar Ahmed, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Hasan Nawaz, Hussain Talat, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Haris (wk), Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Waseem Jnr, Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, Salman Mirza, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Sufyan Moqim.12:24 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Captain checked inTeam India captain Suryakumar Yadav has arrived at the BCCI HQ ahead of the team selection.11:58 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Gill & JaiswalWhile Abhishek’s spot looks untouchable, the debate intensifies over the third opener. Both Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal last played a T20I in July 2024 and haven’t featured in the format since. Their Test form is strong, but in T20Is, they trail far behind Abhishek’s dominance.11:41 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Update&mdash; AraniBasuTOI (@AraniBasuTOI) 11:39 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: The Samson connectionSince October 2024, Abhishek and Sanju Samson have opened together in 12 consecutive matches, consistently giving India fiery starts.

His record includes two centuries and two fifties, cementing his reputation as a powerplay destroyer.11:20 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Abhishek Sharma – Case Closed?Among the many selection debates, one name stands above the rest — Abhishek Sharma.

The left-arm wrist-spinner last played at the 2024 T20 World Cup, taking 10 wickets in five games. With 69 scalps in 40 T20Is, Kuldeep remains a lethal option in UAE’s spin-friendly conditions.09:46 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Spin & finisher debateThe spin attack looks strong with Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, and Varun Chakravarthy in pole position, while Washington Sundar could be backed by Gambhir for his all-round skills.

Hardik Pandya, Jasprit Bumrah, and Arshdeep Singh are automatic picks, while Harshit Rana is the frontrunner for the reserve seamer slot. With Bumrah likely to be rested for the West Indies series in October, Siraj and Prasidh Krishna stand ready as backups.09:10 (IST) Aug 19Women's World Cup India Team Squad Live: Kranti Goud in the SpotlightAmong established names like Harmanpreet, Smriti, Jemimah, and Deepti, Mithali singled out 22-year-old pacer Kranti Goud as a potential X-factor. With only four ODIs under her belt, Goud impressed with a six-wicket haul in England, and Raj believes her raw pace and grit could be pivotal in India’s World Cup campaign.09:07 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Vice-captaincy conundrumIf Gill is recalled, what happens to leadership hierarchy? Gill earlier served as Suryakumar’s deputy before Test duties. Axar Patel, now vice-captain, has been steady in the role. A reshuffle could create dressing-room unease, adding another layer to the Gill inclusion debate.08:59 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Top-Order congestionIndia’s biggest puzzle lies in the top three. Six names are in contention: Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson, Tilak Varma, Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and Sai Sudharsan. With all in good form, selectors must decide whether to reward consistency or make room for Gill’s star power. One change could unsettle the settled XI.08:52 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Selection Day DilemmaThe Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee meets today with one burning question: how to fit Shubman Gill into India’s in-form T20I setup. Under Suryakumar Yadav’s captaincy, India boast an 85% win record (17 wins in 20 matches), making the task of tweaking the batting order both risky and controversial.08:47 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Women's World Cup squad to be announced todayIndia’s recent run of victories has bolstered confidence but the women’s selection panel, headed by Neetu David, will face some tricky questions on the inclusion of Shafali Verma and pacer Renuka Thakur when it meets here on Tuesday to pick the squad for the ODI World Cup.Apart from Pakistan playing all their matches in Colombo, India will host the 50-over World Cup comprising eight teams from September 30 with their eyes firmly set on an elusive global trophy. Stay tuned for all the live updates. Click here to get all the updates.08:26 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Former selector opinesFormer India cricketer Chetan Sharma has predicted India's victory in the upcoming Asia Cup 2025, which will be held in Dubai and Abu Dhabi from September 9 to 28. The tournament will follow the T20I format and feature eight teams competing across both venues, with Dubai hosting 11 matches and Abu Dhabi hosting eight fixtures."The players who will be selected will be the best for the country, and I am very proud of the way we are playing cricket, the way we played against England. We will win the Asia Cup," Sharma told reporters.The Asian Cricket Council has confirmed the participation of five full member nations - Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka - along with the UAE, Oman, and Hong Kong. The teams have been divided into two groups, with India, Pakistan, UAE, and Oman in Group A, while Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Hong Kong form Group B.08:06 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Top 2 T20I run-scorers for both India and Pakistan won't be part of Asia Cup 2025 - here is whyThe 2025 T20 Asia Cup is set to have a very different look, with the leading run-getters of both India and Pakistan missing from the tournament.For India, stalwarts Rohit Sharma (4,231 runs) and Virat Kohli (4,188 runs) have already bid farewell to T20 internationals. On the other hand, Pakistan’s selectors have taken a bold step by leaving out Babar Azam (4,223 runs) and Mohammad Rizwan (3,414 runs) from the 17-member squad announced on Sunday.Pakistan, under new captain Salman Ali Agha, will warm up for the Asia Cup with a tri-series against Afghanistan and the UAE in Sharjah from August 29 to September 7. The continental showpiece kicks off in the Emirates on September 9.The exclusion of Babar and Rizwan has triggered intense debate across cricketing circles, especially considering the pair played pivotal roles in Pakistan’s iconic 10-wicket victory over India at the 2021 T20 World Cup.READ FULL STORY07:36 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: 'Don’t make Vaibhav Suryavanshi wait'Former India skipper Kris Srikkanth has backed 14-year-old sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi for a place in India’s 15-member squad for the Asia Cup T20, which begins on September 9. His endorsement comes just days before the selectors meet on August 19 to finalise the squad, with stiff competition for spots—particularly at the top of the order.Vaibhav has rapidly risen as a serious contender after a breakout season in IPL 2025, where he amassed 252 runs in just seven matches for the Rajasthan Royals at a strike rate of over 200. His whirlwind 35-ball century against Gujarat Titans was the second-fastest ton in IPL history, further cementing his reputation as one of the brightest young batting talents.The teenager carried that momentum into the U19 tour of England, where he struck a century and impressed across both one-day and four-day formats, showcasing his adaptability and temperament at the highest junior level."You have to play bold. Don't make him wait. Don't say things like 'let him mature'. He is already playing with remarkable maturity. His shot-making has been on another level. If I were chairman, I would definitely have him in the squad," Srikkanth stated on his YouTube show.READ FULL STORY07:06 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: All you need to know!When and where will 15-member side be announced? DateTimingVenue confirmedThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will unveil its 15-member squad for the ACC Men’s Asia Cup 2025 on Tuesday, following a high-profile selection meeting in Mumbai. The Senior Men’s Selection Committee will gather at the BCCI headquarters, with the squad announcement scheduled for 1:30 PM (IST) on the 4th floor of the BCCI HQ.The press conference will be attended by India’s T20 captain and the chairman of selectors.The Asia Cup, to be played in the T20 format in the UAE from September 9 to 28, comes just a year after India lifted the 2024 T20 World Cup.Naturally, the spotlight is on continuity and trust in the young T20 specialists who powered India’s success.Suryakumar Yadav is expected to continue as captain, having cleared his fitness test at the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence.According to a report from TOI, star opener Shubman Gill, despite stellar Test and IPL performances, may find it difficult to break into the T20 side.With Sanju Samson, Abhishek Sharma, and Tilak Varma delivering consistently in the shortest format, the management is keen to back them. TOI understands that Gill remains in the selectors’ long-term plans, but not as a frontline T20 option.On the bowling front, Jasprit Bumrah is set to return after overcoming a minor knee concern, while Mohammed Siraj could be rested following a heavy workload in England.Arshdeep Singh, Hardik Pandya, and Prasidh Krishna are likely seam-bowling options, with spinners Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, and Washington Sundar in contention for the UAE’s slow pitches.India are grouped with Pakistan, UAE, and Oman in the Asia Cup. They will open their campaign against UAE on September 10 in Dubai, before the much-anticipated clash against Pakistan on September 14.The women’s selection meeting will also take place later in the day, at 3:30 PM, to finalise India’s squad for the ODI series against Australia and the ICC Women’s World Cup.READ FULL STORY06:48 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Kuldeep Yadav + Varun Chakravarthy - India’s surprise Asia Cup weapon?The spin duo of Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy will be eagerly awaiting the selectors’ call as India’s squad for the Asia Cup 2025, scheduled from September 9, is set to be announced. Both would be keen to get their hands on leather and rattle the opposition.The two spinners come into the tournament with different recent history.Kuldeep spent the entire tour of England on the bench. Carrying drinks, passing on messages from the coaching staff, and quietly watching his teammates from the dressing room was all the chinaman managed over five Tests.Now, with the Asia Cup squad to be revealed on Tuesday (August 19), Kuldeep will be hoping to don the India blues, even if he didn't get the chance to wear the whites.The 30-year-old last featured in a T20I in the 2024 T20 World Cup, where he picked up 10 wickets in five matches. Overall, Kuldeep has played 40 T20Is, claiming 69 wickets, including two five-wicket hauls.Known for his deceptive wrong ’uns and sharp flippers, he remains a potent threat to batters, especially in UAE's spin-friendly conditions.While Kuldeep hasn’t played a T20I in the UAE, he has featured in ODIs there. He was also part of India’s victorious squads in the 2018 and 2023 editions of the Asia Cup (both in the ODI format).Varun Chakravarthy, meanwhile, has been in excellent form since making his international return last year.The 33-year-old mystery spinner, armed with nine different variations, has already produced match-winning spells, including two five-wicket hauls in T20Is and another in ODIs during India’s ICC Champions Trophy triumph.In his short T20I career so far, he has bagged 33 wickets in 18 matches.READ FULL STORY06:26 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: All-rounders and KeepersWith Nitish Kumar Reddy and Rishabh Pant still recovering from injuries, Shivam Dube is set to be the second seam-bowling all-rounder behind Pandya. The wicketkeeper debate is between Jitesh Sharma and Dhruv Jurel. Jitesh strengthened his case with impactful lower-order cameos during Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s title-winning IPL season, while Jurel has been a rising name in the mix.06:25 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Spin OptionsAmong spinners, Axar Patel, Varun Chakravarthy, and Kuldeep Yadav appear first-choice, with Washington Sundar likely to be included thanks to Gambhir’s preference for all-rounders. Conditions in Dubai and Abu Dhabi may not be as slow as in the Champions Trophy, but spin will still play a significant role.06:25 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Pacers’ PuzzleHardik Pandya doubles up as a frontline seamer alongside Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh, leaving one spot for a reserve quick. Harshit Rana is currently the frontrunner, with Prasidh Krishna and Mohammed Siraj seen more as red-ball specialists. With a home series against West Indies looming in October, Bumrah could even be rested, allowing Prasidh and Siraj opportunities.06:24 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: 'Sweet' headache for selectorsAs India’s selectors sit down on Tuesday to finalise the 15-member squad for the Asia Cup in the UAE, their biggest challenge could be fitting Shubman Gill into an already stable T20 set-up.Gill, who has enjoyed a stellar run as Test captain in England, has struggled to slot seamlessly into the current T20 combination. For chief selector Ajit Agarkar and his panel, the question is whether it makes sense to disturb a side that has been functioning smoothly.The talent pool available only complicates matters. Indian cricket currently has an abundance of options, with multiple players ready to step in for every position. At the top of the batting order alone, six names are in contention.While Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson, and Tilak Varma impressed last season, Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and IPL’s Orange Cap winner Sai Sudharsan are equally compelling picks.In spin, the competition is just as tight. Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, and Ravi Bishnoi are all pressing for selection, while veteran Yuzvendra Chahal remains on the fringes.Inside the team management, there are two schools of thought. Some feel it would be unjust to drop consistent performers in order to bring back a bigger star. Others argue that Gill represents the future of Indian cricket—an all-format captain in the making and a strong commercial face for the game.But his return won’t be straightforward. Under Suryakumar Yadav’s captaincy, India has won 17 of its last 20 T20Is, a remarkable record achieved without Gill or Jaiswal. Yet, before focusing on Tests, both had been doing well in T20Is and the IPL.Gill also briefly served as Surya’s deputy before his Test duties took over, with Axar Patel stepping in as vice-captain. Reinstating Gill could leave Axar feeling sidelined, despite his reliable performances.If Gill is named in the 15, selectors may need to reshuffle the playing XI, forcing one of Abhishek, Sanju, or Tilak out. Rinku Singh could also miss out, particularly since head coach Gautam Gambhir doesn’t believe in a fixed “finisher’s” role, reducing the left-hander’s importance.06:23 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Hello and welcome!Hello and welcome to the Live coverage of the India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update.The biggest challenge before India’s selection committee on Tuesday will be finding a way to accommodate Shubman Gill in a well-settled T20 side for next month’s Asia Cup in the UAE.Gill, fresh from a dream run as Test captain in England, has not quite found a natural place in the current T20 set-up that will compete in the continental event from September 9 to 28.

Kagiso Rabada, right, of South Africa celebrates with teammates after taking the wicket of Tim David of Australia during the T20 cricket international between Australia and South Africa at Cazaly's Stadium in Cairns, Australia. AP/PTI(AP08_16_2025_000313A) South Africa's spearhead Kagiso Rabada has been ruled out of the three-match One-Day International series against Australia, starting Tuesday, due to inflammation of his right ankle, Cricket South Africa (CSA) said in a statement."The 30-year-old underwent a scan on Monday, which confirmed the extent of the injury. He will remain in Australia and undergo rehabilitation under the supervision of the Proteas medical staff," CSA said.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

"It's always exciting when you see the young faces. Obviously, the big talk has been on Brevis, (he's been) putting up his hand and showing what he is capable of. (I'm) excited to see what he can also bring within the one-day stuff," said Bavuma to reporters on Monday.PollWho do you think will have a bigger impact in the ODI series?Kwena MaphakaDewald BrevisTemba BavumaKeshav MaharajThe ODI series also marks Bavuma’s return to competitive cricket after leading South Africa to their maiden ICC World Test Championship crown at Lord’s in June.

The tournament, featuring eight teams, will begin September 30 with India hosting all matches except Pakistan's games, which will be played in Colombo.   India enters the World Cup with strong momentum after defeating England in white-ball series and winning the ODI tri-series involving Sri Lanka and South Africa in April. The team will also host Australia for three ODIs as part of their preparation.   The selectors face a crucial decision regarding Shafali Verma's inclusion in the batting lineup. Since her return against England, she has shown mixed form with scores of 3, 47, 31, and 75, followed by underwhelming performances against Australia A scoring 3, 3, and 41.   The current batting order appears settled with Smriti Mandhana and Pratika Rawal opening, supported by Jemimah Rodrigues, Harleen Deol, and captain Harmanpreet Kaur in the middle order.   Renuka Thakur's fitness assessment will be another key consideration. The premier seam bowler has been sidelined since March, and her recovery status will be evaluated considering the upcoming World Cup's workload demands.   Richa Ghosh is set to be the primary wicketkeeper, with Yastika Bhatia, who recently scored two fifties against Australia A in Brisbane, as a potential backup. 12:29 (IST) Aug 19Women's World Cup Squad Live: Tournament Details OutThe ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025 will run from September 30 to November 2.

Back then, for women’s cricket, that wasn’t normal. The players were shocked to see so many people,” she said, calling it a turning point for the women’s game in India.10:46 (IST) Aug 19Women's World Cup India Team Squad Live: Jemimah on WPL EffectWith 50 days to go for the ICC Women’s World Cup 2025, Jemimah Rodrigues credited the Women’s Premier League for giving young players the confidence to excel on the international stage. She highlighted pacer Kranti Gaud’s fearless bowling in England, where the 22-year-old emerged as the leading wicket-taker with nine scalps, including a stunning six-for.10:39 (IST) Aug 19Women's World Cup Squad Live:  Focus on Present, Not MilestonesFresh from series wins in England (2-1 T20Is, 3-2 ODIs), Mandhana stressed that the team is concentrating only on preparations. “Whenever we’ve done well, everything else has taken care of itself.

We know where to work hard and how to implement,” she told ICC.09:45 (IST) Aug 19Women's World Cup Squad Live: Confidence from recent winsWith India set to open their campaign against Sri Lanka on September 30 in Bengaluru, Harmanpreet believes the team carries strong momentum. “The confidence is very high. The kind of cricket we have played over the last couple of years, especially in England, gives us a lot of belief,” the skipper said recently.Don't missanything!Subscribe to our newsletter and get all the stories that matter delivered to your inboxInvalid id.

Add to that the fitness cloud over all-rounder Amanjot Kaur, and the selectors face a tricky puzzle to maintain depth and balance in Harmanpreet Kaur’s side.08:42 (IST) Aug 19Women's World Cup India Team Squad Live: Spin options aboundWith the World Cup in the subcontinent, spinners will be in high demand. Deepti Sharma, Sneh Rana and Radha Yadav remain the frontline options, while youngster N Shree Charani impressed in T20Is against England. The selectors must balance experience with youth in India’s spin-heavy arsenal.08:41 (IST) Aug 19Women's World Cup India Team Squad Live: Renuka Thakur’s Fitness TestThe status of pacer Renuka Thakur is a major concern. Out since March with injury, the right-arm quick could prove crucial with the new ball in Indian conditions. The upcoming ODI series against Australia may act as her comeback stage, provided she clears fitness and workload assessments.08:40 (IST) Aug 19Women's World Cup India Team Squad Live: Spotlight on Shafali VermaShafali Verma’s inclusion remains the talking point. Since her return against England, she scored 3, 47, 31 and 75, but faltered in the Australia A series with twin failures (3, 3, 41).

Stay tuned. Women's World Cup India Team Squad Live: The selection committee led by Neetu David is set to announce India's Women's ODI World Cup squad and the team for the three-match home ODI series against Australia on Tuesday afternoon. The same squad is likely to be chosen for both events, with only minimal changes possible based on the decisions of the five-member selection committee and team management.

The selection committee is also expected to pick an India A team for the World Cup warm-up game against South Africa at the BCCI Centre of Excellence Ground in Bengaluru.

The first two women's ODIs between India and Australia will be held at the Mullanpur stadium on September 14 and 17, followed by the final match at New Delhi's Arun Jaitley Stadium on September 20.

Mullanpur will host women's international cricket for the first time, while New Delhi will stage a women's ODI after nearly 28 years.

The Indian team, under Harmanpreet Kaur's leadership, enters its final World Cup preparation phase after successful ODI tri-series victory in Sri Lanka and white-ball series wins in England.

Smriti Mandhana, Harmanpreet Kaur, Jemimah Rodrigues, and Richa Ghosh are confirmed for the batting lineup. Pratika Rawal, who has scored 703 runs since her debut last year, and Harleen Deol are likely to continue, with Yastika Bhatia as second wicketkeeper.

Shafali Verma's selection remains uncertain due to inconsistent performance. Despite head coach Amol Muzumdar indicating her consideration for World Cup selection, her recent scores in Australia have been modest.

Amanjot Kaur, who replaced the injured Pooja Vastrakar, faces careful workload management due to a back injury from the England ODI series. While cleared to play, she might be reserved for crucial World Cup matches.TrendingKagiso RabadaAUS vs SA Live ScoreSuryakumar YadavAbhishek SharmaIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIga SwiatekWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementCarlos AlcarazVarun ChakravarthyRohit SharmaKagiso RabadaAUS vs SA Live ScoreSuryakumar YadavAbhishek SharmaIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIga SwiatekWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementCarlos AlcarazVarun ChakravarthyRohit SharmaKagiso RabadaAUS vs SA Live ScoreSuryakumar YadavAbhishek SharmaIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIga SwiatekWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementCarlos AlcarazVarun ChakravarthyRohit SharmaTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTop Stories Right NowRussell Wilson's wife Ciara becomes first descendants of enslaved Africans to re...Stephen Curry’s wife Ayesha Curry shares an unforgettable moment of baby Cai wal...Maple Leafs fans on edge as Connor McDavid’s new contract update sparks speculat...More TOP StoriesQuick LinksWTC Points TableNHL NewsNBA NewsEsports and Gaming NewsLatest Cricket NewsWWE NewsCricket Match ScheduleInternational SportsMLB NewsNFL NewsEducation NewsLive Cricket ScoreExplore Every CornerAcross The GlobeIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementICAI CA Admit CardAUS vs SA LiveVP CandidateShubhanshu ShuklaMumbai RainsSimone TataAlaska MeetWang YiCP RadhakrishnanRahul GandhiZelenskyyHarjinder SinghGiorgia MeloniIsraeli Intel ChiefKristi NoemWWE Raw ResultsDubai Pink DiamondGST RatesWang YiUS Student VisaFASTag Annual PassBank Holidays AugustHamas CeasefireMumbai school closedRJS Prelims ResultStephanie WhiteTyson BagentConnor McDavidAbout usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesLiving and EntertainmentCricbuzzLifestyleNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTVTimes PrimeTravel DestinationsWhats HotETimesTimes LifeTimes PetsMyLifeXPServicesCouponDuniaTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgetsTimes EventsWork with UsColombiaHot on the WebAchyut Potdar Death NewsVitamins For Hair GrowthKidney Disease SymptomsCloves Health BenefitsReverse Fatty LiverTulsi Health BenefitsAbhinav ShuklaBlood Pressure ManagementAR MurugadossLongest International RiverSaswata ChatterjeeLow Value CurrencyLow CholesterolAmeesha PatelKidney Cancer SymptomsArmaan MalikCancer RiskJaanWorst States In AmericaFaissal KhanLiver Disease SymptomsAngelina JolieMonsoon Snake PreventionBlood Pressure ManagementWar 2 Box Office CollectionArchana Puran SinghCoolie Movie ReviewCoolie Box Office CollectionMahavatar Narsimha Box Office CollectionGarlic BenefitsDarshan ThoogudeepaColon Cancer SymptomsSanskrit EffectNatural SupplementsHigh Cholesterol SymptomsSide Effects Of Dragon FruitColorectal CancerOral SymptomsReduce Face Fat DietSide Effects Of BananasGinger Tea Side EffectsKidney Damage SymptomsTrending TopicsMadison BeerAdam SchefterNFL New DealTravis KelceDonald TrumpD GukeshUPSC EPFO RecruitmentWho is Anmoljit SinghMDSU BA SEM 1 ResultSBI PO Prelims ResultAbhishek SharmaAmbati RayuduRohit SharmaWho is Brian OkelleyNEET UG CounsellingBihar Jeevika RecruitmentWB NEET UG CounsellingNEET PG Result 2025Sarfaraz KhanDelhi Girl RescueMumbai Red AlertOperation SindoorMeerut Army Jawan AssaultedManish SisodiaSurat Phone in WashroomMumbai Travel AdvisoryMumbai RainsDwarka Expressway UER 2 InaugurationDelhi RapeAir India Flight NewsJeff BezosFastag Annual PassAnupam MittalGeoffrey HintonSridhar VembuApple iPhone 17Nyt ConnectionsMega Tsunami WarningAirtel DownJamie DimonWordle TodaySteve JobsPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth+ TipsIndian TV ShowsTechnologyTravelEtimesHealth & FitnessNFLAugust Long Weekend 2025India vs EnglandAstrologyWeather TodayPlatinum Rate TodaySilver Rate TodayGold Rate TodayIs Bank open todayIs Bank Open TomorrowBank Holidays in AugustPublic Holidays in AugustStock Market HolidaysFinancial CalculatorsTechnology NewsInternational SportsPublic HolidaysBank HolidaysLatest NewsUS Open 2025: Mixed doubles offers big names, big money and big question markUAE: Falcon prices hit $10,000 at Abu Dhabi auctions ahead of major hunting and equestrian expoNo 'harsh action' against strays till SC order: Delhi CM Rekha GuptaIs Vietnam going too far with its tax revolution?'Paradha' pre-release event: Director Praveen Kandregula says women-centric films deserve box office wins too - ReadHate crime in UK: Teenagers attack Sikh men, remove their turbans - videoThiruvananthapuram Medical College bars faculty from public criticism of govt policies, institutional matterAmbulance row: TN health minister Ma Subramanian slams Edappadi K Palaniswami over threat to staff;

His explosive IPL seasons and international success, including topping the ICC T20I batting rankings, make him indispensable. Sharma's formidable opening partnership with Sanju Samson and consistent performances solidify his place as India's T20I spearhead. Abhishek Sharma has staked his claim at the top of the order in India's T20 team.  The Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee will convene at the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai on Tuesday to pick India’s squad for the 2025 Asia Cup. The tournament, scheduled in the UAE from September 9–28, will be played in the T20I format, making it an important stepping stone towards the T20 World Cup next year.LIVE: Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIndia, placed in Group A alongside Pakistan, UAE, and Oman, will be watched closely as the selectors look to strike the balance between experience and youth. One name, however, should not even be up for debate — Abhishek Sharma.EXCLUSIVE: India to boycott Pakistan in Asia Cup? Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'From IPL sensation to India’s T20I spearheadAbhishek Sharma’s case for selection writes itself. His rise has been meteoric since his breakthrough IPL 2024 season for Sunrisers Hyderabad, where he hammered 484 runs at a staggering strike rate of 204.21.And if anyone thought 2024 was a one-off, Abhishek proved them wrong with another breathtaking IPL in 2025: 439 runs, which included a highest score of 141, at another stunning strike rate of 193.39. PollDo you believe the selectors should prioritize experience over youth in the squad selection?Yes, experience is crucialNo, youth brings energyThat form translated to the international stage almost instantly. After an anticlimactic four-ball duck on debut against Zimbabwe in July 2024, he responded with a jaw-dropping 100 off 47 balls in the very next match. Since then, the 24-year-old left-hander has not looked back, cementing his place at the top of India’s T20I order.Fast forward a year, and Abhishek sits at the very top of the ICC T20I batting rankings, making him the youngest Indian ever to achieve the No. 1 status in the format. He currently leads the chart ahead of compatriots Tilak Varma (No.2) and Suryakumar Yadav (No.6). That alone is a telling indicator of his indispensability.The numbers don’t lieIndia batter Abhishek Sharma. In 16 T20I innings for India, Abhishek has amassed 535 runs at a blistering strike rate of 193.85 — the highest for any Indian with over 500 runs in the format. His record already features two centuries and two fifties, underlining his ability to provide explosive starts and play match-winning knocks.His most recent masterpiece came against England at the Wankhede Stadium, where he smashed a record-breaking 135 off 54 balls — the highest individual T20I score by an Indian. That innings included 13 sixes and showcased his unmatched ability to dismantle world-class bowling.Crucially, Abhishek has formed a formidable opening partnership with Sanju Samson. Since being paired together against Bangladesh in October 2024, the duo have opened in 12 consecutive matches, giving India explosive starts almost every time.Abhishek Sharma in last 12 T20Is: 411 runs @34.25, SR 200.49 (2 fifties, 1 hundred)Sanju Samson in last 12 T20Is: 417 runs @37.91, SR 183.70 (3 hundreds)India’s record with Abhishek-Samson opening: 10 wins in 12 matchesThese numbers reflect not just individual brilliance but also a stable, high-impact opening formula that has worked wonders for India. The competition: Shubman Gill and Yashasvi JaiswalAbhishek Sharma, Shubman Gill and Yashasvi JaiswalThe selection dilemma lies in who joins Abhishek and Samson as the third opener. Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill, both coming off a prolific Test series in England, will stake their claims. But their T20I credentials have faded in comparison.Jaiswal’s last T20I: July 2024 vs Sri Lanka (10 off 9).Gill’s last T20I: Same match, scoring 39 off 37.Neither has played a T20I in more than a year, while Abhishek has established himself as India’s most consistent powerplay batter. Given the contrasting trajectories, the selectors may consider carrying either Gill or Jaiswal as backup, but dislodging Abhishek is not an option.Why Abhishek Sharma is non-negotiableWorld No.1 T20I batter – His ranking is a reflection of dominance across opponents and conditions.Explosive strike rate – At nearly 194 in internationals and 193.39 in IPL 2025, his scoring rate dwarfs not just Indian contemporaries but also most global stars.Big-match temperament – Two T20I hundreds already, including a record knock against England, underline his ability to step up.Proven opening partnership – The Abhishek-Samson duo has become India’s most reliable T20I opening combo in recent years.Consistency – Back-to-back stellar IPL seasons, apart from international success, have made him the most bankable young T20 batter in India.As India gear up for the Asia Cup, much chatter will swirl around Shubman Gill’s return, Yashasvi Jaiswal’s case, or middle-order reshuffles. But in the opening slot, there is no ambiguity. Abhishek Sharma has evolved from a promising IPL star into India’s T20I batting spearhead, with numbers, form, and rankings all backing his claim.The selectors may face tough calls in other departments, but when it comes to Abhishek, the decision is straightforward. He is not just a part of India’s Asia Cup squad — he is the foundation on which their T20 future must be built.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy  NEW DELHI: The spin duo of Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy will be eagerly awaiting the selectors’ call as India’s squad for the Asia Cup 2025, scheduled from September 9, is set to be announced. Both would be keen to get their hands on leather and rattle the opposition.The two spinners come into the tournament with different recent history.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!EXCLUSIVE: India to boycott Pakistan in Asia Cup? Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'Kuldeep spent the entire tour of England on the bench. Carrying drinks, passing on messages from the coaching staff, and quietly watching his teammates from the dressing room was all the chinaman managed over five Tests.Now, with the Asia Cup squad to be revealed on Tuesday (August 19), Kuldeep will be hoping to don the India blues, even if he didn't get the chance to wear the whites.The 30-year-old last featured in a T20I in the 2024 T20 World Cup, where he picked up 10 wickets in five matches. Overall, Kuldeep has played 40 T20Is, claiming 69 wickets, including two five-wicket hauls.Known for his deceptive wrong ’uns and sharp flippers, he remains a potent threat to batters, especially in UAE's spin-friendly conditions.While Kuldeep hasn’t played a T20I in the UAE, he has featured in ODIs there. He was also part of India’s victorious squads in the 2018 and 2023 editions of the Asia Cup (both in the ODI format).PollWhat is the key factor for India to succeed in the Asia Cup 2025?Strong batting lineupBowling partnershipsFielding and fitnessTeam strategy and preparationVarun Chakravarthy, meanwhile, has been in excellent form since making his international return last year.The 33-year-old mystery spinner, armed with nine different variations, has already produced match-winning spells, including two five-wicket hauls in T20Is and another in ODIs during India’s ICC Champions Trophy triumph.In his short T20I career so far, he has bagged 33 wickets in 18 matches.PlayerMatchesWktsBBIBBMAveEconSR4w5wKuldeep Yadav40695/175/1714.076.7712.412Varun Chakravarthy18335/175/1714.577.0212.402Kuldeep’s coach Kapil Pandey believes both bowlers are primed to shine at the Asia Cup and could form a dangerous partnership with Varun."Every cricketer feels upset if he doesn’t get a chance. Kuldeep was sad too. But I told him — whatever has gone is gone, it’s time to look forward. He is really looking forward to a chance in the Asia Cup. He is hungry for wickets. India will benefit hugely from Kuldeep. And if he forms a combo with Varun, then the opposition will have a tough time. Varun is a solid bowler. They both complement each other when on the field," Kapil told TimesofIndia.com."Opposition teams were scared of Kuldeep, and now they are scared of Varun too. If India play Pakistan, it will be a night to remember. These two guys will completely outfox them. They will not give them time to think. Kuldeep is very hungry right now," the coach added.India have been placed in Group A alongside Oman, hosts UAE, and arch-rivals Pakistan. Group B consists of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, and Sri Lanka.With the Asia Cup followed by the 2026 T20 World Cup, the tournament provides both Kuldeep and Varun with the perfect opportunity to stake their claim for long-term spots in India’s T20I setup.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Revelation! 'Pushed the rope backwards': Ex-cricketer on Surya's catch
Ambati Rayudu has revealed that the boundary rope in the T20 World Cup final between India and South Africa was unintentionally moved back due to broadcast equipment. This adjustment, according to Rayudu, played a crucial role in Suryakumar Yadav's catch to dismiss David Miller. Despite the controversy, Rayudu maintains the catch was legitimate, attributing India's triumph to divine intervention.

Suryakumar Yadav NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Ambati Rayudu has shed new light on one of the most debated moments from the T20 World Cup 2024 final between India and South Africa — Suryakumar Yadav’s boundary catch to dismiss David Miller. According to Rayudu, the catch became possible because the boundary rope had been unintentionally pushed back earlier in the day when broadcast equipment was placed near the rope.Rayudu’s revelation comes more than a year after India’s title-winning final against South Africa, where Suryakumar’s stunning effort at the boundary was remembered as one of the defining moments.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!EXCLUSIVE: India to boycott Pakistan in Asia Cup? Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'The dismissal, which turned out to be a defining moment in India’s triumph, drew scrutiny when replays showed the rope appeared to be positioned differently than usual.Speaking on the Unfiltered Podcast, Rayudu, who was part of the commentary team during the final, explained: "There were world feed commentators. During the break, what usually happens is they put a chair there and a screen in order to help the broadcasters see what is happening. That is why they pushed the rope backwards a little bit. But, they left it like that (even after taking the screen and the chair away). That is how the boundary became a little bigger for us. We (the commentators) could see it from above. It was god's plan."When asked whether the shot would have cleared the boundary under normal circumstances, Rayudu replied:PollDo you agree with Rayudu's statement that 'God was with us'?Yes, it's a matter of fateNo, skill was the deciding factorI think it's a mix of bothI don't believe in fate"I don't know if it was a six (in natural circumstances) or not. If the rope had been placed at its normal position, maybe Surya would've run from inside."Despite the controversy, Rayudu insisted the dismissal was legitimate. "End of the day, God was with us," he said, adding that it was a “clean catch.”The rope placement sparked reactions from several current and former cricketers at the time, though the debate eventually faded.

While enjoying his luxurious cars, Sharma is preparing for his potential final international series in Australia this October. Rohit Sharma NEW DELHI: Not even heavy Mumbai rains can keep Rohit Sharma indoors. The Indian cricket star was recently spotted driving his sleek black Range Rover through the city, enjoying the monsoon showers in style.The Range Rover is one of Rohit’s trusted rides, but it’s far from the only head-turner in his enviable garage. Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!EXCLUSIVE | Harbhajan Singh on Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Shubman Gill, India vs Pakistan and moreJust a couple of days ago, the 37-year-old added a fiery red Lamborghini Urus SE to his growing luxury car collection and wasted no time taking it out for a drive. Fans quickly gathered on the streets of Mumbai as Rohit, behind the wheel of the brand-new SUV, cruised through the city.What caught everyone’s attention, apart from the stunning machine itself, was the personalised number plate — 3015. The digits carry deep personal meaning, combining his daughter Samaira’s birthday (December 30) and son Ahaan’s birthday (November 15). Together, the numbers add up to 45, Rohit’s iconic jersey number. His previous car carried the number 264, a nod to his world-record ODI score against Sri Lanka in 2014.The Urus SE itself is a beast on wheels, packing 800hp and 950Nm of torque, capable of hitting 0–100 km/h in just 3.4 seconds. Priced at around Rs 4.57 crore (ex-showroom), it is the latest jewel in a collection that also includes a BMW M5 (Rs 1.99 crore), Mercedes-Benz GLS 400d (Rs 1.58 crore), Mercedes-Benz S-Class (Rs 1.98 crore), and a Range Rover HSE LWB (Rs 3.68 crore).WATCH:While his garage continues to expand, Rohit’s cricketing journey is entering a decisive phase. Having last turned out for the Mumbai Indians in IPL 2025, he is gearing up for what could be his final international series. With the Bangladesh ODIs in August cancelled, India’s next assignment will be a three-match ODI series in Australia from October 19–25, where Rohit is expected to make a return.For now, the former India captain seems to be striking the perfect balance — working hard on his cricket while enjoying life off the field, whether it’s in the nets or behind the wheel of his favourite cars.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

SUBSCRIBE NOW!"I'm disappointed, I didn't feel great from yesterday," Sinner said afterwards. "During the night, I thought I would recover a bit better, but it was not the case. "I just tried to go out for the fans, trying to give (them) a match - that's the reason why I went on the court."But it was not meant to be for me today. But I don't want to take anything away from Carlos. He had a great week, great, great tournament again."Sinner said he is now pointing to the final Grand Slam of the season."The main focus, obviously, is for the US Open. Recovery is the most important. And then we see," he said.Despite the temporary health setback, Sinner is pleased with his showings in 2025."I feel like it's an incredible season," he said. "We'll keep going, keep pushing. I have some points to improve if I want to go far in US Open.

New York is a place that I love playing...it is where I got my first Grand Slam."I appreciate the love and the support that I received there every every year... last year it was disappointing, the level that I played there.

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Surya secure as leader? Suryakumar Yadav, after clearing a BCCI fitness test, is set to continue as T20 captain, potentially through to the 2026 T20 World Cup.The Gill dilemma: Despite Shubman Gill’s stellar IPL-2025 (650 runs, avg 50, strike-rate 155.87 as Gujarat Titans skipper), selectors are likely to exclude him from the Asia Cup squad. The focus is likely to be on boundary-hitting prowess. Samson, Abhishek to open? Sanju Samson (three T20I hundreds last year) and Abhishek Sharma (explosive 135 vs England earlier this year) are seen as firstchoice openers. Tilak Varma at No. 3: Despite an average IPL, Varma’s two T20I hundreds in South Africa guarantee his spot, highlighting the priority of international form over IPL stats. Jaiswal as third opener? Yashasvi Jaiswal is touted to be the preferred third opener over Gill, primarily due to his hitting abilities in the Powerplay. What happens to Shreyas Iyer? Shreyas Iyer, despite a strong IPL (captaining Punjab Kings to the final) and top-scoring in the 2025 Champions Trophy (243 runs), faces stiff competition from left-handed big-hitters like Shivam Dube and Rinku Singh.Bumrah good to go: The ace pacer has confirmed his availability. Meanwhile, Mohammed Siraj has been rested. Expect Arshdeep Singh, Prasidh Krishna (IPL Purple Cap with 25 wickets) and Harshit Rana to fill the quota of fast bowlers in the squad. Spin arsenal: Varun Chakravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Washington Sundar and Axar Patel are locked in for the pitches in UAE, blending attack and allround abilities. Jitesh in the fray: Jitesh Sharma, IPL champion with RCB, is likely to get the nod as backup ’keeper due to his finishing skills.

Exclusive | 'Don't underestimate Shubman Gill' - Harbhajan Singh
With the Asia Cup 2025 squad set to be announced, Harbhajan Singh has backed Shubman Gill for inclusion despite stiff competition from India’s power-hitters.

India's player of the series India's captain Shubman Gill on day five of the fifth cricket test match between England and India at The Kia Oval in London, Monday, Aug. 4, 2025. (AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) NEW DELHI: The Asia Cup 2025 India squad is set to be announced, and the burning question is whether Test captain Shubman Gill will find a place in the team. With India’s T20I batting lineup already packed with hard-hitters like Abhishek Sharma, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson, Tilak Varma, captain Suryakumar Yadav, and Hardik Pandya, the selectors face a “sweet headache” when it comes to Gill’s inclusion.India’s top six T20I batters boast impressive strike rates: Abhishek Sharma (193.84), Suryakumar Yadav (167.07), Yashasvi Jaiswal (164.31), Hardik Pandya (141.67), Tilak Varma (155.07), and Sanju Samson (152.38).Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!In comparison, Gill has played 21 T20Is so far, with a strike rate of 139.27.So, will the selectors still back Shubman?Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh, who has closely observed Gill, strongly believes the youngster deserves a place in the squad.“In the T20 format, it’s important to understand that it’s not just about big hitting. If Shubman decides to attack, he can match anyone, because he is a very solid player with strong basics. A batter with such a strong foundation can score runs in any format," Harbhajan told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview."If you look at the IPL, Shubman has scored runs every season. He has worn the Orange Cap — and that doesn’t happen by chance. And it’s not like he bats only at a strike rate of 120 or 130; he can also bat at a strike rate of 160," he added."Yes, we do have players like Abhishek Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, and Tilak Varma, but you cannot undermine or underestimate Shubman Gill. He is a very talented batter who can adapt to any format. He is an all-format player. In my opinion, he can play T20s and even dominate the format. We as fans are used to seeing fours and sixes every ball, but you also need batters who can play long innings and rescue the team when required,” Harbhajan said.When asked to name his 15 for the Asia Cup, which is set to be picked on Tuesday, Harbhajan replied: "I think the squad should be: Yashasvi Jaiswal, Abhishek Sharma, Shubman Gill, Suryakumar Yadav – the captain, Hardik Pandya, Shreyas Iyer, Washington Sundar, Riyan Parag for the middle order, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Mohammed Siraj, Arshdeep Singh, KL Rahul, Jasprit Bumrah and Rishabh Pant.”'CRICKET NEVER STOPS FOR ANYONE'The Asia Cup will mark India’s first major multi-team tournament without stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. The duo featured in India’s previous two global triumphs — the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 and the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 — both won under Rohit’s leadership.This, as Harbhajan puts it, is the beginning of a new era.“See, cricket never stops for anyone. Whether we talk about the time of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, or Sachin Tendulkar, the game has always gone on. Someone or the other comes in and takes the team forward. Right now, the way Shubman Gill and his team-mates have played in England… Rohit and Virat have left their legacy in the right hands. We have seen the shift happen smoothly. It will be a big tournament that will be played without Virat and Rohit," Harbhajan said.PollShould Shubman Gill be included in the Asia Cup 2025 squad?Yes, he deserves a spotNo, we have better options"The way these youngsters have taken responsibility… I believe this is the natural rule of life — change is inevitable. If there is no change, things become stagnant. Moving forward is always good. And the way Shubman Gill and his team-mates have performed, it’s really pleasing to see."Of course, we have seen this shift earlier as well. When the big players move on, someone else steps up, takes responsibility, and carries the team forward. As long as the team keeps moving in the right direction, that is the main goal. The way Gill and his team have played in England, Rohit and Virat have definitely left their legacy in safe hands,” he added.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

This is going to be a tough selection. We have won 17 out of the last 20 T20 matches we played," Chopra told ANI.Regarding pace bowler Jasprit Bumrah, Chopra expressed strong support for his inclusion in the team."He is a generational talent and one of the best that the world has ever seen. If he is available for the Asia Cup and he plays the games that matter, he should be there," Chopra noted.PollShould Shubman Gill be included in the final squad for Asia Cup 2025?YesNoShubman Gill has played 21 T20Is so far, scoring 578 runs in 21 innings at an average of 30 and a strike rate of 139. His international record shows steady progress, but it was IPL 2025 where he found good rhythm. Turning out for Gujarat Titans, Gill scored 650 runs in 15 innings, giving his team consistent starts at the top. For India, however, the opening slots are currently held by Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson, who have partnered each other in the last 12 T20Is.

He emphasizes the importance of long-term planning for Bumrah's career. Gloster highlights Bumrah's support system and his positive return from injury. He suggests prioritizing Bumrah's longevity over immediate series appearances. Gloster believes Bumrah's management will benefit both the player and Indian cricket. India's Jasprit Bumrah celebrates with teammate Washington Sundar (PTI Photo/R Senthilkumar) Mumbai: At a time when there’s a raging debate amongst former cricketers and journalists around India’s ace pacer Jasprit Bumrah’s workload, following his appearance in just three out of five Tests in the recently held series in England to manage his workload, former Team India physio John Gloster has offered an interesting perspective. Replying to a question on whether Bumrah should be given leeway in choosing which games he would play in a series/tournament, Glosters said, “Look, I know that's a very controversial topic at the moment, and I'll happily tackle most controversial topics. I think that the athlete at the end of the day knows themselves better than anybody.”How Jasprit Bumrah is preparing for Lord's Test - batting, bowling and lot of jokes!Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Speaking at a book launch at the Cricket Club of India on Monday, Gloster said, “Most athletes these days who have good sports teams around them are taking advice from those people. But intuitively, most athletes know what's right and what's wrong. And he is a mature athlete. He’s a smart individual who knows exactly what he’s doing.” The 31-year-old Bumrah took 14 wickets in three Tests at 26.00 in the Tendulkar-Anderson Trophy, and was under fire for missing the crucial third and fifth Tests of the series due to workload management. Overall, Bumrah has taken 219 wickets in 48 Tests at 19.82, with 15 five-wicket hauls, and is set to feature in the Asia Cup, which Gloster felt “should not be a problem, since the tournament will be played in a T20 format and Bumrah has to bowl only four overs in a match.” Making a pertinent point about the need to manage Bumrah’s workload to ensure that he lasts for more years rather than just focusing on how he could play more and more matches in a series, which could put him at risk of burnout or injury, Gloster said, “And I think nine times out of ten, mature athletes who have good support are going to make the right decisions. And what we need to think about is not Bumrah for the next series or the series after that. We've got to think about Bumrah for the next two to three years.”PollHow important is workload management for professional athletes?Very importantSomewhat importantNot importantUnsure “In Jasprit's case, he had significant success when he came back. With the type of injury that he had, or has, he always knew that there were going to be times when it would need to be managed differently in order for him to continue to have success and stay playing at the highest level. And it is through good counsel that he comes to terms with that.” Gloster pointed out that it was crucial in Bumrah’s case that he received the right guidance in terms of his workload and injury management, which meant that a lot of times, there could be “others taking decisions for him,” in order for him to have a long and successful career in international cricket. “He knows that his career and the length of his career, his sporting longevity, is going to be through sound counsel and sound advice. This is what it's going to be like. And he knows that there are going to be situations where others are going to have to make decisions for him in order for him to have the best and longest career that he's going to have,” Gloster said.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill and current IPL Orange Cap holder Sai Sudharsan are also in contention.Srikkanth expressed uncertainty about Sanju Samson's inclusion in the squad and outlined his preferred opening combinations."Samson is doubtful, according to me," Srikkanth said. "My first-choice opener is Abhishek Sharma, no doubt. I will have two more openers. My picks would be Vaibhav Suryavanshi or Sai Sudharsan, with Shubman Gill as an option. If I were a selector, I would keep Vaibhav in the 15 for the T20 World Cup. He has been outstanding."PollShould Vaibhav Suryavanshi be included in India's squad for the Asia Cup T20?Yes, absolutely!No, he should wait."I think it should be Yashasvi Jaiswal, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, and Sai Sudharsan. I would take two out of these three. That would be my preference," he added.Since the T20 World Cup final in June 2024, Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson have been India's leading run-scorers in T20 internationals. Both players have received support from the team management, including head coach Gambhir and captain Suryakumar Yadav, for their aggressive batting style.Abhishek has accumulated 535 runs at an average of 33.43 with a strike rate of 193.84, including two centuries during this period. Samson has scored three hundreds in 17 matches at a strike rate of 171.47.However, Samson's recent performance in the five-match series against England has raised concerns. He struggled against short-pitched bowling and recorded three single-digit scores in five innings.Srikkanth, who previously captained a 16-year-old Sachin Tendulkar during his debut in Pakistan in 1989, believes India should not delay incorporating Vaibhav into the national setup as they prepare for next year's T20 World Cup.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

"If our physios are telling a player to manage workload, I think we should listen to them because they are the better judges."The comments were made at an event where Prasar Bharati, the country's public service broadcaster, signed a deal with London-based cricket analytics company.Sharma, who had a successful bowling partnership with Kapil Dev and claimed over 125 wickets in Tests and ODIs, expressed confidence in India's chances at the upcoming Asia Cup in the UAE."I know that whoever is selected will be the best for the country. And the kind of cricket we are playing right now, I'm really proud with the way India played in England," he added."And I'm very confident that we are definitely going to win the Asia Cup (to be played in T20 format) because soon after that we are playing the T20 World Cup (in 2026) in India."It's a very big thing when you are playing (the World Cup) in you own backyard. If the intent is right, the results will also be good."The event was attended by notable cricket personalities including Madan Lal from the 1983 World Cup-winning team, former India players Murali Kartik and Aakash Chopra, along with Prasar Bharati Chairman Navneet Kumar Sehgal.When asked about including Test captain Shubman Gill, who scored four centuries in the drawn England series, in the Asia Cup squad under Suryakumar Yadav's leadership, Sharma emphasised the need for selecting the best possible team. "Look, that is up to the selectors what they see. My opinion does not matter because I am no longer the chairman (of selectors), so I will only say that the best possible team should be selected," he stated."We have such good cricketers that not just the top-15 but even if the top-30 are selected, they are all very good.

NASA and ISRO will monitor this event. The asteroid is large, but poses no threat. Such flybys help scientists refine orbital models. They also help in planetary defense strategies. ISRO plans future missions to study near-Earth asteroids. International collaboration is key for planetary defense.  Asteroids have long fascinated scientists and the public alike, serving as reminders of both the beauty and unpredictability of our universe. These rocky remnants from the solar system’s formation often pass through Earth’s neighborhood, sometimes sparking excitement and curiosity when they come unusually close. While most of these flybys are harmless, they provide valuable opportunities for researchers to study asteroid behavior, refine orbital models, and improve planetary defense systems. NASA, along with other global space agencies, closely monitors such events to ensure Earth’s safety and to expand our understanding of near-Earth objects. One such asteroid making headlines now is 1997 QK1, a massive space rock expected to pass Earth on August 20, 2025, during a safe but significant flyby.NASA confirms asteroid 1997 QK1 will pass Earth on August 20: Size and distanceAsteroid 1997 QK1 was first detected in the late 1990s and has been tracked ever since. It belongs to the Aten group of near-Earth asteroids, named after the Egyptian sun god Aten. These asteroids are unique because their orbits cross Earth’s path around the Sun, making them frequent candidates for close encounters. This asteroid’s large size makes it particularly notable. To put its dimensions into perspective:It is longer than three football fields lined up. If it ever struck Earth, it could cause regional devastation, though not global extinction like the asteroid linked to the dinosaurs’ demise.Fortunately, its trajectory ensures it will remain safely distant during this flyby.On August 20, the asteroid will pass within 1.87 million miles (3 million kilometers) of Earth. While this may sound vast, in astronomical terms it qualifies as a close approach. For comparison:The Moon orbits Earth at about 238,855 miles (384,400 km).This asteroid will pass roughly eight times farther than the Moon’s distance.Though distant in human terms, space agencies classify such encounters as significant because they allow researchers to refine orbital predictions and study asteroid behavior more closely.Why Asteroid 1997 QK1 is not a threatAsteroids are classified as Potentially Hazardous Objects (PHOs) if they meet two conditions:They are larger than 140 meters (460 feet).They come within 4.6 million miles (7.4 million km) of Earth.Asteroid 1997 QK1 meets both criteria, but “potentially hazardous” does not mean “imminently dangerous.” Instead, it signals that its path deserves careful tracking. NASA’s precise calculations confirm that this flyby is safe, with no risk of impact now or in the near future.Why NASA and global space agencies track asteroidsAsteroid monitoring is a cornerstone of planetary defense. Even small changes in an asteroid’s orbit—caused by gravitational nudges from planets or effects like the Yarkovsky effect (when sunlight heats one side of an asteroid, slowly altering its trajectory)—can shift its long-term path.By observing asteroids like 1997 QK1, scientists aim to:Improve orbital models to predict future movements.Assess their composition, density, and spin rate.Explore strategies for deflection missions if a dangerous asteroid is discovered in the future.Notably, NASA’s DART mission (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) in 2022 demonstrated the possibility of altering an asteroid’s orbit by deliberately crashing a spacecraft into it—an important milestone in planetary defense.India’s ISRO plans future missions to study near-Earth asteroidsThe interest in asteroids is not limited to NASA. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has outlined plans for participation in global asteroid studies. According to ISRO Chairman S. Somanath, future missions may include research on larger near-Earth objects, especially as the world prepares for the highly anticipated close approach of asteroid Apophis in 2029.International collaborations involving NASA, ESA (European Space Agency), and JAXA (Japan) are essential, as planetary defense requires shared data and joint strategies. By pooling resources and expertise, space agencies ensure Earth is better prepared for cosmic encounters.Why asteroid 1997 QK1’s flyby is a scientific opportunity for NASA and ISROThe flyby of 1997 QK1 is more than a cosmic spectacle—it is a scientific opportunity. Studying such objects helps researchers uncover:Clues about the solar system’s formation, since asteroids are primitive building blocks of planets.Insights into their structural integrity, important for future resource mining or deflection missions.Better risk assessment models, ensuring preparedness for genuine threats.Although harmless, this event underscores the importance of constant vigilance. The universe is filled with millions of space rocks, and only careful monitoring can separate harmless visitors from those that could alter life on Earth.Also Read | NASA intern Thad Roberts stole $21 million in moon rocks from Johnson Space Center for love; shocked the worldAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Beyond survival and adaptation, the crew discovered an unexpected benefit in PS4 gaming. Video games helped maintain cognitive sharpness, reduce stress, and improve problem-solving skills.  In 2023, NASA conducted a groundbreaking experiment to simulate life on Mars, confining four volunteers in a habitat replica for over a year. The mission, known as CHAPEA (Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog), aimed to study how humans cope with extreme isolation, limited resources, and communication delays. While the scientific focus was on survival, adaptation, and psychological resilience, the crew discovered an unexpected ally: PS4 gaming. Beyond entertainment, video games helped the volunteers maintain cognitive sharpness, reduce stress, and improve problem-solving skills, offering insights for the future of long-duration space missions.How NASA simulates life on MarsThe CHAPEA mission recreated the harsh and confined conditions astronauts would face on a Mars journey. Volunteers lived in a 160-square-meter habitat at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston for 378 days. The experiment tested not only physical endurance, like managing food supplies and simulated spacewalks, but also the emotional and mental resilience of a crew cut off from the outside world. With Mars missions expected to last up to two years, understanding isolation’s impact on teamwork, decision-making, and morale is critical for preparing astronauts for interplanetary travel.Video games as a mental health tool During the mission, PS4 gaming became a central way for the crew to cope with monotony and stress. Strategy and simulation games like SimCity, Civilization, and Factorio challenged the participants to plan, manage resources, and solve complex problems, skills directly relevant to space travel. Microbiologist Anca Selariu noted that gaming sessions offered cognitive training while providing a mental escape, keeping the crew’s minds active and morale high. NASA researchers now see gaming as a potential standard tool for future long-duration missions. This experiment suggests that future astronauts could benefit from custom-designed video games tailored for space missions.Coping with isolation and psychological challenges The volunteers experienced strict isolation, with communication to NASA delayed by 22 minutes each way. Living without natural light in a small habitat tested their mental endurance. Video games played a vital role in maintaining mental health, helping reduce feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and stress. They also encouraged teamwork, strategic thinking, and problem-solving under pressure, essential skills for astronauts on real interplanetary missions. The CHAPEA mission demonstrates that structured entertainment can complement physical and psychological training for future explorers.Lessons for future Mars missions NASA’s Mars simulation experiment highlights the importance of addressing psychological needs during long-duration spaceflight. Incorporating video games and other interactive entertainment may improve astronauts’ cognitive function, morale, and overall mission success. By combining rigorous scientific research with practical coping strategies, missions like CHAPEA pave the way for safer, more effective human exploration of Mars and beyond. As NASA looks toward crewed missions to Mars in the 2030s, these findings could play a key role in shaping astronaut preparation.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

The New Glenn rocket will launch NASA's ESCAPADE probes in September 2025. This marks Blue Origin's first interplanetary flight. The mission will study Mars' magnetosphere and atmosphere. It will provide data on solar wind interaction. The launch highlights commercial space exploration.  Blue Origin, led by Jeff Bezos, is gearing up for a landmark mission to Mars, set to launch NASA’s ESCAPADE probes aboard the New Glenn rocket on September 29, 2025. This will mark Blue Origin’s first interplanetary flight and is notable because it precedes any Mars-bound mission from Elon Musk’s SpaceX, whose Starship is still undergoing development and orbital tests. The ESCAPADE mission, valued at $80 million, aims to study Mars’ magnetosphere and atmosphere, providing critical data on how solar wind interacts with the Red Planet. The launch represents a significant milestone in commercial space exploration and highlights the growing collaboration between private companies and government space agencies.ESCAPADE mission: Blue Origin and NASA’s groundbreaking Mars explorationBlue Origin, led by Jeff Bezos, will carry NASA’s twin ESCAPADE probes to Mars aboard the New Glenn rocket. The probes are designed to study Mars’ magnetosphere and space weather, analyzing how solar wind interacts with the Martian atmosphere and affects the planet’s climate and radiation environment. Managed by the University of California’s Space Sciences Laboratory, this mission will provide vital data for scientists studying Mars’ unique atmospheric and magnetic characteristics. Beyond its scientific goals, the mission represents a major collaboration between NASA and the commercial space sector, showing how private companies like Blue Origin can contribute to deep-space exploration while supporting critical planetary research initiatives.Blue Origin New Glenn’s role in interplanetary spaceflightThe upcoming launch is a milestone for Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket, which stands 188.5 feet tall and is designed for heavy-lift commercial and interplanetary missions. This mission will be the first time New Glenn is tasked with delivering payloads beyond Earth orbit, demonstrating the rocket’s precision, reliability, and long-range capabilities. Successfully transporting the ESCAPADE probes will solidify New Glenn’s role as a key player in commercial interplanetary travel and will provide valuable insights into the performance of large rockets under the unique stresses of a Mars-bound mission. This step will further position Blue Origin in the competitive landscape of space exploration.Reusable rocket technologyBlue Origin plans to recover New Glenn’s first stage booster, which measures 57.5 meters, using a drone ship stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. The recovery is a crucial step in Blue Origin’s mission to create fully reusable rockets, aiming to lower launch costs and reduce the environmental footprint of space missions. While the first test flight in early 2025 successfully delivered payloads to Earth orbit, the booster landing attempt was unsuccessful. This upcoming flight offers another chance to perfect booster recovery, a key technology for sustainable and cost-effective interplanetary missions. Mastering reusability is central to Blue Origin’s long-term vision for commercial spaceflight.Secondary payload: Advancing space communicationsIn addition to the ESCAPADE probes, New Glenn will carry a secondary payload from satellite communications company Viasat. This demonstration supports NASA’s Communications Services Project, aimed at improving satellite communication networks for both near-Earth and interplanetary operations. The payload will test advanced communication technologies that could enhance data transmission between spacecraft and Earth, supporting future missions to Mars, the Moon, and beyond. By integrating secondary payloads, Blue Origin can provide additional value to NASA and commercial partners, while advancing technologies that are essential for the next generation of space exploration. This mission underscores Blue Origin’s growing role as a frontrunner in humanity’s push toward Mars and deep space.Blue Origin and SpaceX in the Mars raceWhile Blue Origin’s New Glenn will launch NASA’s Mars probes before SpaceX sends any payload to the Red Planet, Elon Musk’s Starship continues to undergo testing and development for future Mars missions. This launch highlights the growing importance of commercial companies in planetary exploration and the role private firms play in advancing space technology. Both Blue Origin and SpaceX are pushing the boundaries of rocket design, reusability, and interplanetary capability, creating a new era of collaboration and competition in the quest to explore Mars and other distant worlds.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

He was greeted by ministers, ISRO chairman, and space enthusiasts. Shukla is scheduled to meet PM Modi and participate in National Space Day celebrations, with Parliament set to discuss his mission and India's space program. Astronaut Subhanshu Shukla, along with astronaut Prashant Balakrishnan Nair, receives grand welcome from Union space minister Jitendra Singh, Delhi CM Rekha Gupta and and Isro chairman V Narayanan at the Delhi airport NEW DELHI: Following his historic mission to the International Space Station (ISS), Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla received a red-carpet welcome at Delhi’s IGI airport as he returned to the country from the US in the early hours of Sunday. Shukla, who piloted the spacecraft to the space station as part of the Axiom-4 mission, was welcomed by Union space minister Jitendra Singh, Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta and Isro chairman V Narayanan, and a large crowd of space enthusiasts at the airport.Posting on X later, minister Jitendra Singh said, “A moment of pride for India! A moment of glory for #ISRO! A moment of gratitude to the dispensation that facilitated this under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. India’s Space glory touches the Indian soil… as the iconic son of Mother India, Gaganyatri Shubhanshu Shukla lands at Delhi in the early hours of morning today. Accompanying him, another equally accomplished Group Captain Prasanth Balakrishnan Nair, one of the astronauts selected for India’s first Human mission Gaganyaan who was India’s designated backup for the mission to the ISS. Privileged to receive both of them”.Shukla is expected to meet PM Modi and then travel to his hometown Lucknow. He is likely to return to the Capital on Aug 22–23 to participate in the National Space Day celebrations.PollShould the Indian government invest more in space exploration?DefinitelyNo, we need to focus on other issuesThe Lok Sabha will hold a special discussion on Monday on India's space journey and Shukla's historic mission aboard the ISS, according to a notice issued by the lower House. The House will discuss “India's first astronaut aboard the ISS — critical role of space programme for Viksit Bharat by 2047”, which could possibly end the deadlock between the govt and opposition in Parliament over the electoral roll revision in Bihar.Earlier on Saturday, Shukla had posted a smiling photograph of himself on a flight and said he was filled with emotions. “As I sit on the plane to come back to India, I have a mix of emotions running through my heart. I feel sad leaving a fantastic group of people behind who were my friends and family for the past one year during this mission. I am also excited about meeting all my friends, family, and everyone in the country for the first time post mission. I guess this is what life is -- everything all at once," he said.In the 79th Independence Day speech at the Red Fort on Friday, PM Modi, while mentioning Group Captain Shukla’s successful mission to ISS, had said that India is working towards becoming self-reliant in the space sector and preparing for the launch of Gaganyaan, its indigenous human space flight mission, and is also working on developing its own space station.In June, Shukla became the second Indian to go to space — after IAF wing commander Rakesh Sharma in 1984— as part of the Axiom-4 mission to the ISS. During the 18-day mission, Shukla, along with astronauts Peggy Whitson (US), Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski (Poland), and Tibor Kapu (Hungary), conducted more than 60 experiments and 20 outreach sessions aboard the ISS. He returned to the Earth on July 16.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous8 best anti-ageing ingredients you should start using in your 20sLifestyle10 best vegetarian sources of IronLifestyleSalwar tales by gorgeous lady Shabana ShajahantvCars under Rs 6 lakh with six airbags: Maruti Alto, Nissan Magnite and moreautoKundali Bhagya fame Shraddha Arya’s stunning ethnic lookstvAnupama Parameswaran shines bright in striking snapsEntertainment'Coolie' actress Reba Monica John’s picture-perfect momentsEntertainmentMalavika Mohanan's stunning style moments you can't missEntertainmentJannat Zubair’s Gen-Z Style is Pure PerfectiontvEver heard of Flying fish?

Orbiting 460 miles above Earth, it will capture high-resolution radar images, penetrating clouds and darkness. This breakthrough will provide critical data on climate change, natural hazards, and agricultural trends, offering global benefits through open data access.  In a landmark achievement for global space cooperation, NASA and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) have successfully deployed the world’s largest radar antenna in orbit. The 33-foot antenna, part of the joint NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission, is designed to capture Earth’s surface in unprecedented detail. Orbiting about 460 miles above the planet, the mission will provide high-resolution radar images that can penetrate clouds and operate both day and night. This breakthrough will empower scientists, policymakers, and disaster-response teams worldwide by offering critical data on climate change, natural hazards, and agricultural trends. The milestone marks a new era in Earth observation, combining advanced engineering with international collaboration.NASA, ISRO, and NISAR: Redefining Earth observationThe NISAR satellite, jointly managed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and ISRO, is equipped with dual-frequency L- and S-band synthetic aperture radar. This system allows it to track Earth’s surface changes with remarkable precision. Unlike optical satellites limited by weather or lighting conditions, NISAR provides continuous, reliable data, making it a game-changer for monitoring glaciers, forests, seismic activity, and farmlands. NASA emphasizes that this technology will revolutionize how nations prepare for disasters and manage resources.The 33-foot antenna, the largest ever used in a NASA Earth science mission, was built by Astro Aerospace, a Northrop Grumman company. Compact at launch, it expanded in orbit into its full umbrella-like shape. Engineers designed it to survive the extreme pressures of launch, the vacuum of space, and constant rotation at 4.5 revolutions per minute. This massive aperture is crucial for generating sharp radar images that will enable groundbreaking scientific studies.Synthetic aperture radar: Seeing the unseenSynthetic aperture radar (SAR) works like a powerful camera lens, simulating a larger antenna to produce high-resolution images. Using interferometric techniques, NISAR can compare radar images over time, creating 3D models of surface changes. These models can reveal subtle shifts such as slow land subsidence, early signs of landslides, or glacier retreat that would otherwise remain invisible. This makes SAR a vital tool for both climate research and urban planning.Global benefits of open dataNISAR’s open data policy ensures that its findings will be freely available to scientists, governments, and humanitarian organizations. From tracking crop cycles to forecasting geological hazards, its data will strengthen global food security and disaster preparedness. With the satellite set to revisit Earth every 12 days, decision-makers will gain access to a steady stream of actionable insights, helping build resilience against climate and environmental challenges. Beyond agriculture and disaster management, the mission will also aid in monitoring polar ice loss, deforestation, wetland health, and urban expansion. By providing this wealth of information, NISAR supports evidence-based policy decisions, empowering nations to respond effectively to environmental risks, mitigate climate change impacts, and create sustainable solutions for future generations.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Researchers successfully translated imagined words into text using brain implants and AI. The study, part of the BrainGate2 trial, demonstrated that brain signals for imagined speech are similar to those for attempted speech.  For decades, neuro-engineers have dreamed of helping people who have been cut off from the world of language. A disease like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, weakens the muscles in the airway. A stroke can kill neurons that normally relay commands for speaking. Perhaps, by implanting electrodes, scientists could record the brain's electric activity and translate that into spoken words.Now a team of researchers has made an important advance toward that goal. Previously they succeeded in decoding the signals produced when people tried to speak. In the new study, published Thursday in the journal Cell, their computer often made correct guesses when the subjects simply imagined saying words.Christian Herff, a neuroscientist at Maastricht University in the Netherlands who was not involved in the research, said the result went beyond the merely technological and shed light on the mystery of language. "It's a fantastic advance," Herff said. The new study is the latest result in a long-running clinical trial, called BrainGate2, that has already seen some remarkable successes.One participant, Casey Harrell, now uses his brain-machine interface to hold conversations. In 2023, after ALS had made his voice unintelligible, Harrell agreed to have electrodes implanted in his brain. A computer recorded the electrical activity from the implants as Harrell attempted to say different words. Over time, with the help of AI, the computer predicted 6,000 words, with 97.5% accuracy.But successes like this raised a troubling question: Could a computer accidentally record more than patients actually wanted to say?Could it eavesdrop on their inner voice? "We wanted to investigate if there was a risk of the system decoding words that weren't meant to be said aloud," said Erin Kunz, a neuroscientist at Stanford University and an author of the study. She and her colleagues also wondered if patients might actually prefer using inner speech.Kunz and her colleagues decided to investigate the mystery for themselves. The scientists gave participants seven different words, including "kite" and "day," then compared the brain signals when participants attempted to say the words and when they only imagined saying them.As it turned out, imagining a word produced a pattern of activity similar to that of trying to say it, but the signal was weaker. The computer did a good job of predicting which of the seven words the participants were thinking. For Harrell, it didn't do much better than a random guess would have, but for another participant it picked the right word more than 70% of the time.The researchers put the computer through more training, this time specifically on inner speech. Its performance improved significantly, including on Harrell. Now when the participants imagined saying entire sentences, such as "I don't know how long you've been here," the computer could accurately decode most of the words.Herff, who has done his own studies, was surprised that the experiment succeeded. Before, he would have said that inner speech is fundamentally different from the motor cortex signals that produce actual speech. "But in this study, they show that, for some people, it isn't that different," he said.Kunz emphasized that the computer's current performance involving inner speech would not be good enough to let people hold conversations. "The results are an initial proof of concept more than anything," she said. But she is optimistic that decoding inner speech could become the new standard for brain-computer interfaces. In recent trials, she and her colleagues have improved the computer's accuracy. "We haven't hit the ceiling yet," she said.

A chance find on an Australian beach has revealed a rare, entirely new species, Janjucetus dullardi, that could unlock new clues about whale evolution.The 25-million-year-old juvenile specimen, small enough to fit in a single bed, was identified in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. It had bulging, tennis-ball-sized eyes, a shark-like snout, and sharp teeth designed for hunting. “It was, let’s say, deceptively cute,” said Erich Fitzgerald, senior curator of vertebrate paleontology at Museums Victoria. “It might have looked like some weird mash-up between a whale, a seal and a Pokémon, but they were very much their own thing.”The partial skull, including ear bones and teeth, was found in 2019 along Victoria’s Jan Juc Beach, a site known for unusual whale fossils. Janjucetus dullardi is only the fourth species ever identified in the mammalodontid group, early whales that lived during the Oligocene Epoch, about 34–23 million years ago. These predators, around three metres long, were an early branch of the lineage that led to modern baleen whales, but looked radically different. “They may have had tiny little nubbins of legs just projecting as stumps,” Fitzgerald said, a mystery that will remain unless a more complete skeleton is found.The species name honours Ross Dullard, the amateur fossil hunter who spotted something black protruding from a cliff during a low-tide search. When he poked it, a tooth fell out. “I thought, geez, we’ve got something special here,” he said. Museums Victoria confirmed this week it was a new species. Dullard, a school principal, said the news was “the greatest 24 hours of my life,” describing rock-star treatment at work with “high fives coming left, right and centre.”This is the first mammalodontid found in Australia since 2006 and only the third in the country. Whale fossils of this quality are rare because most skeletons are lost to erosion, scavengers, and currents over millions of years. “It’s only the chosen few… that actually get preserved as fossils,” Fitzgerald noted.Researchers say Janjucetus dullardi could help reveal how early whales fed, moved, and adapted to ancient warm oceans, insights that could inform how modern marine life responds to climate change. Dullard plans to mark the occasion with a “fossil party” featuring cetacean-themed games and whale-shaped jello, to celebrate his nightmare Muppet find. “I’ve had sleepless nights,” he admitted. “I’ve dreamt about this whale.”About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Planetary warning! Something ‘big’ is moving inside Earth; here’s what scientists just found
A groundbreaking study by ETH Zurich reveals that solid rock in Earth's D" layer, located deep within the mantle, can move like a fluid while remaining solid. Researchers used diamond anvil cells and X-ray diffraction to observe mineral behavior under extreme conditions, explaining seismic wave anomalies and linking deep mantle processes to plate tectonics, volcanism, and Earth's magnetic field.

Researchers used diamond anvil cells and X-ray diffraction to observe mineral behavior under extreme conditions, explaining seismic wave anomalies and linking deep mantle processes to plate tectonics, volcanism, and Earth's magnetic field. Something ‘big’ is moving inside Earth; here’s what scientists just found For decades, scientists have sought to unravel the mysteries hidden deep beneath Earth’s surface. One of the most puzzling regions has been the D" layer, located about 2,700 kilometres (1,700 miles) beneath the surface, at the boundary between the planet’s lower mantle and outer core. This zone has long been known for its unusual seismic properties, which have sparked debates about its composition and behaviour.Now, a groundbreaking study conducted by researchers at ETH Zurich has revealed that solid rock in this deep layer of Earth’s mantle can move like a fluid, while still maintaining its solid state. Led by Professor Motohiko Murakami, the research team has provided experimental evidence explaining how minerals in the D" layer align and deform over geological timescales. The findings, published in Communications Earth & Environment, shed new light on mantle convection, plate tectonics, volcanic activity, and even the generation of Earth’s magnetic field.Earth’s hidden D" layer finally comes into focusThe D" layer sits just above the outer core and plays a key role in the planet’s internal dynamics. It has been a focal point for geoscientists because seismic waves passing through it behave differently than expected, often travelling faster in some regions and slower in others. Understanding the cause of these variations has been a challenge, as conditions in this layer involve extreme pressures and temperatures that are difficult to replicate in laboratory experiments.To study the D" layer, Murakami’s team used diamond anvil cells—devices capable of generating pressures exceeding those found deep within Earth—and X-ray diffraction techniques to examine the atomic structure of minerals under such conditions.The researchers recreated the high-pressure, high-temperature environment of the D" layer and observed how minerals behaved. They used magnesium germanate crystals as an experimental analogue for mantle minerals because they exhibit similar structural properties but are easier to work with in the lab.Role of post-perovskite in mantle dynamicsThe study focused on post-perovskite, a high-pressure phase of the mineral perovskite that forms under the extreme conditions of the D" layer. Post-perovskite has unique structural properties that allow its crystals to align in specific patterns when subjected to geological stress over long periods.This alignment enables solid-state flow, a process in which solid rock deforms and moves like a viscous fluid without melting. Such movement plays a critical role in mantle convection—the slow circulation of rock that drives the movement of tectonic plates at Earth’s surface.Explaining seismic wave anomaliesOne of the major outcomes of the research is the explanation for why seismic waves can accelerate by up to seven percent when passing through certain regions of the D" layer. The alignment of post-perovskite crystals changes the way seismic energy travels through the rock, matching patterns observed in global seismological data.This discovery effectively resolves a long-standing puzzle in geophysics and provides a clear link between deep mantle mineral behaviour and surface-level seismic measurements.Impact on plate tectonics and volcanismThe movement of solid rock in the D" layer has significant implications for plate tectonics. Mantle plumes—columns of hot rock rising from deep within the Earth—can be guided by the alignment of post-perovskite minerals, directing heat and material toward the upper mantle and crust.These processes are responsible for creating volcanic hotspots such as those in Hawaii and Iceland. The study also helps explain how deep mantle processes influence the formation of mountain ranges and the activity along subduction zones where one tectonic plate slides beneath another.Connection to Earth’s magnetic fieldBeyond plate tectonics, the findings have important implications for understanding the geodynamo—the mechanism that generates Earth’s magnetic field. The distribution of heat from the deep mantle to the outer core affects convection within the liquid iron core, which in turn influences magnetic field generation.By showing how the D" layer channels heat through solid-state flow, the study reveals a previously underappreciated link between deep mantle processes and the stability and variations of Earth’s magnetic field over the past 200 million years. This breakthrough opens new pathways for future research into how Earth’s deep interior continues to shape the planet’s surface and long-term habitability.Methodology and experimental insightsMurakami’s team achieved their results by:Using diamond anvil cells to create pressures of hundreds of gigapascals, similar to those at the core-mantle boundary.Applying high-temperature lasers to simulate the intense heat found deep underground.Analysing the crystal structures with synchrotron X-ray diffraction to observe how minerals deform under such conditions.Studying magnesium germanate as a stand-in for mantle perovskite allows the researchers to observe mineral alignment and flow properties.Significance for Earth scienceThe discovery that solid rock can behave like a fluid deep within the Earth provides:A more complete model of mantle convection and its effects on surface geology.An explanation for seismic anomalies detected in the D" layer.New insights into the heat flow between Earth’s core and mantle.A better understanding of how mantle plumes form and influence volcanism.A link between deep Earth processes and magnetic field generation.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

NASA captured 10 mysterious dark voids over remote island near Antarctica: What they reveal about the bizarre natural phenomena
In May 2016, NASA satellites detected ten unusual dark voids within cloud cover above Heard Island, a remote volcanic landmass. These formations, linked to von Kármán vortices, exhibited an atypical darkness, tight spiral structure, and a sharp directional change. This rare event provides scientists with a unique opportunity to study small-island wind effects and their impact on atmospheric patterns.

These formations, linked to von Kármán vortices, exhibited an atypical darkness, tight spiral structure, and a sharp directional change. This rare event provides scientists with a unique opportunity to study small-island wind effects and their impact on atmospheric patterns.  NASA satellites have captured a rare and eerie sight: 10 swirling “dark voids” puncturing thick cloud cover above Heard Island, an isolated volcanic landmass in the southern Indian Ocean, around 900 miles (1,500 km) north of Antarctica. The black patches, each averaging 8 miles (13 km) wide, formed in May 2016 and appear as part of an unusual atmospheric pattern. While these formations are linked to von Karman vortices, swirling air currents formed when wind passes around a tall obstacle, scientists note their unusual darkness, tight spiral structure, and dramatic change in direction make this event exceptional.The 10 dark voids show isolation’s impact on rare weatherThe 10 massive dark voids, captured in May 2016, are a striking example of how Heard Island’s extreme environment fuels rare atmospheric phenomena. This uninhabited Australian territory lies in one of the most remote and storm-battered regions on Earth, within the “Furious Fifties,” where powerful westerly winds dominate. Towering above the island is Mawson Peak, a 9,000-foot (2,700-meter) active volcano that disrupts airflow and cloud formations. The combination of volcanic terrain, fierce winds, and the island’s isolation provides perfect conditions for unusual cloud patterns, but seeing them so distinctly in satellite imagery is extraordinarily rare.Von Karman vortices: Nature’s swirling wind patternsVon Karman vortices form when fast-moving winds encounter an obstacle, such as an island or mountain, disrupting airflow and creating alternating spinning eddies on either side. These patterns are named after physicist Theodore von Karman, who first described the phenomenon. While von Karman vortices are occasionally observed in other regions of the world, such as the Canary Islands or Guadalupe Island, they usually appear as long, wispy trails of clouds. The vortices over Heard Island were instead marked by dense, perfectly circular gaps in the clouds, making this event stand out from typical occurrences.Unusual shape and sharp bend make it uniqueMost von Karman vortex streams appear smooth and aligned, flowing in a consistent direction. In contrast, the May 2016 formation over Heard Island bent sharply by nearly 90 degrees midstream, an abrupt shift likely triggered by intense westerly winds exceeding 50 mph (80 km/h). Additionally, the presence of thick clouds meant that only the vortex cores were visible, creating the illusion of black voids in the sky. This combination of strong winds, sudden directional change, and isolated visibility of the vortex centers is rarely seen in satellite imagery. Such extraordinary formations provide scientists with valuable insights into extreme weather behavior in isolated regions.A rare chance to study small-island wind effectsBecause Mawson Peak is smaller than most peaks that generate von Karman vortices, such patterns in this location are uncommon. This event offered researchers a rare opportunity to analyze how atmospheric flows interact with smaller volcanic landmasses. Studying these effects can improve understanding of how wind patterns influence global weather systems, climate, and even the transport of airborne particles across oceans. The Heard Island vortices also highlight how relatively minor topographic features can cause significant disturbances in large-scale airflow under the right conditions.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

The feat comes just weeks after Shubhanshu Shukla became the first Indian to reach the International Space Station.Historic Moment: Shubhanshu Shukla Touches Down Earth With Spashdown Off U.S. Coast | Axiom-4The expedition was carried out in collaboration with France and involved two Indian aquanauts who completed separate deep dives in the French submersible Nautile earlier this month.PollWhich achievement do you think is more significant for India's scientific progress?Diving over 5,000 metres in the oceanReaching the International Space StationOn 5 August, Raju Ramesh, a scientist at the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), descended 4,025 metres. A record-setting 5,002-metre dive by retired Navy Commander Jatinder Pal Singh the next day followed this.Union Earth Sciences Minister Jitendra Singh said, "We have an Indian going into space and an Indian going into the deep ocean almost simultaneously." He called it part of India’s “double conquest” in underexplored frontiers, which he believes will contribute to the country’s economic growth.The minister added that PM Narendra Modi has shown a strong interest in the Deep Ocean Mission and blue economy.The Deep Ocean Mission, cleared by the Union Cabinet in 2021, covers crewed and uncrewed submersibles, deep-sea mining technology, biodiversity research and ocean-based energy projects. It aims to explore and utilise resources within India’s Exclusive Economic Zone and continental shelf.Matsya 6000M Ravichandran, Secretary in the ministry of Earth sciences, said the Deep Ocean Mission was carried out to gain firsthand experience before India tries the same with its own submersible, Matsya 6000. "One of the verticals of the DOM aims to develop technology to harness non-living ocean resources and a submersible which can carry humans to the deepest parts of the ocean for exploration," he said.The Matsya 6000, likely to be ready by December 2027, will carry three people to depths of 6,000 metres inside a titanium alloy sphere. It will have scientific instruments, communication systems and safety features with emergency endurance of up to 96 hours.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

He was aided by Tiffany Fowler and Shae Saur. The stolen rocks were valued at $21 million. Roberts claimed it was for love, but the FBI found he planned to sell them. Roberts and his accomplices were arrested. The heist damaged scientific research. Source: LADbible In one of the most audacious and bizarre crimes in NASA history, Thad Roberts, a 24-year-old intern, stole moon rocks valued at $21 million in 2002, driven by romance rather than greed. Alongside his girlfriend Tiffany Fowler and fellow intern Shae Saur, Roberts executed a meticulously planned burglary at Houston’s Johnson Space Center, using authentic NASA badges, rewired security cameras, and Neoprene suits to bypass alarms. Their theft of 17 pounds of lunar samples included historic moon rocks from Apollo missions 1969–1972. While Roberts claimed the act was “for love,” the FBI revealed he had attempted to sell the rocks secretly online. This extraordinary heist destroyed priceless scientific research, embarrassed NASA, and shocked the world, blending science, crime, and obsession in an unforgettable story.$21 million moon rock theft at Johnson Space Center shocks scientists worldwideOn a July night in 2002, Roberts, Fowler, and Saur infiltrated Building 31 at Johnson Space Center. Roberts and Fowler donned Neoprene bodysuits, which allowed them to bypass thermal alarms, while Saur acted as a lookout. Using a power saw, they cracked open a 601-pound safe containing moon rocks and meteorites, including samples from every Apollo mission, many of which were irreplaceable and scientifically invaluable. The stolen lunar samples were worth approximately $21 million and represented decades of scientific research, experimentation, and NASA missions. The planning and execution demonstrated not only audacity but also technical sophistication, showing how a combination of insider knowledge, meticulous preparation, and determination can circumvent the most secure facilities. Source: Live ScienceWho is Thad Roberts? From NASA Intern to mastermind behind the $21 million moon rock theftThad Roberts graduated from the University of Utah with a triple degree in physics, geology, and geophysics, making him highly qualified to work at NASA. He met Tiffany Fowler, a 22-year-old stem cell researcher, and the couple quickly became romantically involved. Roberts reportedly told Fowler he wanted to “give her the moon,” framing the theft as a grand romantic gesture. According to People.com , the FBI considered financial motives, Roberts maintained that the act symbolized devotion rather than profit.Moon rock theft ends with FBI arrests and millions in NASA lunar samples lostRoberts and Fowler’s motivation went beyond romance—they symbolically “had sex on the moon” by placing stolen lunar samples under a blanket during intimate moments. Roberts later stated, “No one had ever had sex on the moon before,” underscoring the bizarre, almost surreal nature of the crime. While Roberts claimed love was the driving factor, the FBI discovered he had negotiated with a Belgian buyer willing to pay up to $5,000 per gram, proving the theft had financial implications.The heist came to a dramatic end when Roberts and Fowler traveled to Orlando to meet the potential buyer, only to be apprehended by undercover FBI agents. Saur and Gordon McWhorter, who helped arrange the sale, were arrested shortly afterward. The investigation revealed that the theft had caused irreversible damage: the moon rocks were now “virtually useless to the scientific community,” and three decades of NASA research notes were destroyed as reported.Moon rock theft from NASA leads to jail, house arrest, and finesThad Roberts pleaded guilty to the theft of moon rocks and other NASA artifacts, serving over six years of an eight-year prison sentence before his release in 2008. Tiffany Fowler and Shae Saur received house arrest, community service, and were required to pay restitution to NASA. Gordon McWhorter was convicted at trial for his involvement in the theft and sentenced to six years in prison. The case highlighted serious security breaches and led to stricter controls on NASA’s valuable collections.Also Read | NASA and Google collaborating together to boost astronaut health on Moon and Mars missionsAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Bermuda Triangle ‘mystery’ solved? Scientist explains the real cause behind vanishings of ships and planes
The Bermuda Triangle's infamous reputation for unexplained disappearances is largely unfounded, according to scientist Karl Kruszelnicki and supported by NOAA and Lloyd's of London. The region's high traffic volume, combined with challenging environmental conditions like the Gulf Stream and frequent storms, accounts for the incidents. Human error and equipment failure also play significant roles, debunking myths of supernatural forces.

The region's high traffic volume, combined with challenging environmental conditions like the Gulf Stream and frequent storms, accounts for the incidents. Human error and equipment failure also play significant roles, debunking myths of supernatural forces. Image: Getty Images  For decades, the Bermuda Triangle, the stretch of ocean roughly bounded by Miami, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico, has been the subject of mystery, fear, and speculation. From tales of ships vanishing without a trace to aircraft disappearing mid-flight, the region has inspired theories about supernatural forces, alien abductions, and even time warps. But according to Australian scientist Karl Kruszelnicki, backed by research from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Lloyd’s of London, these myths do not hold up. Far from being a cursed zone, the Bermuda Triangle’s so-called mysteries can be explained by natural environmental conditions, human error, and statistical probability. The truth, Kruszelnicki emphasizes, is far less otherworldly and far more rooted in the realities of nature and navigation.Bermuda Triangle poses no greater risk than other oceansKruszelnicki, supported by NOAA and Lloyd’s of London, has long maintained that the Bermuda Triangle is no more dangerous than any other ocean region. Disappearances occur at roughly the same proportional rate as elsewhere in the world’s waters. As noted by Kruszelnicki, the higher number of incidents is largely due to the Triangle being one of the busiest shipping and flight corridors in the world, where heavy traffic naturally means more recorded accidents. Statistical data confirms that when the volume of vessels and aircraft is taken into account, the accident rate is completely ordinary. This directly challenges the very foundation of the Triangle’s mythical reputation.Environmental and navigational challenges of 'Bermuda Triangle'According to Kruszelnicki, the geography and weather patterns of the Bermuda Triangle create conditions that can challenge even experienced navigators. The Gulf Stream, a powerful ocean current, can cause sudden changes in weather, generate violent storms, and push vessels off course within minutes. The region is also prone to tropical storms, hurricanes, waterspouts, and rogue waves that can overwhelm ships and planes without warning. Numerous islands and coral reefs make for hazardous, shallow navigation routes, increasing the risk of grounding or collision. Kruszelnicki also points out that certain areas experience magnetic anomalies where compasses may point to true north instead of magnetic north, leading to potential navigation errors. Furthermore, unpredictable microbursts and rapidly forming squalls can make navigation extremely hazardous, even for experienced crews. Sudden changes in visibility and wind patterns have historically contributed to numerous near-miss incidents in the area. When all these factors combine, even a minor miscalculation can turn deadly.Human error and equipment failureAs Kruszelnicki explains, a significant number of accidents in the Bermuda Triangle can be traced to pilot or captain mistakes, faulty equipment, or outdated forecasting methods. These human and technical shortcomings often occur alongside the already challenging weather and navigational conditions of the region. In earlier decades, limited communication systems and slower emergency response times meant that vessels or aircraft in trouble had little chance of rescue. Even today, with advanced technology, mistakes and malfunctions can quickly escalate into disasters when compounded by sudden storms or rough seas. Kruszelnicki stresses that the human factor is often underestimated in popular explanations of the Triangle’s incidents.Origins of the myth of the Bermuda Triangle The term “Bermuda Triangle” was first coined in 1963 by writer Vincent Gaddis, who linked the region to a series of unexplained disappearances. His writings sparked public curiosity, but the myth gained massive momentum in 1974 when author Charles Berlitz published a bestselling book that embellished these stories with speculation about Atlantis, alien abductions, and other sensational claims. Kruszelnicki has often criticized such accounts for their lack of credible evidence and reliance on anecdotal storytelling. The entertainment value of the myth overshadowed scientific explanations, cementing its place in pop culture for generations despite the absence of verifiable proof.Famous anecdote – the Bruce Gernon storyIn 1970, pilot Bruce Gernon reported encountering a strange tunnel-like cloud while flying through the Bermuda Triangle. He claimed his instruments malfunctioned, and upon exiting the cloud, he experienced a time discrepancy of about 30 minutes. The story has been widely discussed in books, documentaries, and paranormal circles, with some suggesting it could be evidence of a time warp. Kruszelnicki, however, remains skeptical, noting that the account is anecdotal and lacks corroborating evidence. Many experts, including Kruszelnicki, believe it could be explained by meteorological phenomena such as unusual cloud formations or optical illusions.Scientific consensus over Bermuda TriangleThe conclusion from NOAA, the US Navy, and Lloyd’s of London — all echoed by Kruszelnicki — is clear: the Bermuda Triangle is not more hazardous than any other heavily traveled ocean region. The so-called mystery is a product of natural hazards, geographic challenges, human mistakes, and decades of exaggerated storytelling. Statistically, the accident rates are consistent with those in other busy maritime and aviation areas. While the legend of the Bermuda Triangle may continue to inspire curiosity and creativity, the evidence, as Kruszelnicki emphasizes, points to a reality grounded in science, not the supernatural. Ultimately, the Bermuda Triangle’s greatest power lies not in sinking ships, but in captivating imaginations. It is a reminder that mystery often thrives where facts are overlooked, and that reality can be just as fascinating as myth.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

This ancient water, isolated for millennia, provides unprecedented insights into Earth's early conditions and potential for life in extreme environments. Professor Barbara Sherwood Lollar's team's findings challenge existing assumptions and open new avenues for astrobiological research.  In 2016, scientists discovered the oldest water on Earth deep within a Canadian mine, estimated to be over 2 billion years old. This rare water had been trapped underground, isolated from surface influences, offering unique insights into Earth’s ancient geological past and extreme environments. Professor Barbara Sherwood Lollar and her team made this remarkable discovery in the Kidd Creek Mine in Ontario, Canada. The water's extraordinary age and composition have important implications for understanding subterranean ecosystems and the possibility of life in harsh conditions, including on other planets.This finding marks a groundbreaking moment in geology and astrobiology, revealing how Earth’s deepest waters can hold secrets from billions of years ago.Discovery of the oldest water on Earth in Kidd Creek MineThe oldest water on Earth was uncovered at a depth of about 3 kilometers in the Kidd Creek Mine, Ontario. This water had remained sealed away for roughly 1.5 to 2.6 billion years, surpassing previous finds of ancient water worldwide. The research team, led by geologist Barbara Sherwood Lollar, tested the water’s age using isotopic analysis, confirming its unprecedented age. The longevity and isolation of this water make it a living snapshot of early Earth conditions, preserved untouched for billions of years.This groundbreaking discovery and detailed scientific analysis were published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications in 2014, offering a comprehensive look at the water’s age, chemistry, and significance. The findings challenge previous assumptions about Earth’s hydrological cycles and open new questions about the movement and preservation of water in the planet’s deep crust.Scientific importance of the oldest water on earth discoveryFinding the oldest water on Earth has major scientific significance. It offers clues about how microbial life could survive in isolated environments for billions of years, far from sunlight. This challenges previous assumptions about life’s limits on Earth and extends hope for discovering life in similar extraterrestrial environments, such as Mars or icy moons like Europa. The high salinity and unique chemical composition of this ancient water also provide insight into geological processes that occurred billions of years ago. These findings expand our understanding of Earth’s deep biosphere and the resilience of life. Moreover, studying such ancient water helps scientists understand how life might adapt to extreme conditions, pushing the boundaries of astrobiology and earth sciences.Tasting the oldest water on earth: A geologist’s unique experienceIn a remarkable gesture, Professor Sherwood Lollar tasted the oldest water on Earth herself. She described the water as “very salty and bitter,” much saltier than seawater. Geologists sometimes taste groundwater to gauge mineral content, and this personal experience highlighted the unique chemical environment preserved in the water. The high salinity reflects mineral concentration accumulated over billions of years underground.This firsthand encounter added a human dimension to the groundbreaking scientific discovery and underscored the curiosity and dedication behind such research. It also gave the public a tangible connection to this ancient, isolated water source, sparking greater interest in geology and Earth’s hidden history.Unlocking Earth’s ancient secrets through the oldest waterThe discovery of the oldest water on Earth deep within Canada’s Kidd Creek Mine offers an extraordinary window into our planet’s distant past. Trapped for billions of years, this ancient water not only enriches our understanding of Earth’s geological history but also fuels exciting possibilities about life in extreme environments beyond our planet.

Woman astronomer paid 30 cents an hour: unlocked cosmic distances; still missed out on Nobel Prize
Henrietta Swan Leavitt worked as a Harvard “computer” earning just 30 cents an hour, yet her groundbreaking discovery of the period-luminosity relationship transformed astronomy. Her work enabled scientists to measure cosmic distances and understand the expanding universe. Despite this monumental contribution, Leavitt never received a Nobel Prize during her lifetime, highlighting the challenges faced by women in science.

Her work enabled scientists to measure cosmic distances and understand the expanding universe. Despite this monumental contribution, Leavitt never received a Nobel Prize during her lifetime, highlighting the challenges faced by women in science.  Henrietta Swan Leavitt, an American astronomer whose groundbreaking discovery revolutionized how we measure the cosmos. Born in 1868, Leavitt began working at the Harvard College Observatory at a time when women were excluded from operating telescopes and instead employed as “computers” to analyze astronomical data. Despite earning just 30 cents an hour, her dedication and meticulous research led to one of the most important astronomical breakthroughs of the 20th century.In 1908, Leavitt discovered the period-luminosity relationship of Cepheid variable stars, showing a direct link between their brightness and pulsation period. This discovery became the key to measuring vast cosmic distances and ultimately helped astronomers like Edwin Hubble prove that the universe is expanding. Yet, despite her monumental contributions, Leavitt was never awarded a Nobel Prize during her lifetime.The discovery that changed astronomy foreverLeavitt’s key insight came from studying Cepheid variable stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, a galaxy assumed to be at a uniform distance from Earth. By carefully analyzing photographic plates, she found that the brightness of these stars varied in a predictable way tied to their pulsation period: the longer the period, the brighter the star. This relationship, now known as Leavitt’s Law, gave astronomers a powerful “standard candle,” an object of known brightness that can be used to calculate distances in space.Using this standard candle method, astronomers could measure how far away these stars and by extension, the galaxies they reside in actually were. This was a breakthrough in cosmic distance measurement, allowing scientists to determine the scale of the universe with unprecedented accuracy. Leavitt’s discovery became the foundation for Edwin Hubble’s later work in the 1920s where he used Cepheid variables to prove that the Milky Way was just one of many galaxies and that the universe itself was expanding.Overcoming barriers as a woman in scienceHenrietta Swan Leavitt’s career unfolded during a time when women faced serious discrimination in science. Women were largely relegated to supportive roles and denied opportunities such as telescope operation and academic recognition. Leavitt was paid a modest wage of about 30 cents an hour as a “computer” at Harvard, tasked with analyzing star data rather than conducting independent research.Despite these limitations, she showed extraordinary focus and persistence. Leavitt’s progressive hearing loss later in life made her work even more challenging, yet she continued her observations and calculations until her untimely death at the age of 53. Tragically, although her work was foundational for modern astronomy, she never received the Nobel Prize or equivalent accolades during her lifetime, and a posthumous nomination was not permitted.Legacy and lasting impact on cosmologyLeavitt’s period-luminosity relationship remains one of the cornerstones of astrophysics. It revolutionized the way distances to faraway celestial objects are measured, enabling astronomers to map the universe on a grand scale. This method underpins modern cosmology, helping scientists determine not only distances but also the rate at which the universe is expanding, key to the Big Bang theory.Edwin Hubble famously used Leavitt’s discovery to measure the distances to galaxies beyond the Milky Way and uncover the expanding nature of the universe, a milestone that forever changed humanity’s understanding of our place in the cosmos. Today, Henrietta Swan Leavitt is celebrated as a pioneering figure in astronomy whose brilliance and perseverance overcame societal and physical obstacles, leaving a profound legacy that continues to guide scientific exploration.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

The CalBots are made from safe materials.  BENGALURU: For millions of people, the sudden, sharp pain of tooth sensitivity can turn a sip of cold water into a jolt. Now, researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), in collaboration with Bengaluru-based deep-tech startup Theranautilus, have engineered “CalBots” – magnetic nanobots that can seal the problem at its source.As per IISc, CalBots are 400-nanometre particles loaded with a calcium silicate-based bioceramic formula, designed to travel deep inside dentinal tubules, the tiny tunnels in the tooth that lead to nerve endings. Guided by an external magnetic field, the bots can penetrate up to 500 micrometres into the tubules and self-assemble into stable, cement-like plugs that recreate the tooth’s natural barrier. One application, the team says, can offer lasting relief.Dental hypersensitivity affects nearly one in four people worldwide and occurs when enamel erosion or gum recession exposes the dentine layer beneath, IISc said. The tubules in dentine act as direct pathways to the nerves, which is why even mild temperature changes can trigger pain. “We didn’t want to create a slightly better version of what’s already out there. We wanted a technology that solves a real problem in a way that no one’s attempted before,” Shanmukh Peddi, postdoctoral researcher at IISc’s Centre for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE) and co-founder of Theranautilus. The team used a completely new class of bioceramic cement for the nanobots. While bioceramics are common in orthopaedics and dentistry, the formulation was designed specifically for hypersensitivity – to travel deeper and last longer.To test the approach, they worked first on extracted human teeth. “On these samples, we applied CalBots under a magnetic field for 20 minutes, during which the bots sealed the dentinal tubules by forming deep, stable plugs – a result confirmed through high-resolution imaging,” Peddi said.They then moved to animal trials, inducing sensitivity in mice and tracking their drinking behaviour. “Healthy mice drank both cold and room temperature water equally. But sensitive mice completely avoided cold water. After treatment, they started drinking it again. We saw 100% behavioural recovery. That was a big moment for us,” he said.The CalBots are made entirely from materials classified as ‘Generally Recognised as Safe’ and passed toxicity tests in mice. “This is a compelling demonstration of what nanorobotics can achieve, and how they could significantly impact future healthcare,” said Ambarish Ghosh, professor at CeNSE and one of the study’s corresponding authors.Debayan Dasgupta, former PhD student at CeNSE and co-founder of Theranautilus, sees this as part of a bigger technological shift. “We’ve created a regenerative, active nanomaterial – a step towards the kind of ‘tiny mechanical surgeons’ Richard Feynman once envisioned,” he said.Peddi added: “This is something we’ve worked towards silently for years. And the fact that we’ve done it here, in India, makes us very happy.”About the AuthorChethan KumarChethan Kumar is a Senior Assistant Editor with the Times of India.

Though smaller than initially thought, it remains the largest interstellar visitor known. Confirmed as a comet with a glowing tail, 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be twice as old as our solar system, offering a glimpse into the early universe.  NASA has revealed exciting new information about a mysterious interstellar object called 3I/ATLAS, speeding through our solar system at extraordinary velocities. First detected on July 1, this visitor from beyond our star system has fascinated scientists globally with its astonishing speed of 130,000 miles per hour and intriguing characteristics. Recent observations from the Hubble Space Telescope have captured the clearest images to date, offering key insights into its size, makeup, and path. These discoveries represent a significant advancement in our understanding of these rare travelers crossing the galaxy into our cosmic neighborhood, deepening knowledge about interstellar dynamics, cosmic evolution, and planetary defense strategies.NASA confirms 3I/ATLAS as the fastest interstellar object ever detectedNASA’s Hubble Space Telescope observations have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is travelling through our solar system at an extraordinary speed of 130,000 miles per hour (209,000 km/h), making it the fastest interstellar object ever recorded. This speed far exceeds that of previous interstellar visitors such as ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. Scientists explain that the object’s velocity is the result of billions of years of gravitational interactions, known as the “gravitational slingshot effect,” where passing stars, planets, and nebulae impart additional momentum to the comet. This extreme speed means the object is only briefly visible as it races through, providing a fleeting window of opportunity for study. NASA’s continuous monitoring aims to capture as much data as possible during its swift passage.Image: Daily MailSize estimates refined: NASA reveals 3I/ATLAS is smaller but still immenseInitial observations by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory suggested that 3I/ATLAS’s icy core might be around seven miles (11.2 km) wide. However, NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has now refined these estimates, revealing that the core is smaller — at most 3.5 miles (5.6 km) across, and possibly as little as 1,000 feet (320 meters) in diameter. Despite being smaller than first believed, this still makes 3I/ATLAS the largest interstellar object ever discovered, dwarfing the next largest known visitor by up to 14 times. The high-resolution images also highlight the comet’s glowing gas halo, which had made it appear larger in earlier, less detailed observations. Understanding the true size helps scientists model its composition, structural integrity, and behavior more accurately as it interacts with powerful solar radiation and cosmic forces.NASA confirms 3I/ATLAS’s cometary nature and its spectacular glowing tailThanks to NASA’s powerful telescopes, scientists have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is not a solid rock but a comet — a chunk of ice, frozen gases, and dust surrounded by a halo of evaporating material. The Hubble images reveal a dust plume streaming from the side of the comet heated by the Sun, along with a faint tail trailing behind it. This tail is formed as the comet’s surface warms up, causing ice to vaporize and release gas and dust into space, creating the characteristic glowing appearance. This phenomenon is similar to that seen in comets within our solar system, but 3I/ATLAS’s interstellar origin and extreme speed make it a rare and valuable subject for study. NASA expects the tail and dust plume to become more pronounced as the object approaches its closest point to the Sun. Scientists hope continued observation will shed light on the comet’s chemical composition, helping reveal clues about its interstellar origins. 3I/ATLAS offers humanity a fleeting glimpse into the mysteries of other star systems, carrying secrets older than our Sun itself.Ancient traveler: NASA estimates 3I/ATLAS is twice as old as our solar systemOne of the most astonishing revelations from NASA’s studies is the estimated age of 3I/ATLAS. Scientific analysis suggests this object has been orbiting the Milky Way for at least eight billion years — roughly twice the age of our own 4.6 billion-year-old solar system. This implies 3I/ATLAS formed long before our Sun and planets came into existence, making it a true cosmic relic. Its journey through the galaxy has likely included multiple gravitational encounters with stars and interstellar clouds, which may have shaped its trajectory and speed. Studying such an ancient object offers scientists a unique glimpse into the conditions and materials present in the early universe and helps refine models of galactic evolution. Its fleeting passage is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to study a messenger from the galaxy’s distant past. NASA researchers emphasize that each discovery from 3I/ATLAS brings us closer to understanding how planetary systems form and evolve across the galaxy.Safe passage confirmed by NASA: No threat to EarthDespite its immense speed and close approach to the Sun, NASA has assured the public that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth. The comet will reach its closest point to the Sun in late October, passing just inside the orbit of Mars at about 130 million miles (210 million kilometers). Crucially, it will be on the opposite side of the Sun relative to Earth during this time, ensuring no risk of collision or gravitational disturbance. NASA continues to monitor the comet’s trajectory precisely, as the interaction with the Sun’s heat may slightly alter its path. After passing the Sun, 3I/ATLAS will head back out into interstellar space, continuing its long journey through the galaxy. This may be humanity’s only chance to witness this ancient traveler before it disappears forever into the cosmic void. Its fleeting visit serves as a reminder of the vast, mysterious, and ever-changing nature of our universe.A new era of discovery: NASA leads the charge in interstellar object research3I/ATLAS marks only the third confirmed interstellar object ever detected, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. NASA’s advancements in telescope technology, sky surveys, and space observatories like Hubble have ushered in a new era of interstellar discovery. Researchers expect that as survey instruments become more sensitive and comprehensive, the frequency of detecting such visitors will increase. NASA plans to utilize not only Hubble but also the James Webb Space Telescope, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory to study 3I/ATLAS in multiple wavelengths. This will allow scientists to capture unprecedented data on the object's composition and interaction with the solar environment. These coordinated observations are crucial for building a more complete picture of interstellar objects and their origins. This coordinated effort will deepen our understanding of the composition, origin, and behavior of interstellar objects and their role in the cosmic ecosystem.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

A new study published in Global and Planetary Change reveals that these ancient structures were formed when early Atlantic waters carved through the Earth’s crust, much earlier than previously believed. This groundbreaking discovery reshapes our understanding of Atlantic Ocean formation, offers fresh perspectives on Cretaceous climate shifts, and provides crucial clues to tectonic movements that governed our planet’s evolving geography. From deep-sea sediment patterns to global carbon cycles and ocean circulation, these mud waves, once hidden, now tell a story with far-reaching implications for modern geology and climate science.Underwater mud waves push the Atlantic's birth date back to 117 million years agoRecent research published in Global and Planetary Change (2025) by Duarte, Nicholson, and colleagues has shed new light on the early history of the Atlantic Ocean. Using a combination of modern seismic imaging and archived drilling data from 1975, the team identified a series of massive 117-million-year-old mud waves buried deep beneath the Atlantic seafloor. These geological giants, stretching over a kilometer in length and rising hundreds of meters high, were formed when dense, salty water from the young North Atlantic spilled into the deeper southern basins, creating powerful underwater currents. The composition and layering of these mud waves reveal that such flows occurred far earlier than previously believed, suggesting that the Equatorial Atlantic Gateway, the oceanic passage linking the northern and southern Atlantic opened sooner than most geological models predicted. This pushes back the estimated timeline of when the Atlantic became a fully connected ocean, making the discovery a crucial piece in reconstructing Earth’s plate tectonic and oceanographic history. Not only does this finding refine our understanding of how and when the Atlantic took shape, but it also offers insights into the role of deep-water currents in shaping the seafloor over millions of years.Sediment patterns illuminate early ocean currents and climate changeThe formation of these 117-million-year-old mud waves was far more than an isolated ocean-floor event, it represented a profound turning point in Earth’s climate and geological history. When the young North Atlantic’s saline waters finally breached into the long-isolated southern basins, they encountered dense, carbon-rich deep waters that had been locked away for millions of years. This sudden mixing unleashed colossal underwater mud avalanches, cascading across the seabed with immense force and reshaping the ocean floor’s topography on a scale rarely seen in Earth’s past.The consequences reached far beyond the geology. This tectonic–oceanic upheaval likely interrupted one of the planet’s most important climate-regulating processes: the long-term burial of carbon in marine sediments. By disturbing these ancient, carbon-heavy layers, the event may have kept vast amounts of greenhouse gases circulating in the atmosphere, helping sustain the elevated global temperatures characteristic of the mid-Cretaceous, a period often referred to as one of Earth’s “greenhouse worlds.” Such persistent warmth not only influenced ocean chemistry and circulation but also shaped the evolution and distribution of marine life for millions of years afterward.Understanding precisely when the Equatorial Atlantic Gateway opened is therefore critical. It marks the moment the Atlantic transitioned from a series of isolated basins into a fully connected ocean, altering heat and nutrient flows on a global scale. By reconstructing this event, scientists can better model ancient ocean currents, climate feedback loops, and the deep-time mechanisms that still echo in today’s climate system. In essence, these mud waves are not just relics of a vanished seafloor, they are a geological signature of the forces that have shaped, and continue to shape, Earth’s climate trajectory.Why this discovery matters: from paleoceanography to climate modellingKnowing that the Atlantic began to take shape around 117 million years ago, evidence preserved in those colossal buried mud waves, significantly sharpens scientists’ ability to model ancient ocean behaviour, tectonic shifts, and climate feedback loops. This revised timeline offers a clearer window into how early ocean gateways controlled the movement of heat across the planet, regulated carbon sequestration in marine sediments, and set the stage for long-term cooling or warming trends.By tracing these deep-time processes, researchers can better understand the intricate relationship between ocean circulation and Earth’s climate system. Crucially, such knowledge is not confined to the past, it provides a framework for anticipating the effects of today’s oceanic changes. From accelerating polar ice melt to shifting global currents, the same mechanisms that once shaped the Cretaceous world could, in altered form, dictate the trajectory of our future climate.Also read| Study reveals nature's hardest teeth: Chitons inspire future material designAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Entire villages have been wiped out, mass burials are underway, and hundreds remain missing as rescue efforts continue amidst warnings of more torrential rains. The scale of destruction is immense, with eyewitnesses recounting homes and vehicles swept away.  NEW DELHI: Entire villages have been wiped out and mass burials are taking place as flash floods wreak havoc across Pakistan, leaving at least 340 people dead and hundreds missing, news agency AFP reported. Officials and eyewitnesses described scenes of large-scale devastation, with homes, shops and vehicles swept away in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, the hardest-hit region.Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Prime Minister’s coordinator for KP affairs, Ikhtiar Wali Khan, warned the real toll could be far higher. “Entire villages have been wiped out. In Buner's Chagharzi area, massive destruction has taken place, while the village of Bashoni has completely disappeared from the map,” he told ARY News. Expressing fear that deaths in Dir alone could exceed 1,000, he added, “Mass burials are taking place. I have returned from Buner with a heavy heart after witnessing this disaster with my own eyes.”According to Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), torrential monsoon rains, flash floods, and landslides since June 26 have killed at least 657 people, including 171 children and 94 women, and injured 929. KP province alone has reported 390 deaths.PollShould international aid be prioritized for the flood victims in Pakistan?Yes, immediate aid is essentialNo, local resources should be utilized firstRescue workers continue to search for survivors, but officials admit hopes are fading. In Buner district, more than 150 people remain missing, with “10 to 12 entire villages” partially buried, according to local authorities. “The chances of those buried under the debris surviving are very slim,” said Bilal Ahmad Faizi of KP’s rescue agency.Eyewitnesses recalled the horror as floodwaters swept away everything in their path. “We saw all the houses, buildings, and vehicles being swept away like pieces of wood. When we looked down from the mountain, our home was gone,” said Suleman Khan, a schoolteacher who lost 25 relatives in Buner.Officials say the devastation is on par with past climate disasters in Pakistan. The government has declared several mountainous districts disaster-hit, while warnings of more torrential rains in the coming days raise fears of further destruction.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The deluge washed away roads, damaged homes, and disrupted train services on the Jammu-Pathankot line. Rescue operations are underway, with the Army, NDRF, and SDRF assisting victims.  NEW DELHI: A cloudburst in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kathua district has left at least seven people dead and several others injured, triggering landslides, flash floods and large-scale disruption. The incident, which occurred late Saturday night in Jodh Ghati village, washed away roads, damaged homes, and forced authorities into urgent rescue and relief operations.Train services along the vital Jammu-Pathankot line have also been suspended as rising water levels crossed danger marks on a key railway bridge. Helicopter evacuations have been launched, while multiple agencies including the Army, NDRF, SDRF and police are on the ground to restore connectivity and assist victims.Here are the top developments:Death toll rises to seven in KathuaOfficials confirmed that seven people have died in two separate incidents of cloudburst and landslide in Kathua. Five casualties occurred in Jodh Ghati following flash floods triggered by the overnight downpour, while two more died after a landslide in Janglote.Jammu Divisional Commissioner Ramesh Kumar said, “There was heavy rain in Kathua since last night... Seven people have died due to the landslide. Rescue operations are ongoing... Those who died due to the landslide, their bodies have been retrieved.” Rescue teams are still combing through debris and flood-hit areas amid fears of more missing persons. Helicopters were pressed into service due to washed-away roads and villages cut off from access.Train traffic disrupted on Jammu-Pathankot lineRail connectivity has been badly affected with the suspension of up-line train movement between Kathua and Budhi. Senior Divisional Commercial Manager, Jammu Railway Division, Uchit Singhal, said: “Due to heavy rains, water is flowing above the danger level through bridge number 43 between Kathua-Budhi. In view of this, temporarily till the water level subsides, up-line movement has been suspended, and in the meantime, up trains are being moved via a temporary single line through the down line track.” Villages cut off after flash floods and landslidesThe cloudburst snapped access to Jodh Ghati village, where floodwaters swept through homes and agricultural fields, leaving families stranded. Several connecting roads were washed away, and a bridge collapsed, worsening the situation. Deputy Commissioner Kathua Rajesh Sharma confirmed that rescue operations are underway and that stranded people are being shifted to safer areas. Local police reported that a station building in Kathua had also been damaged. Rescue operations led by Army and NDRFThe Indian Army, NDRF, SDRF, police and BRO have been deployed in full strength across Kathua. Heavy machinery has been brought in to fragment massive boulders that rolled down into residential areas. Inspector General of Police, Jammu Zone, Bhim Sen Tuti, said, “Boulders had fallen here which needed to be fragmented... Heavy machinery has been called for that. With the help of BRO, they are being fragmented here. These boulders are being removed by using explosives wherever needed, and bodies have been recovered from beneath them.”Helicopter evacuation for injured victimsUnion minister Jitendra Singh confirmed that helicopter services were arranged to shift injured people to nearby hospitals. In his social media post, Singh wrote, “Helicopter services have been arranged for shifting the injured to appropriate hospitals. 6 injured have been airlifted for hospitalisation in Mamoon, Pathankot, which was found to be relatively nearer destination.” DIG Police Shiv Kumar Sharma and his team are camping at the site and coordinating airlifts. Centre closely monitoring situation, says Amit ShahUnion home minister Amit Shah assured full support from the Central government. In a post on X, Shah wrote, “Spoke with the Lieutenant Governor and Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir regarding the cloudburst in Kathua. Relief and rescue operations are being carried out by the local administration, and NDRF teams have also been rushed to the site. Assured every support from the Modi government. We stand firmly behind our sisters and brothers of J&K.” LG Manoj Sinha calls tragedy 'mind-numbing'Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha expressed grief over the loss of lives. In his message on X, he wrote: “Deeply anguished by the loss of lives in the devastating rain-triggered landslides in several areas of Kathua. The tragedy is mind-numbing. Briefed Hon’ble Union Home Minister Sh. Amit Shah Ji on rescue and relief operations by the army, NDRF, SDRF, police & administration.” CM Omar Abdullah announces ex-gratia reliefChief minister Omar Abdullah conveyed condolences and directed immediate assistance for affected families. A statement from his office said Rs 2 lakh would be given for each deceased, Rs 1 lakh for severely injured, and Rs 50,000 for those with minor injuries. Compensation has also been announced for damaged homes: Rs 1 lakh for fully damaged houses, Rs 50,000 for severely damaged houses, and Rs 25,000 for partially damaged houses. “The Chief Minister has directed the administration to carry out immediate relief, rescue and evacuation measures to ensure the safety and support of affected families,” the statement said.Repeated cloudburst disasters in J&KThe Kathua disaster comes just three days after a cloudburst in Kishtwar’s Chisoti village killed 60 people and injured over 100. Experts warn that frequent extreme weather in J&K is linked to changing rainfall patterns and climate pressures in the Himalayan region. Officials say the back-to-back incidents highlight the need for stronger disaster preparedness and better drainage infrastructure. While the state government has sought central assistance, locals in Kathua have urged long-term flood protection measures. This includes improved embankments, real-time weather alerts, and a review of building norms in vulnerable areas.Connectivity and services slowly being restoredAuthorities are now focused on restoring essential services, including power, water and road links. In Kishtwar, where floods occurred earlier, officials said blasting of boulders was undertaken to clear blocked roads. Rope bridges are being built to reconnect cut-off villages in Kathua. “The power supply and water supply have been restored. A bridge is being built here with the help of the Army... All the passengers stranded in Machail were safely evacuated yesterday,” said Divisional Commissioner Ramesh Kumar.

A cruel summer as record wildfires scorch Europe
Wildfires continue to test firefighters and locals across Europe as droughts and heatwaves turn regions into tinderboxes. The data for 2025 alone is a sign of things to come.

The data for 2025 alone is a sign of things to come. A cruel summer as record wildfires scorch Europe Wildfires continue to burn across the south of Europe amid record-breaking summer heatwaves in many fire-prone regions. In some places, these fires have been exacerbated by wet spring months, which have helped vegetation growth capable of catching alight with ease during a dry summer.Already, an area equivalent to 1.5 times the size of Luxembourg — roughly 438,568 hectares — has burned across Europe in 2025. That figure is almost three times the size of fire damaged caused up to the same point in 2024.It comes as some parts of southern Europe suffer through multiple 40-degree (104 Fahrenheit) days, and prolonged heatwaves lasting a fortnight.The current summer has been described as the worst for wildfires in two decades.Where are the fires burning? What is the situation right now?"We're seeing extreme temperatures in large parts of Europe, records being broken of 40 degrees in many places," said Julie Berckmans, a climate scientist at the European Environmental Agency."Southern France, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Belgium, Netherlands, UK, are all hitting high temperatures [and] massive wildfires in Spain, Portugal, France, Greece, Turkey, Albania."In Spain, those fires have burned through an area the size of London already.Portugal is fighting its own fires, with around four thousand firefighters currently active across seven active sites. It has also been forced to request help from the European Union's firefighting forces.An even greater number of firefighters has been mobilized in Greece, which is battling 20 blazes during this peak fire season.Deaths have occurred in Spain, Portugal, Montenegro and Italy from fires and heat-related events this summer.It has been a severe fire seasonEurope uses data from its Copernicus satellite fleet to monitor fire activity, and collates the data via the European Forest Fires Information System (EFFIS).A substantial amount of fire damage in 2025 has already occured.More than 250,000 hectares more of land has burnt than the same time in 2024.There have more than 1,600 fires across Europe, compared to just under 1,100 last year.And new regions are also experiencing greater than usual fire activity.Spain, for instance, has seen twice as much of its territory burned-through compared to the 2006-2024 average. Romania has lost four times as much land to fires this year.Cyprus has been badly impacted. It could usually expect to see around 0.32% of its landmass burned each year. Already in 2025 it's 2.5% — nearly eight times more.But it's also the number of fires that is concerning. France has had nearly three times as many fires as average amid what has been the worst wildfire season for its southern regions in decades.More to come...The fallout of severe wildfires goes beyond land loss or human fatalities. Damage to ecosystems through vegetation loss, health impacts through smoke inhalation, and economic decline are all consequences of widespread fire events."It's about €2.5 billion [$2.9 billion] of damage lost every year in the EU," Berckmans told DW. "45,000 people on average were displaced due to wildfires from 2008 to 2023."The European Environment Agency's first climate risk assessment, published in 2024, found that urgent action is required to address the critical risk wildfires will pose to populations and infastructure and biodiversity in southern Europe."Wildfires are an urgent risk to address," said Berckmans. "It's also a major risk that needs more action now in the rest of Europe."As European fall approaches, the number of fires and the damage they cause should slow. However forecasting the length of fire danger season, and the behavior of fires themselves, is becoming more difficult.Climate change will not only generate warmer and drier conditions across southern Europe, it will also begin to change other dynamic factors.Faster and more volatile wind systems, for instance, will increase the challenge for fire management personnel to predict how blazes will behave. That puts the lives of emergency workers and civilians at greater risk."Picture a fire so fierce, so fast, and so unpredictable it seems alive, capable of reshaping the weather around it and leaping across kilometers in a heartbeat," said Antonio Lopez, an expert in wildfires at the University of Seville, Spain.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousNew blood pressure guideline by American Heart Association: Key takeawaysLifestyle‘Coolie’ star Shruti Haasan turns heads with her stunning style momentseEntertainmentAishwarya Khare’s off-screen chic lookstvIn pic: Radiant pictures of Shruti HaasanEntertainmentIn pics: Preity Mukhundhan’s stylish wardrobe collectionEntertainmentPallavi Gowda’s top 10 traditional lookstvSai Pallavi’s ethereal charmEntertainmentFatty liver disease: Warning signs one should not ignoreLifestyleJanhvi Kapoor’s mesmerising saree game is giving sleepless nights to other actresses!LifestyleA look at Sidharth Malhotra's dapper fashion momentsEntertainment Next123 Photostories  5 hints your friendship is costing your mental healthAkshay Kumar to Sourabh Raaj Jain : Actors who played Lord Krishna on screenWeird things snakes eat: From eggs to… themselves?

India is ahead in clean energy commitments, achieves 2030 goal five years early In what could be considered as a landmark moment for India's clean energy journey, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, from the ramparts of the Red Fort, on Friday announced that the nation has achieved its 50 per cent clean energy target in 2025 -- a full five years ahead of the 2030 deadline.Marking Independence Day celebrations, the Prime Minister announced and hailed the achievement as a pivotal step towards an Atmanirbhar Bharat in the energy sector, underscoring the country's transformation from a fossil-fuel-dependent importer to a global clean energy leader."When the world today expresses concern over global warming, I wish to tell the world that Bharat has resolved to achieve 50 per cent clean energy by 2030. That was our target for 2030. Look at the capability of my countrymen, look at their determination to fulfil the resolve of making Bharat developed--we achieved the 50 per cent clean energy target in 2025 itself, five years ahead of schedule. This is because we are as sensitive towards the world as we are responsible towards nature," PM Modi said on the occasion of 79th Independence.At COP26 held in 2021, India committed to an ambitious five-part "Panchamrit" pledge.This included reaching 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity, generating half of all energy requirements from renewables, and reducing emissions by 1 billion tonnes by 2030. India also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent and achieve net-zero emissions by 2070.According to the latest government data, India added a record 29.52 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity in 2024-25, taking total installed renewable energy (RE) capacity to 234.24 GW (excluding nuclear), up from 198.75 GW last year.Solar energy leads the charge, with installed capacity skyrocketing from just 2.82 GW in 2014 to 116.24 GW today, now accounting for nearly half of India's total RE capacity.Wind power follows at 51.67 GW, while large and small hydro contribute 54.72 GW combined. Biopower has also grown to 11.59 GW over the past decade.India now ranks 4th globally in total RE capacity, 3rd in solar power, and 4th in wind energy, boasting the world's fastest-growing renewable program.The clean energy surge has been powered by a suite of ambitious government reforms and programs.The PM-Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana, with a Rs 75,021 crore outlay, aims to provide free solar electricity to one crore households.As of August 14, 2025, over 17.24 lakh households have benefitted, with subsidies worth Rs 9,841.77 crore released. The scheme also introduced Model Solar Villages to promote decentralised clean power at the grassroots level.In agriculture, the PM-KUSUM scheme has installed over 8.53 lakh solar pumps, replacing diesel-powered systems and cutting an estimated 6.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.Beyond solar, India is expanding in wind, hydro, bioenergy, green hydrogen, and nuclear power. Offshore wind projects, backed by a Rs 7,453 crore viability gap funding scheme, are set to add 1 GW capacity off Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.The National Green Hydrogen Mission, with a Rs 19,744 crore budget, targets 5 million metric tonnes (MMT) annual production by 2030, along with 125 GW of new RE, Rs 8 lakh crore in investments, and 6 lakh jobs. Hydrogen hubs have been identified in Kandla, Paradip, and Tuticorin.In the nuclear sector, operational capacity has grown from 4,780 MW in 2014 to 8,780 MW across 25 reactors, with a remarkable 87 per cent plant load factor in 2024-25. Ten new reactors are already functional, and capacity is set to increase tenfold by 2047."The result is a virtuous cycle: local manufacturing creates jobs and resilience, competitive tariffs make clean energy affordable, and inclusive programs bring every citizen into the transition. As we look ahead to 2030 and beyond, India is not just meeting global commitments -- it is setting a new template for how a nation can grow, decarbonise, and remain self-reliant. In the journey from energy dependence to energy leadership, the momentum is unmistakable, and the destination is clear: an Atmanirbhar Bharat, powered by its own clean, green energy," the government said today, in a factsheet.With five years gained on its clean energy target, India is now firmly on track to meet, and potentially exceed, its 500 GW non-fossil capacity goal by 2030, positioning itself as a decisive force in the global fight against climate change.

But time is running out fast," he added. Representative image LONDON: A multi-million pound conservation programme in England helped save 150 struggling species but "time is running out" to halt the decline, the head of Natural England, which led the initiative, said Wednesday.The public body, responsible for protecting and enhancing England's natural environment, invested a £13 million ($17.6 million) grant in efforts to support animal and plant species such as water vole, oystercatcher, lady's slipper orchid, the hazel dormouse and Atlantic salmon. "From the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall to Cumbria and Northumberland, 63 different projects involving 78 partners have transformed landscapes and supported the recovery of 150 species, many of which were on the brink of national extinction, through research, captive breeding, habitat creation, and conservation translocations," the body said in a statement released Wednesday.More than 15,000 individual animals and plants were translocated to expand species territories under the projects, which ran from August 2023 to March 2025. Notable successes include the reintroduction of black grouse to the North Yorkshire Moors, northern England, and the return of the large marsh grasshopper to the Norfolk Broads in east England after an 85-year absence. Despite the achievements, the chair of Natural England Tony Juniper warned more needed to be done. "A rising number of nature recovery projects, both large and small, are making a huge difference up and down the country," he said in the press release."We know we can turn round species decline and improve ecosystems with the right targeted actions, the drive and the funding. But time is running out fast," he added.Juniper called for more projects, more volunteers and more investment, particularly from the private sector.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous10 creatures that can live inside volcanic zonesLifestyleYou’re probably a hater if you’re one of these zodiac signsastrologyHow to set up a planted aquarium at home and the types of fish to keep: 10-step guideLifestyle'Coolie': Rajinikanth to SoubinShahir'spay revealed!EntertainmentAlia Bhatt’s hairstylist warns against straightening damp hair: Know why we agree with himLifestyleZodiac signs who are known for their simplicityastrologyDO NOT ignore these warning signs of a heart attackLifestyleDipika Kakar’s top 10 gorgeous ethnic looks for festive seasontvJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than Wordstv Next123 Photostories  Janmashtami 2025: 5 savoury snacks perfect for fasting and feasting5 veggies to pair with Rajma (kidney beans) to boost its fiber contentThese foods can reduce the cooking time of meat5 last-minute weekend trips from Delhi you can plan right now!From Varsha to Divinesh: A look at the winners of Sa Re Ga Ma Pa TamilIndependence Day: Unveiling 10 rare pictures from India’s struggle for freedom7 foods to strictly avoid in monsoon seasonGuard deployed, protests erupt: National Guard steps up presence in Washington; 10 things to knowMovies that made us question everything we thought we knewSara Tendulkar’s protein drinks: How to make them and their benefits123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillVanessa BryantDwyane WadeKyrie lrvingNHL Trade RumorsRaj KundraWhy Roblox Get Banned in QatarMega Slowbro solo in Pokemon GOJohnny SomalisBrock Lesnar Net WorthTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteAir Arabia reports AED 415 million net profit in Q2 2025 despite regional disruptionsUAE heatwave alert: Temperatures to soar to 46°C in Dubai and Abu DhabiUAE: Etihad hits record 20.3 million passengers in 12 months for the first timeUkraine-Russia conflict: Zelenskyy arrives in London, meets UK PM Starmer ahead of Trump-Putin's Alaska summitWhat is David G.

Typhoon Podul intensifies as its near Taiwan
Typhoon Podul crossed southern Taiwan, prompting school and office closures due to heavy rain and potential agricultural damage. While no major damage was reported in Taiwan, one person is missing on the east coast. In China, coastal provinces evacuated around 15,000 residents as the storm moved towards the Taiwan Strait, impacting flights and regions south of Taipei.

KAOHSIUNG: Thousands of people sheltered and fishermen secured their boats across storm-battered southern Taiwan on Wednesday as Typhoon Podul intensified on its approach to the island.The typhoon is packing wind speeds of 155 kilometres (96 miles) per hour at its centre and "is strengthening", Central Weather Administration (CWA) forecaster Lin Ting-yi told AFP.Podul is on track to hit lightly populated Taitung County at around noon (0400 GMT) before sweeping across the island and into the Taiwan Strait."We are worried about this typhoon," Kaohsiung fisherman Huang Wei told AFP as he used more ropes to tie down his boat and checked on other vessels."We had already made general typhoon preparations yesterday, but this morning I woke up and saw news reports that the typhoon has intensified to be as strong as the last, (Typhoon) Krathon," Huang said."Last time, the two boats behind us weren't tied properly and hit my boat."Krathon slammed into Kaohsiung in October, with wind gusts of 162kph. Podul has gusts of 191kph, Lin said. More than 5,500 people have been evacuated from their homes ahead of Podul, disaster officials said Wednesday, as the typhoon threatens to pound central and southern regions that are still recovering from storms last month.Mountainous areas of Kaohsiung City and neighbouring Pingtung County, as well as Hualien and Taitung counties, could see torrential rain, the CWA said.All domestic flights across the island of 23 million people have been cancelled, along with dozens of international journeys.Many ferry services have been suspended and businesses and schools across the south closed.Typhoon Danas, which hit Taiwan in early July, killed two people and injured hundreds as the storm dumped more than 500mm (about 20 inches) of rain across the south over a weekend.That was followed by torrential rain from July 28 to August 4, with some areas recording more than Taiwan's rainfall of 2.1 metres for 2024.The week of bad weather left five people dead, three missing, and 78 injured, a disaster official said previously.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 expensive animal-shaped bags that’ll leave you almost shocked!Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?Maharashtra’s UNESCO World Heritage Sites and other iconic monuments for history loversRajinikanth completes 50 years in cinema: Lesser-known facts about the ‘Coolie’ star6 lizards that prove reptiles can be adorable123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

Momentum sagging at UN plastic pollution treaty talks
Talks on forging a landmark treaty to combat the scourge of plastic pollution were stumbling Saturday, with progress slow and countries wildly at odds on how far the proposed agreement should go. The talks are mandated to look at the full life cycle of plastic, from production to pollution, but some countries are unhappy with such a wide scope.

Representative image GENEVA: Talks on forging a landmark treaty to combat the scourge of plastic pollution were stumbling Saturday, with progress slow and countries wildly at odds on how far the proposed agreement should go.The negotiations, which opened on Tuesday, have four working days left to strike a legally-binding instrument that would tackle the growing problem choking the environment.In a blunt mid-way assessment, talks chair Luis Vayas Valdivieso warned the 184 countries negotiating at the United Nations that they had to get shifting to get a deal."Progress made has not been sufficient," Vayas told delegates."A real push to achieve our common goal is needed," the Ecuadoran diplomat said, adding that Thursday was not a just deadline but "a date by which we must deliver."Some articles still have unresolved issues and show little progress towards reaching a common understanding," Vayas lamented.The key fracture is between countries that want to focus on waste management and others who want a more ambitious treaty that also cuts production and eliminates use of the most toxic chemicals.And with the talks relying on finding consensus, it has become a game of brinkmanship.A diplomatic source told reporters that many informal meetings had been scrambled together for Sunday's day off to try and break the deadlock."If nothing changes, we won't get there," the source added.Battle of the bracketsCountries have reconvened in Geneva after the failure of the supposedly fifth and final round of negotiations in Busan, South Korea in 2024.After four days of talks, the draft text has ballooned from 22 to 35 pages -- with the number of brackets in the text going up near five-fold to almost 1,500 as countries insert a blizzard of conflicting wishes and ideas.The talks are mandated to look at the full life cycle of plastic, from production to pollution, but some countries are unhappy with such a wide scope.Kuwait spoke up for the so-called Like-Minded Group -- a nebulous cluster of mostly oil-producing nations which rejects production limits and wants to focus on treating waste."Let us agree on what we can agree. Consensus must be the basis of all our decisions," Kuwait insisted.Nudging in the same direction, Saudi Arabia, speaking for the Arab Group, said the responsible way ahead was to start considering what bits of the text "may not make it to the final outcome due to irreconcilable divergence".But given how little is truly agreed on, Uruguay warned that consensus "cannot be used as a justification to not achieve our objectives".Eirik Lindebjerg, global plastics adviser for the World Wide Fund for Nature, told AFP that the Like-Minded Group's proposal was "another attempt to make it a waste management agreement", and to stifle talks on reducing the amount of plastic in circulation.Path through the fogThe UN Environment Programme is hosting the talks and swiftly called a press conference after the stock-take session.UNEP executive director Inger Andersen said a deal was "really within our grasp, even though today it might not look so"."Despite the fog of negotiations I'm really encouraged," she told reporters, insisting: "There is a pathway to success."Vayas added: "We need to accelerate. We need a better rhythm in this and we need to also work in such a way that it will be clear that we will deliver by the end."Afterwards, Bjorn Beeler, executive director at IPEN, a global network aimed at limiting toxic chemicals, told AFP: "This whole process has not been able to take decisions and is still collecting ideas. We're sleepwalking towards a cliff and if we don't wake up, we're falling off."'Profits from poisoning'Plastic pollution is so ubiquitous that microplastics have been found on the highest mountain peaks, in the deepest ocean trench and scattered throughout almost every part of the human body.More than 400 million tonnes of plastic are produced globally each year, half of which is for single-use items.Plastic production is set to triple by 2060.Panama's negotiator Juan Monterrey Gomez took the floor to slam those countries wanting to stop the treaty from encompassing the entire life cycle of plastic.He said microplastics "are in our blood, in our lungs and in the first cry of a new-born child. Our bodies are living proof of a system that profits from poisoning us". "We cannot recycle our way out of this crisis."End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksGlobal Standard indexUS stocks todayIndia-US tariffIntel CEOMukesh AmbaniUS jobless dataRussia crude oilTop TrendingTyreek HillSelena GomezKim KardashianTaylor SwiftTravis KelceBill Belichicks GirlfriendNBA Trade RumorsDwyane WadesShannon SharpeMike VrabelTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteTyreek Hill, ex Keeta Vaccaro rush baby Capri to ER;

Climate heat extremes driving tropical bird decline: study
Tropical bird populations have plummeted not only due to deforestation but also extreme heat attributable to climate change, according to a study published on Monday in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.  Another study published in 2017 showed how some tropical hummingbirds are now forced to seek shade to regulate their temperature in extreme heat, cutting into the amount of time they can spend searching for life-sustaining nectar.

Another study published in 2017 showed how some tropical hummingbirds are now forced to seek shade to regulate their temperature in extreme heat, cutting into the amount of time they can spend searching for life-sustaining nectar.  Representative image PARIS: Tropical bird populations have plummeted not only due to deforestation but also extreme heat attributable to climate change, according to a study published on Monday in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. Intensifying temepratures caused a 25-38 percent reduction in tropical bird populations between 1950 and 2020, compared to a scenario without manmade global warming, scientists based in Europe and Australia reported. "The findings are pretty stark," lead author Maximilian Kotz, a researcher at the National Supercomputing Centre in Barcelona and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), told AFP.Bird populations in the tropics now face 30 days of heat extremes per year compared to three per year in the mid-20th century, he noted. "This has major consequences for how we think about biodiversity conservation," Kotz said by email. "Protecting pristine habitats is crucial, but without dealing with climate change it won't be enough for birds."Nearly half of all bird species are found in biodiversity-rich tropical regions. These often colourful animals perform essential services for ecosystems, such as dispersing plant seeds. Invasive species another threatBut birds living in these regions may already be "close to the limits" of their tolerance to high temperatures, which can cause heatstroke (hyperthermia) or dehydration. The overview study does not provide figures for individual species, but earlier literature is rich with examples of the devastating impact of rising temperatures.One documented the heat-related decline of birds in Panama, including the king quetzal, the red-crested quetzal, the two-coloured kingfisher and the aurora trogon. Another study published in 2017 showed how some tropical hummingbirds are now forced to seek shade to regulate their temperature in extreme heat, cutting into the amount of time they can spend searching for life-sustaining nectar. Extreme heat waves, which are becoming more frequent, represent a far greater threat than increases in average temperatures or rainfall, another result of human-induced climate change. Up to now, it has been assumed that the decline in bird populations worldwide was due mainly to other well-identified factors, especially habitat loss, pesticide use, hunting, and invasive species, especially snakes that snack on bird eggs and mosquitos carrying avian malaria. But the new findings "challenge the view that direct human pressures have so far been the dominant driver of impacts on bird populations compared to climate change in tropical regions," according to the authors. To reach this conclusion, they analysed observational data from more than 3,000 bird populations around the world and used statistical modelling to isolate the effects of extreme weather from other factors.The findings help complete the picture of tropical bird decline, noted Aimee Van Tatenhove, a post-doctoral fellow at Cornell University's Center for Avian Population Studies who was not involved in the study."Deforestation has an obvious impact -- trees are cut and habitat is destroyed," she told AFP. "We need long-term datasets like the authors used to understand how extreme temperatures impact avian populations.""This study is an important reminder that we need to continue examining different causes of population declines and apply those findings to conservation initiatives," she continued.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  From Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leavesTop 5 Getaways in North and South India to Work RemotelyFrom Cristiano Ronaldo’s million-dollar sparkler to Arjun Tendulkar’s intimate proposal: Celebrity engagements that created buzz in 2025Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 expensive animal-shaped bags that’ll leave you almost shocked!Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

Silopi, a city in the Sirnak province, is located around 10 kilometres from the Iraq and Syrian borders. It shattered the previous national high of 49.5 C recorded in August 2023 in the western province of Eskisehir. Turkey has faced weeks of scorching heat along with several wildfires. Fourteen people lost their lives battling blazes last month in the western part of the country. Hundreds of people were evacuated on Friday in the northwest province of Canakkale, where the busy Dardanelles Strait was closed to maritime traffic due to two raging fires. The heatwave has also prompted fears of water shortages in some areas. The resort town of Cesme on the Aegean Sea has restricted tap water for residents and tourists between 11:00 pm to 6:00 am since July 25.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksGlobal Standard indexUS stocks todayIndia-US tariffIntel CEOMukesh AmbaniUS jobless dataRussia crude oilTop TrendingTyreek HillSelena GomezKim KardashianTaylor SwiftTravis KelceBill Belichicks GirlfriendNBA Trade RumorsDwyane WadesShannon SharpeMike VrabelTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteTyreek Hill, ex Keeta Vaccaro rush baby Capri to ER;

Representative image (Image: AP) LAGRASSE: A wildfire in southern France slowed overnight into Wednesday after injuring nine people and burning through 11,000 hectares of vegetation, local officials said. The blaze, which started on Tuesday afternoon, is still threatening several villages in the aude department, where 1,500 firefighters have been battling to extinguish it."The fire is advancing in an area where all the conditions are ripe for it to progress. We are monitoring the edges and the back of the fire to prevent flare-ups," said Lucie Roesch, secretary general of the qude prefecture.She said firefighters are expecting to receive aerial support at dawn, but warned "this fire will keep us busy for several days. It's a long-term operation".The fire's advance slowed overnight due to high humidity levels, she added.One person was seriously burned and another injured, the prefecture said, adding that seven firefighters were also hurt. Camping grounds and one village were partially evacuated, and several local roads have been closed."All of the Nation's resources are mobilised," French president Emmanuel Macron said on X, while calling on people to exercise "the utmost caution".The qude department has seen an increase in areas burnt in recent years, aggravated by low rainfall and the removal of vineyards, which used to help break the progression of fires.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle10 baby names that mean creativity and visionLifestyleWhen looks can be deceptive: 10 ‘PRETTY’ killers in the animal worldLifestyleBirthday Special: Spine-chilling quotes of Alfred Hitchcock that will keep you up at nightLifestyleSet up a mini lotus pond at home with these easy tipsLifestyleAttractive looks of Srithika Saneeshtv10 creatures that can walk on waterLifestyleSheet masks out, Kareena Kapoor Khan’s DIY napkin mask inLifestyleBhagyashri Borse charms with her gorgeous outfitsEntertainmentMost affordable diesel cars under Rs 12 lakh: Kia Syros, Mahindra Thar and moreauto Next123 Photostories  6 lizards that prove reptiles can be adorableHow to unrot your brain: 5 effective steps to sharpen focus and boost mental clarityFrom Mullum Malarum to Kabali: Rajinikanth’s most emotional movies that fans still cherishLegends reborn – Bollywood actors who came back strongKyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi 2: Smriti Irani, Amar Upadhyay and other stars' educational qualificationGreen, pink and purple — jaw-dropping Northern Lights photos you won’t believe are realFrom Munshi Ranjeet to David John: Bigg Boss Malayalam contestants who faced first-week evictionAdorable baby shower photos of Bigg Boss Telugu fame Soniya'RRR,' 'Kaalapani,' and 'Major': South Indian films that celebrate IndiaNayanthara's classic films to watch123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillJessica RadcliffeLebron JamesBasanti ChatterjeePatrick MahomesGautam AdaniElon MuskIndia Nayara EnergyCJI GavaiBengaluru Student AttackTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteImmigration crackdown: Venezuelan civic groups sue Trump admin over termination of Temporary Protected Status; call it cruelty towards vulnerableFormer Platters band member Sandra Hall goes missing, last seen on Friday in Brooklyn; search under wayUAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed sends firefighting team to aid Albania’s wildfire battleRoad safety improves sharply in Kuwait: Accidents down 45%, deaths down 34% in first half of 2025Kuwait: No more minimum salary requirement for family visit visas, what expats need to knowTurkish Airlines and Oman Air frequent flyer partnership: Travelers can now earn miles across both airlines‘Take our capital back’: Nearly 800 troops deployed by Donald Trump arrive at DC; 23 individuals arrested overnightBahrain stands tall: Ranks 3rd in Arab region in new UN Human Development reportUAE: What is Abu Dhabi's ‘Hayat’ program?

AI image ALGIERS: At a beach near Algiers, brown algae native to the Pacific Ocean cover the golden sand, posing a threat to ecosystems native to the area and their stench repelling swimmers at the peak of summer.Following a recent government call to help clear beaches swarmed by the seaweed species known scientifically as Rugulopteryx okamurae, several volunteers and charities have stepped in."When it washes up, we can't swim," said Salim Hemmedi, a 43-year-old vacationer at a beach in Sidi Fredj, where volunteers raked up heaps of the plant."We hope the situation will improve so that we can enjoy ourselves... and that children can swim in peace."The alga originates from temperate waters around Japan and the Korean peninsula in the northwest Pacific Ocean.It was first spotted in Algeria in late 2023, according to Lamia Bahbah, a lecturer and researcher at the National School of Marine Sciences and Coastal Planning.And lately, some have noted that it has been increasingly washed ashore.Youcef Segni, a marine engineer and biologist, said the algae proliferated at a significantly higher rate than in 2023 and 2024."They invade the habitats of other algae in the seabed, which leads to the disappearance of some species," he said, adding that it can also displace some native fish.Fast reproductionIn France, Spain and Portugal, the Rugulopteryx okamurae species has also been observed.Earlier this year, Spanish football club Real Betis introduced kits repurposed from seaweed to raise awareness about the issue.A 2023 study by the Marine Drugs journal said the alga's invasive character led to "a replacement of the native biota and an occupancy rate that reached almost 100 per cent in some locations" in Portugal.In Algeria, the plant has been spotted in at least three of the country's 14 coastal provinces, including the capital where 16 beaches are affected, authorities said."Are the waters suitable for swimming? Yes," said Environment Minister Nadjiba Djilali during the cleanup campaign, adding there were no records of the plant causing allergies.Researcher Bahbah said stopping its proliferation was "unfortunately impossible at this stage".She said the plant reproduces at a high rate, both sexually and asexually.The species can reproduce through fragmentation, meaning new individual algae can develop from fragmented pieces of other Rugulopteryx okamurae algae.The algae spread mainly by clinging to the hulls of boats, and the Mediterranean's moderate temperature favours the seaweed's fast reproduction."We are going to fight it," said Fella Zaboudj, a state engineer in marine sciences, adding that researchers were monitoring its spread, development and evolution.Zaboudj said research was also underway to determine whether the algae could be repurposed as fertiliser.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksSibu SorenPatna Double Decker BridgeSpiceJetRBI MPC MeetRussia OilUS China TradeNSDL IPO allotmentTop TrendingTrinity RodmanDe'Aaron FoxConnor BedardDennis RodmanRussell WilsonMitch MarnersKirby DachMatthew TkachukConnor McDavidAdam RuzickaTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website'Will raise tariff substantially in 24 hours': Donald Trump fires fresh salvo;

Ireland's wind energy sector has long been touted as full of potential. AI image BANGOR: On Ireland's blustery western seaboard, researchers are gleefully flying giant kites, not for fun but in the hope of generating renewable electricity and sparking a "revolution" in wind energy."We use a kite to capture the wind and a generator at the bottom of it that captures the power," Padraic Doherty of Kitepower, the Dutch firm behind the venture, told AFP. At its test site in operation since September 2023 near the small town of Bangor Erris, the team transports the vast 60-square-metre (645,000-square-feet) kite from a hangar across the lunar-like bogland to a generator. The kite is then attached by a cable tether to the machine and acts like a "yo-yo or fishing reel", Doherty said."It gets cast out and flies up, the tether pulls it back in, over and over again, creating energy," he said, testing the kite's ropes and pulleys before a flight.The sparsely populated spot near the stormy Atlantic coast is the world's first designated airborne renewable energy test site. And although the idea is still small in scale, it could yet prove to be a mighty plan as Ireland seeks to cut its reliance on fossil fuels such as oil and gas."We are witnessing a revolution in wind energy," said Andrei Luca, operations head at Kitepower, a zero-emissions energy solutions spin-off from the Delft University of Technology."It took nearly 25 years for wind turbines to evolve from 30-kilowatt prototypes to megawatt scale, and decades to offshore wind farms we see today," he added.The system flies autonomously, driven by software developed at the university in the Netherlands, but Doherty acts as the kite's "pilot" on the ground, monitoring its flight path for efficiency. The kite flies up around 400 metres (1,300 feet) and reels in to about 190 metres, generating around 30 kilowatts for storage.The force spins "like a dynamo on a bike", Doherty said, adding that "it generates up to two and a half tonnes of force through each turn".The electricity is stored in batteries, similar to solar photovoltaic systems, with the kite currently able to fully charge a 336-kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery."That's a meaningful amount of energy, sufficient for powering a remote outpost, a small island, polar station, or even a construction site," Luca said."Add additional kites and we can power a bigger island."'Mobile, flexible'According to Doherty, a chief advantage of the kite system is its flexibility and swift start-up capability."We can set up in 24 hours and can bring it anywhere, it's super mobile, and doesn't need expensive, time- and energy-consuming turbine foundations to be built," he said. A kite system is "way less invasive on the landscape (than wind turbines), produces clean energy and doesn't need a supply chain of fuel to keep running", Luca added.During January's Storm Eowyn, which caused widespread and long-lasting power outages in Ireland, the system showed its value in Bangor Erris, according to Luca. "Paired with a battery, it provided uninterrupted electricity before, during and after the storm," he said. Ireland's wind energy sector has long been touted as full of potential.But progress on large-scale delivery of onshore and offshore turbines has been held up by planning delays and electricity grid capacity constraints.The Irish government has set ambitious targets for offshore wind energy to deliver 20 gigawatts of energy by 2040 and at least 37 gigawatts by 2050.In 2024, Irish wind farms provided around a third of the country's electricity according to Wind Energy Ireland (WEI), a lobby group for the sector. This compares to the UK, where, according to trade association RenewableUK, wind energy from the country's combined wind farms first reached 20 gigawatts in November 2022.The ability of airborne wind energy (AWE) systems to harness high-altitude winds with relatively low infrastructure requirements "makes them particularly suitable for remote, offshore or mobile applications," Mahdi Salari, an AWE researcher at University College Cork, told AFP.But he said Kitepower would face challenges on "regulation, safety, and system reliability". Such technology however could plug gaps in places where "land availability, costs or logistical constraints hinder the deployment of traditional wind turbines", Salari said.By the 2030s, he said: "I expect AWE to contribute meaningfully to diversified, flexible and distributed renewable energy networks".Discover stories of India’s leading eco-innovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksSibu SorenPatna Double Decker BridgeSpiceJetGold Price PredectionRussia OilUS China TradeNSDL IPO allotmentTop TrendingRussell WilsonHailee SteinfeldsF1 StandingsDez BryantLebron James WifeRussia Oil ImportsTriple HPrince HarryRJ MahvashAntonio BrownTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteBrooke Hogan’s husband: Hulk Hogan showed no interest in meeting grandkidsDak Prescott builds new mansion, reveals why he razed the last oneTaylor Swift’s Kelce jacket inspires Kristin Juszczyk’s new NFL lineGabrielle Union on menopause: 'It makes it hard' — motherhood now more emotional, exhaustingGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai to employees: ‘I think we have to....'Apple CEO Tim Cook confirms: Majority of new iPhones sold in the US are 'made' in India;

Aalborg Zoo in Denmark is now accepting unwanted small pets as donations to feed its predators. The zoo assures that donated animals like rabbits and guinea pigs will be humanely euthanized before being used as food. This initiative aims to mimic the natural food chain, promoting animal welfare and natural behaviour among captive carnivores.

This initiative aims to mimic the natural food chain, promoting animal welfare and natural behaviour among captive carnivores. (Ai generated image)  If you have a pet you can no longer keep, one zoo in Denmark is offering an unusual option.Aalborg Zoo is asking the public to donate small pets — not for rehoming, but to be used as food for its captive predators.Aalborg Zoo, located in northern Denmark, said in a Facebook post that the move is meant to mimic the natural food chain of animals housed there. The zoo says this effort supports “animal welfare and professional integrity,” and assures that any donated pets will be “gently euthanized” by trained staff.“If you have a healthy animal that needs to be given away for various reasons, feel free to donate it to us,” the post said.The zoo lists rabbits, guinea pigs, horses and chickens as examples of suitable donations.PollWhat do you think about Aalborg Zoo's practice of accepting pets for food for predators?Support it for animal welfareOppose it, find other solutionsOnce euthanised, the animals will be used as fodder for the zoo’s carnivores.“That way, nothing goes to waste — and we ensure natural behaviour, nutrition and well-being of our predators,” the zoo claimed.The post is accompanied by a picture of a wildcat showing its teeth with its mouth wide open. It also includes a link to the zoo’s website.About the zoo Aalborg Zoo was founded in April 1935. The facility is located near the centre of Aalborg and spans 8 hectares. It houses more than 1,500 animals across 126 species and draws hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.According to the zoo’s official website, Aalborg Zoo focuses on conservation, sustainability and education.It takes part in international breeding programmes for endangered species and supports global efforts in animal conservation, research and fair trade. It was also the first zoo in Denmark to receive an environment certificate and is known for its work in protecting nature and the environment.The zoo maintains that the practice of using donated pets as prey aligns with its mission to support natural behaviours in captive predators.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

LISBON: Portugal's government on Saturday issued an alert warning of a heatwave with a high risk of fires in large parts of the country in the coming days.The alert, covering Sunday to Thursday, included a ban on bonfires, fireworks and the use of electrical equipment in forests.The authorities also restricted access to some woodland areas, announced a boost in staffing for the forest ranger service and increased land and air patrols in high fire-risk areas."The next week will be difficult" said Home Affairs Minister Maria Lucia Amaral.Both Portugal and neighbouring Spain have had to battle wildfires in the recent days, a problem they and other countries face every year.Experts say climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of droughts and fires around the world.Following the deadly fire season in 2017, Portugal ramped up its spending on wildfire prevention and response. More than 29,000 hectares (71,600 acres) have already been destroyed by fire since the beginning of the year, according to Portugal's Institute of Forests (ICNF).End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous'Kingom' actor Vijay Deverakonda’s stylish looksEntertainmentVijay Deverakonda’s fitness workout routineEntertainmentTop 10 colour-changing birds of IndiaLifestyleRaksha Bandhan-worthy mehendi designs to try this yearLifestyle10 things to know before getting an Arowana fish for good luckLifestyleMouni Roy’s top 10 gorgeous ethnic lookstvPriya Prakash Varrier serves fierce fashionEntertainmentSouth Actresses dazzle in this week's best photosEntertainmentMost popular baby names of 2024Lifestyle9 Ayurvedic habits to regulate the nervous systemLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Bigg Boss Malayalam 7 contestants Adhila and Noora: All about the lesbian couple who fought a legal battle for loveWhen fame faded Mahima Chaudhry chose to fight not fall5 snake parks in India that are absolutely fang-tastic and what makes them special5 things to know before drinking water in a copper bottleBigg Boss Malayalam 7 contestant Rena Fathima: Who is this 19-year-old influencer?From ‘DDLJ’ to ‘Saiyaara’: 5 Bollywood love stories that gave us hopeful, happy endingsHollywood's 7 BFFs whose friendship stood the test of timeThe Great Indian Kapil Show: From a luxurious house in Madh Island worth approximately Rs 12 crore to net worth, car collection; Archana Puran Singh’s lavish life'Coolie' audio launch highlights: Star-studded speeches, roaring cheers & a grand tribute to Rajinikanth—everything you should not missFrom Thummanpeta to Stardom:Meet the family behind Vijay Deverakonda’s stardom123Hot PicksKamala HarrisIndian NavyJ&K landslideTrump TariffsUPI New RulesGST collectionsJulia HymanTop TrendingWWE Summerslam HighlightsHailee SteinfeldsTop Richest Billionaries in the worldEarthquake VideoLebron James WifeRJ MahvashGerman Influencer BengaluruKannada signboard ruleNayara EnergyIndia US Crude OilTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteHailee Steinfeld's latest workout photos break the internetGabrielle Union on menopause: 'It makes it hard' — motherhood now more emotional, exhaustingIND vs ENG Live: India need eight wickets to level the series 2-2Who is Matt Deitke?

Video/PTI NEW DELHI: Continuous heavy rainfall on Saturday brought large parts of Bihar’s capital Patna to a standstill, causing severe waterlogging and traffic congestion. Visuals from Kurji Road and other low-lying areas showed flooded streets, traffic jams, and pedestrians struggling to navigate waterlogged roads.Kerala Hit by Earliest Monsoon Since 2009 | IMD Predicts Above-Normal Rainfall for 2025The flood-like situation disrupted normal life and exposed administrative lapses in monsoon preparedness. Despite repeated assurances by civic authorities about improved drainage systems and better planning, the city appeared unprepared once again.Commuters faced long traffic jams in various parts of the city, as vehicles were stuck or slowed down due to waterlogging. Pedestrians were seen wading through flooded roads with extreme caution, fearing open manholes, uncovered drains, and the threat of electric shocks from submerged wires and poles.PollWhat do you think is the biggest issue causing urban flooding during monsoon?Poor drainage systemsLack of planning and maintenanceMeanwhile, the India Meteorological Department has predicted heavy rainfall in the region over the next few days.Moreover, contaminated water triggered a diarrhea outbreak in Bihar's Jehanabad.

House razings to save Niger capital's forest shield dismay locals
Hamissou Issiakou grumbled as he worked to strip bare his house, marked for demolition for illegally encroaching on the tip of green forest that's keeping the expanding desert at bay from Niger's capital. Director General of Water and Forests within the environment ministry Yacouba Seybou said on state television that since 2004 "decrees have prohibited housing in the (green) belt".

Director General of Water and Forests within the environment ministry Yacouba Seybou said on state television that since 2004 "decrees have prohibited housing in the (green) belt". Representative image (AFP) NIAMEY: Hamissou Issiakou grumbled as he worked to strip bare his house, marked for demolition for illegally encroaching on the tip of green forest that's keeping the expanding desert at bay from Niger's capital.His is one of nearly 500 homes being bulldozed as the authorities in the arid desert country, which is particularly at risk from man-made global warming, seek to shore up the wooded belt around Niamey's outskirts.Ukraine Launches MASSIVE Drone Attack On Russia; 3 Killed, Over 100 UAVs Shot Down"We've bought our plots of land at great expense. In the end it's a big waste," Issiakou told AFP, after urging workers to hurry up and remove an enormous gate before the police arrive. Since the heavy machinery began rolling in at the end of June, dozens of slums, luxury houses and apartment blocks have tumbled like a house of cards.Some homeowners have just stood by and watched in dismay as the bulldozers tore down their houses. Others, like Issiakou, have rushed to remove anything of value before the two-week notice period was up, from windows, metal sheets and electrical cables to small drinking water tanks and surveillance cameras.All say they bought their land from private real-estate agencies. - 'Submit to Allah' -In a country with one of the highest population growth rates in the world, the number of residents in Niamey has doubled since 2005, from 750,000 to one-and-a-half million, according to the national statistics institute. Thanks to that rapid urbanisation, the forest belt has lost more than half its area since it was completed in 1993 and now measures just 25 kilometres (16 miles) long and a kilometre wide. Hailing from various social classes, the woods' soon-to-be-gone inhabitants were originally attracted to the capital's outskirts by the good quality of life and reasonable cost of a plot. The distance from the bureaucracy within Niamey proper, which can often delay construction projects by years, did not hurt either. Thermos in hand, Aboul-Razak Moussa handed out coffee to the workmen using crowbars to dig up the cobblestones in the courtyard of his brand-new building."I bought the land for 12 million CFA francs ($21,000) and invested 127 million CFA francs (more than $220,000) to build my building," the owner of a welding company lamented."We submit ourselves to Allah." Businessman Ali Hamza was indignant."We're in the peak of the rainy season, it's inhuman," the father-of-10 argued. So far, at least 4,000 people have been evicted and nearly 500 homes, mostly slums, demolished, authorities say.- Rising temperatures -Carparks, petrol stations, pharmacies, shops, rubbish dumps and health centres sprung up to cater for those who made their home in the forested area.The project to introduce a green belt around Niamey is not part of the African Union's flagship Great Green Wall initiative, but its aims are the same.Landlocked Niger lies in the heart of the Sahel, a semiarid region stretching from Senegal to Sudan where temperatures are rising 1.5 times faster than the global average.At the same time, Niger suffers periods of drought and severe flooding.It is "imperative" that Niger "preserves more green spaces", Sani Ayouba, head of the Young Volunteers for the Environment NGO said.Director General of Water and Forests within the environment ministry Yacouba Seybou said on state television that since 2004 "decrees have prohibited housing in the (green) belt".Under the law, offenders face three months to two years in prison.Former ministers have "authorised private housing developments", Boubacar Maman, an official at the urban planning ministry, said.The environment ministry says a zoo and aquatic park as well as a botanic garden, sports and leisure area will soon be created within the forested green belt.bh/bam/bdi/sbk-kjm/yadEnd of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousTransform your boring sandals with trendy DIY embellishmentsLifestyleBhagyashri Borse's style statementsEntertainmentFrom Pulitzer to Orange: 10 prestigious awards given for LiteratureLifestyle10 veggies that can grow in containers in balconyLifestyle'Kingom' actor Vijay Deverakonda’s stylish looksEntertainmentVijay Deverakonda’s fitness workout routineEntertainmentTop 10 colour-changing birds of IndiaLifestyleRaksha Bandhan-worthy mehendi designs to try this yearLifestyle10 things to know before getting an Arowana fish for good luckLifestyleMouni Roy’s top 10 gorgeous ethnic lookstv Next123 Photostories  Top 6 zoos to visit across India for a complete wildlife experience10 minute daily habits that are perfect brain exercisesBigg Boss Malayalam 7 Contestant Aryan Kathuria: All about the handsome actor featured in a Poonam Pandey show6 healthy smart foods for babies when their teeth hurtFrom white themed rooms to aesthetic details: Debinna Bonnerjee’s living and bedroom give peaceful vibesHow to spend 5 days in Madhya Pradesh: The perfect Orchha–Khajuraho itineraryRisk of type 1 diabetes may depend on where childhood is spentBigg Boss Malayalam 7 contestant Abhisree: All about the actor-dancer with an inspiring journey5 filling foods under 50 calories7 key boundaries mentally strong people set to thrive at work123Hot PicksKamala HarrisIndian NavyJ&K landslideTrump TariffsUPI New RulesGST collectionsJulia HymanTop TrendingWWE Summerslam HighlightsHailee SteinfeldsTop Richest Billionaries in the worldEarthquake VideoLebron James WifeRJ MahvashGerman Influencer BengaluruKannada signboard ruleNayara EnergyIndia US Crude OilTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire Website'Disgraceful': Ex-South Korea president Yoon Suk Yeol resists questioning by laying down in underwear;

Southeastern Turkey is reeling under a record-breaking heatwave, with temperatures exceeding 50C in Silopi. Residents are struggling with soaring electricity bills due to constant air conditioning use and are appealing for state support. Deforestation and policy changes allowing mining on agricultural lands exacerbate the heat, intensifying the challenges faced by locals who depend on air conditioning as a necessity.

Residents are struggling with soaring electricity bills due to constant air conditioning use and are appealing for state support. Deforestation and policy changes allowing mining on agricultural lands exacerbate the heat, intensifying the challenges faced by locals who depend on air conditioning as a necessity. Representative Image  A choking heatwave left astonished locals in southeastern Turkey calling for state help to pay their air conditioning bills after the temperature surged past 50 degree celsius."We cannot cope with the heat," ice-cream maker Recep Esiyok, 59, told AFP in Silopi, where meteorologists measured 50.5C on Friday -- a national record."I've been living in Silopi for about 30 years. I've never seen such heat... I've never seen such heat anywhere."He is getting through the heatwave thanks to the air conditioner in his shop, but is now worried about paying for the electricity."My bill last month was 59,000 lira (1,450 dollars). We are asking for state support on this issue."'Incomparable' heat: Before Friday's record, the previous peak in Turkey had been 49.5 degree celsius in August 2023.Scientists agree that climate change caused by humans burning fossil fuels is increasing the likelihood, length and intensity of heatwaves."The heat has reached a point where it's incomparable to previous years," said Halil Coskun, 52, a local reporter.The country is still in the grip of the heatwave and since Sunday temperatures overall have surged from six to 12 degrees above seasonal norms, according to the state meteorology directorate.Wildfire threat: Turkey has fought fires in several regions since the start of the summer. Last week, 10 people perished while fighting a fire in Eskisehir province.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday the country has experienced drier conditions than normal over the past five years as a result of global warming."Extreme heat, low humidity, and strong winds are unfortunately increasing the risk of fire," he said.He said the state was using drones to monitor and protect forests.The streets were relatively empty and the atmosphere tense in Silopi, a Kurdish city whose main income is trade with Iraq across the border 10 kilometres (six miles) away."When it's hot, there's no one outside during the day," said Esiyok.Deforestation complaints: Other locals complained at the lack of vegetation to provide relief around the town, which lies at the foot of a mountain."Unfortunately, the forests here were burned in the past for security reasons," said Coskun.He said the Turkish army cleared them in the search for fighters from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a rebel group that recently disarmed.Turkey's parliament this month also passed a bill that opens certain agricultural lands including olive groves to mining activities, despite widespread opposition."We could at least minimise the heat by planting trees, not by felling them," Coskun said.Electricity bills: Sweating in his kebab shop, another local, Cemil Seher, said that summers in Silopi last not three months, but five.For Seher, 51, air conditioning is no longer a luxury but a necessity."AC is essential here as much as bread and water," he said."When the air conditioners are running, the electricity bills are very high," he said, demanding authorities offer discounts for businesses."I want a discount not only for Silopi but for the entire region from here to Sanliurfa" in the east, he said."I am not making a profit because I've been working... to pay my electricity bill."Discover stories of India’s leading eco-innovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksKamala HarrisBogota AirportUS Oil ReserveTrump TariffsUPI New RulesStarlink SatelliteJulia HymanTop TrendingTravis KelceTom BradyBengaluru Boy Kidnap MurderCBSE Class 10th Sample PapersHow new nep rule worksYuzvendra Chahal DatingStephen CurryJoe BurrowBlake LivelyTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website40 jobs AI can't touch in 2025, says Microsoft Research: Is your career on the list?Former PM HD Devegowda's grandson Prajwal Revanna convicted for raping 47-year-old domestic helpIND vs ENG Live: Rain likely to play spoilsport as India eye 300; Woakes ruled outUPI new rules 2025: New NPCI changes kick in from August 1 - All you need to knowSSC exam 2025 glitches spark massive nationwide protest: Here’s why #SSCMisManagement is trending on social mediaCAT 2025 registration begins at iimcat.ac.in: Check direct link to apply online hereAP Police Constable final result 2025 released at slprb.ap.gov.in; check direct link hereIs Yuzvendra Chahal dating RJ Mahvash?

Chinese sub discovers deepest-ever creatures 10 km undersea
A Chinese submersible has discovered thousands of worms and molluscs nearly 10 kilometres (six miles) below sea level in the Mariana Trench, the deepest colony of creatures ever observed, a study revealed on Wednesday. Last year, the Chinese submersible "Fendouzhe" -- or "Striver" -- dove 23 times into the depths of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean with researchers on board, according to the study in the journal Nature.

Last year, the Chinese submersible "Fendouzhe" -- or "Striver" -- dove 23 times into the depths of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean with researchers on board, according to the study in the journal Nature. AP file photo PARIS: A Chinese submersible has discovered thousands of worms and molluscs nearly 10 kilometres (six miles) below sea level in the Mariana Trench, the deepest colony of creatures ever observed, a study revealed on Wednesday.The discovery in Earth's deepest underwater valley suggests that there could be much more life thriving in the hostile conditions at the bottom of our planet's largely unexplored oceans than previously thought, the China-led team of scientists said.Almost all life on Earth is supported by light from the Sun. However, in the total darkness at the bottom of the world, these creatures live off of chemicals such as methane seeping through cracks in the seafloor, a process called chemosynthesis.Last year, the Chinese submersible "Fendouzhe", or "Striver", dove 23 times into the depths of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean with researchers on board, according to the study in the journal Nature.They found colonies of thousands of marine tubeworms and molluscs called bivalves at depths ranging from 2,500 to 9,533 metres (8,200 to 31,000 feet) deep. Video released alongside the study showed fields of tubeworms, which grew up to 30 centimetres (12 inches) long, as well as piles of molluscs and clams. Spiky crustaceans, free-floating marine worms, sea cucumbers, feathery-armed sea lilies and other invertebrates were also recorded in the depths.The study marked "the discovery of the deepest and the most extensive chemosynthesis-based communities known to exist on Earth," its authors said.Given that other ocean trenches are similar, "such chemosynthesis-based communities might be more widespread than previously anticipated," they added.The researchers said they also found "compelling evidence" that methane was being produced by microbes, with the tubeworms tending to cluster around microbial mats that resemble snow. Previous studies have found thriving communities of single-cell organisms on the ocean floor, but few large animals.But a remotely operated vehicle discovered tubeworms and other marine invertebrates living in hydrothermal vents in the crust below the seafloor two kilometres deep in the Pacific, research said last year.Pressure rising The new study was published as nations wrangle over the contentious issue of deep-sea mining. China, the United States and others have expressed interest in mining the depths for valuable minerals.Ocean scientists warn that mining the little-explored seafloor, one of the last wild zones on the planet, could decimate fragile ecosystems that are not yet well understood.Despite recent talks, the International Seabed Authority -- which oversees deep-sea mining in international waters -- has yet to adopt long-awaited rules governing the industry. Chinese media has previously reported that the Fendouzhe submersible mission will conduct research on "deep-sea materials".Only a handful of people have ever visited the bottom of the Mariana Trench, which is a crescent-shaped depression in the Earth's crust that is deeper than Mount Everest is high.The first explorers visited the trench in 1960 on a brief expedition.But after that, there were no missions until Hollywood director James Cameron made the first solo trip to the bottom in 2012, describing a "desolate" and "alien" environment.The water pressure at the bottom of the trench is a crushing eight tons per square inch, more than a thousand times the atmospheric pressure at sea level.Discover stories of India’s leading eco-innovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksKamala HarrisBogota AirportUS Oil ReserveTrump TariffsUPI New RulesStarlink SatelliteJulia HymanTop TrendingTravis KelceTom BradyBengaluru Boy Kidnap MurderCBSE Class 10th Sample PapersHow new nep rule worksYuzvendra Chahal DatingStephen CurryJoe BurrowBlake LivelyTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteSSC exam 2025 glitches spark massive nationwide protest: Here’s why #SSCMisManagement is trending on social mediaCAT 2025 registration begins at iimcat.ac.in: Check direct link to apply online hereAP Police Constable final result 2025 released at slprb.ap.gov.in; check direct link hereIs Yuzvendra Chahal dating RJ Mahvash?

Mehar’s custom-engineered drone reached this remarkable milestone in an astonishing 0.91 seconds, a feat that not only demonstrates his technical prowess but also sets a new benchmark in the rapidly evolving world of drone technology.Mehar’s journey to this achievement has been anything but straightforward. His fascination with drones began in 8th grade, and this passion has only deepened over the years. With a keen interest in pushing technological boundaries, Mehar embarked on a months-long project to build a drone capable of unparalleled vertical acceleration.“I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of pushing the limits of what drones can do,” Mehar explained. “But breaking a world record wasn’t just about the end result; it was about the process. I wanted to prove that current technology could achieve something extraordinary, but the path to get there was filled with challenges.”The project required Mehar to design, test, and refine multiple drone prototypes. “There were moments when I felt like I was chasing an impossible dream,” Mehar recalled. “I went through countless designs, and many of them failed during testing. Some drones crashed so badly that I had no choice but to go back to the drawing board and start from scratch. Each crash was a setback, but it also sparked new ideas and innovations.”Undeterred by the setbacks, Mehar poured his energy into creating a drone that was not only fast but also aerodynamically optimized. “I spent countless hours on CAD software, meticulously designing and tweaking each component. The goal was to make the drone as streamlined as possible, which led me to shape it like a rocket. This design wasn’t just about aesthetics; it was about reducing drag and maximizing speed.”Mehar’s dedication to his craft paid off in spectacular fashion. “Every failure taught me something valuable,” he said. “It forced me to think creatively and to consider every detail, from the materials used to the weight distribution of the drone. The process was grueling, but it was also incredibly rewarding to see my ideas take flight—literally.”This record-breaking achievement is more than just a personal triumph for Mehar; it has significant implications for the future of drone technology. “The possibilities are endless,” Mehar mused. “High-speed vertical acceleration could revolutionize everything from emergency response to space exploration. This isn’t just about setting a record; it’s about opening doors to new innovations and applications.”Mehar’s groundbreaking work has already begun to inspire others in the drone community and beyond. “I hope this accomplishment encourages other young innovators to push their own boundaries,” he said. “Technology is advancing rapidly, and there’s so much potential waiting to be unlocked. I’m excited to see where we can go from here.”As Mehar looks ahead, the sky is truly the limit.

The formats mentioned above are most prominently used globally. JPGs can be different things like signatures required to sign documents or screenshots of an instruction manual. When converting JPG to PDF and then sharing it, you want to maintain the quality of the image. It also becomes highly convenient for the end-user to access the PDF file.There are a plethora of tools to convert JPG to PDF. Nonetheless, a tool that has gained a lot of trust in the segment is Adobe Acrobat. It simply converts any file from JPG to PDF without altering the quality. Moving ahead, we will step by step explain how you can use Adobe Acrobat to convert an image to PDF.Basic Definition of JPG and PDFJPG or JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, and it is mostly used for compressing highly detailed images, making them smaller for increasing their shareability.

Another highlight is that it also maintains the quality of images when the size (dimensions) is increased.Why should you convert JPG to PDF? Regarding size, JPG files take less space than PDFs. However, PDF files are easily manageable, and you can also use the other services in Adobe Document Cloud to make sharing, uploading, and managing super easy. PDF will have the upper hand over JPG because the former is easily editable. Any JPG converted to PDF can be divided into different components for editing.

Choose a plan - You can also opt for the free plan if you prefer. Apart from that, the subscription can be purchased at minimal prices. Tap on the plus button and the right bottom of the screen and then tap on the open file. Give the application storage access to get your files for editing. Select the file you want to convert. Now, you will see the 'Convert PDF' button under the image; tap on it. Your image will be successfully converted to PDF. Note: On the smartphone version, you cannot use the Image to PDF convert feature for free.Frequently asked questionsCan you convert JPG to PDF for free?Yes, there are multiple online and offline tools that can be used to convert any image to PDF without spending a single dime.How to convert JPG into editable PDF?There are not many tools available in the market that offer accurate PDF editing features such as Adobe Acrobat.

Doordarshan will telecast live the Mangala, Shringaar, Rajbhog, Sandhya, and Shayan Aartis offered to the Ram Lalla idol at the Ayodhya Ram temple on DD National, connecting devotees who can't visit the temple. National broadcaster Doordarshan has good news for Lord Ram Devotees. Doordarshan has announced that it will telecast live the morning prayers offered to the Ram Lalla idol at the Ram Temple in Ayodhya every day.Doordarshan has shared the same in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Doordarshan said that the morning aarti offered to Ram Lalla will be telecast live on DD National every morning from 6:30 am.The national broadcaster said that the decision to telecast the morning aarti live every day was taken with the aim of connecting devotees of Lord Ram, especially after the temple was inaugurated less than two months ago in a grand ceremony and everyone can't visit the temple in person. The Aarti will be telecast simultaneously on DD’s YouTube channel also.Secondly, the decision was taken because the Trust doesn’t have logistical arrangements as of now for a live broadcast. Therefore, DD will be posting a two-three-member crew on the temple premises for the coverage of the daily ritual.DD's announcement to telecast the Aarti live for 30 minutes every morning comes after getting the go-ahead from the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust for the same. Initially, DD will air the “Mangala aarti” for a few months, and then, the Ram Temple Trust will take a call on how to take it forward.6 Aartis daily at the Ayodhya Ram templeThere are 6 aartis of Ram Lalla held daily in Ayodhya Ram temple. These include Mangala Aarti at 4:30 am, Shringaar Aarti at 6:30 am, Rajbhog Aarti at 12 noon, Utthapan Aarti at 2 pm, Sandhya Aarti at 7 pm, and Shayan Aarti at 10 pm.Giving directions to devotees for Aarti, the temple trust said, "Entry for Mangala Aarti at 4 AM, Shringar Aarti at 6:15 AM, and Shayan Aarti at 10 PM is possible only with an entry pass. No entry passes required for other Aartis."Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust advisory to devoteesIn an advisory to devotees coming for darshan at the temple, the Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra said, "Devotees can enter the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir for Darshan from 6:30 AM to 9:30 PM. The entire process from entry to exit after Darshan at the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir is extremely simple and convenient. Typically, devotees can have a smooth Darshan of Prabhu Shri Ram Lalla Sarkar within 60 to 75 minutes."The temple trust advised devotees to leave their mobile phones, footwear, purses and other personal items outside the Mandir premises for their convenience and to save time.It has also asked devotees not to bring flowers, garlands, Prasad to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

The design aims to eliminate the hinge crease and reduce the device's thickness while offering added benefits and durability. However, its practicality remains uncertain. Microsoft discontinues Surface Duo smartphones but files a patent for a new foldable device with a single hinge system called 'spine cover plate'. The design aims to eliminate the hinge crease and reduce the device's thickness while offering added benefits and durability. However, its practicality remains uncertain. Microsoft did not get the success it was anticipating with its Android-powered Surface Duo-series smartphones. The company has discontinued the lineup after the Duo 2. But, this does not mean the company has stopped trying. A new patent application filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29, reveals that the company is working on another foldable or dual-display mobile device.The patent application describes the company’s take on the foldable smartphone concept with single hinge technology called “spine cover plate”.Next Microsoft smartphones could feature a Galaxy Z Fold-like designAccording to the patent application, the phone could feature a “flexible display” in a bookstyle design similar to Galaxy Z Fold decies. However, the entire focus is on the spine cover plate mechanism which is aimed at protecting the single-hinge system of the device by covering the structural element. The differentiating factor between the regular hinge and Microsoft’s design is that the spine cover adjusts automatically during the opening and closing of the phone to prevent any unnecessary gaps around the hinge to protect it from dust as well as water. Currently, Samsung’s design offers an IPX8 rating which makes their foldables water-resistant only.The patent further mentions that the new hinge mechanism could allow Microsoft to eliminate the hinge crease less visible than the current options available in the market. Moreover, Microsoft has also mentioned techniques that could allow them to reduce the overall thickness of the foldable smartphone by allowing the spine cover plate to move closer to the device’s hinge when folded. “By retracting the spine cover plate toward the central spine as the first display-supporting frame and the second display-supporting frame are rotated into a face-to-face orientation, the width of the folded computing device is reduced, thereby enabling easier and more comfortable handling of the device, such as with one hand,” Microsoft noted in the patent.Interesting idea, but practicality is a question markThe entire smartphone market is searching for a way to eliminate the foldable crease from their smartphones. Some brands have already implemented the water-drop folding mechanism to reduce it, but there’s nothing like a crease-free foldable out there. Apart from that, the durability quotient of foldable is also important considering all the movable parts these phones have. That said, adding another layer or a movable part on top of the entire foldable mechanism does not appear like a wise move despite the added benefits and durability Microsoft has explained in the patent application.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Initiatives include partnering with the Election Commission, prioritizing trusted content on YouTube, and implementing advertising policies for transparency. Measures against AI-generated content are also taken. Google has announced a series of initiatives aimed at supporting the democratic process and safeguarding its platforms from abuse during the upcoming Indian General Election. With millions of eligible voters heading to the polls, the tech giant has said that recognises its responsibility to connect users with reliable information and counter the spread of misinformation, including AI-generated content.Easy access to voting information on Search and YouTubeGoogle has mentioned that its primary focus is on providing easy access to authoritative information from trusted sources.The company has also partnered with the Election Commission of India to showcase critical details on Google Search and YouTube, such as how to register and vote, in English and Hindi. Apart from this, YouTube’s recommendation system will prioritise trusted content during the election season. Additionally, YouTube’s homepage will prominently showcase trusted content along with an “Up Next” panel to make election-related details easily available for users. YouTube will also highlight content from trusted sources during key moments through its Top News and Breaking News as well as a news watch page. Moreover, the tech giant has also set up information panels that indicate funding sources from publishers that receive public or government funding and information panels that provide topical context for topics prone to misinformation. Safeguarding misinformationTo protect the integrity of the electoral process and to protect its products and services from abuse, Google has re-inforced its existing policies to keep its products and platforms safe while curbing misinformation at the same time. Also, the policies apply to all users, irrespective of the content type. The company has employed a combination of human reviewers and artificial intelligence models to identify and remove content that violates these policies. Google's AI capabilities are enhancing its abuse-fighting efforts, enabling faster action against emerging threats.Advertising during election campaignsTo keep things transparent when it comes to election advertising, the company requires advertisers to undergo identity verification and provide necessary certifications from the Election Commission. Election ads must also include disclosures indicating the advertiser's identity and location. Google maintains a searchable hub for all election ads, providing insights into the advertisers and their spending.Restricting AI-generated contentGoogle has also taken some steps to help identify AI-generated content through new tools and policies. The company has introduced disclosure requirements for election ads containing synthetic content and will soon require creators on YouTube to label realistic altered or synthetic content. The new ad policies prohibit the use of manipulated media to mislead people, like deepfakes or doctored content.Google has also implemented restrictions to Gemini on the types of election-related queries it will respond to and has also prioritised the provision of high-quality information. Additional features, such as the "About this Image" tool in Search and digital watermarking for AI-generated images, aim to provide users with context and assess credibility.Furthermore, Google has joined the C2PA coalition, a cross-industry effort to provide transparency and context for AI-generated content. The company has confirmed the deployment of technology to counter harmful AI-generated content aimed at deceiving voters during the 2024 elections.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

TSMC's stock rallied, elevating its market capitalisation to a record, making it higher than Broadcom. Analysts expect TSMC to further advance amid surging AI-related revenue and strong pricing power.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has reclaimed a spot in the list of the world’s 10 most valuable companies, riding the optimism of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom in the tech industry that pushed its stock to record levels.According to a report by Bloomberg, TSMC’s stock rallied 14% last week, elevating the chipmaker’s market capitalisation to a record, before a 2% decline in early trading on Monday (March 11), pared it to $634 billion. However, the decline didn’t impact the company much as it still has a market share higher than that of Broadcom, the report noted.What analysts have to sayAnalysts from Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. expect the semiconductor giant – that has Apple, Nvidia and Qualcomm as its customers – to advance further amid surging AI-related revenue and strong pricing power. “Generative AI semi is an obvious growth driver for TSMC,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Charlie Chan wrote in a note last week. The company’s overseas expansion also helps mitigate geopolitical concerns, they said.TSMC’s revenue gained 9.4% in the first two months of 2024 as demand for high-end chips increased due to a wave of activity in AI.Nvidia gets ‘AI boost’This is not the first time this year that a chip company has seen its stock on an upward spiral. This year, Nvidia was among the companies that got a boost by a frenzy around generative AI.In the last month, Nvidia stock price has risen over 20% while in the last six months, it has risen over 90%. Moreover, in the last one year, Nvidia stock price has appreciated from $234.36 per share level to $875.28 per share mark – registering a 275% jump.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

The update combines gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer data, reducing magnetic interference and benefiting Google Maps and third-party apps on Android 5.0 or above. Google Maps is updating its Fused Orientation Provider (FOP) API to improve direction accuracy in busy areas. The update combines gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer data, reducing magnetic interference and benefiting Google Maps and third-party apps on Android 5.0 or above. We keep hearing about Google Maps fiasco from across the globe where it directed people in some odd direction and eventually got them stuck in a ‘worst case scenario’. Now a new post published on the Android Developers blog gives an insight about Maps getting a new update to better with directions. The post talks about a potential upgrade that Maps will be getting with the Fused Orientation Provider (FOP) API that aims to make the ‘orientation’ detection better on Android devices, irrespective of the hardware used by different OEMs on their devices. According to the post, the update will make Maps interpret the directions better to make it more accurate by combining the gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer data. However, this idea of Google using data from all the sensors isn’t new, the company has used the API before, but the update will make better magnetic interference. As per the post, the changes will not only apply to Google Maps but also third-party apps that rely on Google Maps to offer navigational data. It is to be noted that the update will be done with internals of the Google Maps, it won’t affect the user interface or the layout of the app. Also, the updated API will be rolled out from the server side or via the app update in Android devices running Android 5.0 or above. How it will affect usersAs mentioned, the update won’t change anything in terms of the app’s design or user interface. The changes are internal in the form of API which will be pushed automatically via the update. That said, the update is set to make it better with directions, especially in busy areas.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Musk announces xAI open sourcing Grok chatbot. OpenAI CEO Altman takes a dig at Musk's chatbot. Musk, obviously didn't like the jab and replied with a long-ish message saying “GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.”  Elon Musk has been extremely critical of ChatGPT maker OpenAI for deviating from its mission to develop AI for the benefit of humanity and taking a profit-making path. He has advocated that artificial intelligence (AI) should be accessible for all, and he has now announced that his AI startup xAI will open source Grok chatbot this week.“This week, @xAI will open source Grok,” Musk said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).In simpler words, open-sourcing a software, like a chatbot, means that the software projects are redistributable as all source code is accessible by everyone. One of the advantages of having open source software is that it provides flexibility to an enterprise to have multiple ways of fixing a problem rather than waiting for an internal team to provide a solution.“OpenAI is a lie”Meanwhile, a user suggested that OpenAI should do the same.“OpenAI should do the same if they are ‘open’ that is,” the user said. Musk replied, “OpenAI is a lie.”Musk wants AI technology to be open-source Musk had floated the idea of open-sourcing AI during a podcast in November last year. In a podcast with Lex Fridman, Musk suggested that he likes the idea of open-source AI. “I am generally in favour of open sourcing, like biassed towards open sourcing,” he said.His comments came soon after his AI company called xAI released Grok, its chatbot, which reportedly took four months to build. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was quick to take a dig at this and shared a post in which he built Grok with a single prompt on GPT Builder."GPTs can save a lot of effort:” he said.Musk, obviously didn't like the jab and replied with a long-ish message saying “GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.” About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Ruby Johnson filed a lawsuit against Detective Gary Staab and Sgt. Gregory Buschy.  Apple's Find My app has cost the city of Denver, US $3.76 million in compensation and damages. In 2022, the city’s police wrongly raided and ransacked an elderly woman's home looking for a stolen truck and guns. According to a report by CNN, Denver police were seeking to recover a stolen truck loaded with guns, ammo and cash. For this, the police used Apple's Find My technology on another iPhone to locate the vehicle.However, the police picked the wrong house out of a fairly wide area to storm in and catch the thieves. Due to this misplaced raid, 78-year-old Ruby Johnson filed a lawsuit against the police. As compensation, the city will be paying Johnson a $3.76 million award. Moreover, the defendant officers — Detective Gary Staab and Sgt. Gregory Buschy — were also sued as an individual. Denver police had previously cleared both men of wrongdoing, but the jury disagreed.How Apple’s Find My app played a roleThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) brought the case on behalf of Johnson. The lawsuit mentioned that the raid was conducted based on an “alleged location ping from an iPhone's Find My app that the officers did not understand and for which they had no training." As per the complaint, the police relied on a "Find My" ping from an iPhone 11 that was probably still in the stolen truck. However, the area identified included parts of six other properties across parts of four city blocks.In a statement, Johnson's attorney Tim Macdonald said: “We are disturbed by the lack of training or policy changes and hope that the amount of the punitive damages award will send a strong message that the police department must take seriously the constitutional rights of its residents.” The ACLU and the jury concluded that the two police officers who ordered the raid had no reason to single out Johnson's house as the target. Also, the officers have to pay nearly $1.25 million each in punitive and compensatory damages. A Denver District Court clerk noted that the city has not yet filed an appeal of the verdict.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

A bill to sell TikTok is introduced, backed by President Biden. Kotick discussed acquisition with OpenAI head. Activision Blizzard faced a lawsuit. Concerns about data privacy and ties to China persist. TikTok urges American users to support it.  Bobby Kotick, the former head of Activision Blizzard, is reportedly considering buying TikTok, as the app could be banned in the United States. The Wall Street Journal reports that Kotick has talked to ByteDance, the company that owns TikTok, about buying the app, which could cost hundreds of billions of dollars.This comes as US lawmakers introduce a new bill that would make ByteDance sell TikTok within six months or stop it from being available in US app stores.President Joe Biden has said he would approve the bill if it passes in Congress.The Wall Street Journal report adds that Kotick, the head of OpenAI, Sam Altman, discussed teaming up to buy TikTok at a dinner last week. Kotick's interest in TikTok follows a rough end to his 30 years leading Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft acquired last year. The company faced a lawsuit saying it allowed sexual harassment and discrimination under Kotick's leadership. The Wall Street Journal also said Kotick knew about bad behaviour and didn't tell the board everything. Kotick was accused of harassment, but Activision Blizzard said the report was "misleading."Lawmakers are worried about data privacy and TikTok's ties to China. US President Biden, whose administration has banned the app already on state devices, has expressed his support for banning the app in the US. However, former President Donald Trump, who once wanted to ban TikTok, has changed his mind, saying a ban would help TikTok's rivals, like Facebook and YouTube. As the bill against TikTok gains support, the app has asked its American users to speak up for it, sending messages telling users to call their representatives. The bill, which passed a committee last week, is expected to be approved when the House votes on Wednesday. If it passes, it will then go to the Senate, and then the bill will be signed by the President of the US.Former Activision boss reportedly wants to buy TikTokAbout the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Reason is said to be delay in the delivery of two supercomputers by the French company to Indian weather forecasting institutes. According to a report in news agency PTI, the Earth Sciences Ministry had ordered two supercomputers worth $100 million from French firm Eviden, of the Atos Group, last year to enhance the computing capabilities of its institutions -- the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM)."I am more upset because the target we set was December. The Union Cabinet had already approved purchasing the supercomputer. We have only four petaflop capacity. We want to install up to 18 petaflop capacity," Rijiju told PTI in a video interview.He said that the French company ran into some financial trouble and wanted the government to make payment to its subsidiary.Minister says that the delay is causing him "worry"Rijiju said that the delay has caused him lots of worry as the company has overshot the timeline. "But I think we will sort it out soon," he said, adding that the government wanted to be "very correct in our position legally"."We are ready to release the money because we want the machine immediately. The only problem is the amount is not small. So if we pay now, if the company is bankrupt or something happens, who will bail out," the minister said.Rijiju further added that the government was taking some steps to speed up the delivery of the supercomputer but did not elaborate. "But I hope the French government will also intervene because we have a good understanding and a very good relationship with the French government."Since it is a high-cost equipment, we want to ensure that the transaction happens duly and properly," he said."From outside, everything's ready. It is only the problem with the main company. They want us to pay their subsidiary. We will pay only to a company whom we have entered an MoU with," Rijiju said.The supercomputing system, based on Eviden's BullSequana XH2000, is said to have a combined power capacity of up to 21.3 petaflops.Supercomputer at IITMThe supercomputer at the Pune-based IITM will provide 13 petaflops of computing power for atmosphere and climate research. As per the PTI report, it will integrate 3,000 CPU nodes using AMD EPYC 7643 processors and 26 GPU nodes through NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs.

Jabbar has directed senior faculty and department heads not to issue public statements without approval, warning of disciplinary action for media or social media criticism. The move follows remarks by doctors Mohandas and Harris Chirakkal on stalled cadaver organ transplantation and policy lapses, sparking debate over transparency and academic freedom.  Thiruvananthapuram, India: The Principal of Thiruvananthapuram Medical College, Dr. P.K. Jabbar, has issued a directive prohibiting department heads and senior faculty from making public statements without prior approval.The decision was formally conveyed during a meeting of department heads, following controversies triggered by remarks from two senior doctors, Dr. Mohandas and Dr. Harris Chirakkal.According to the directive, any grievances, concerns, or criticisms must be routed through official channels and communicated to higher authorities within the medical education department. Direct remarks in the media, on social media, or in public forums could invite disciplinary action.The move comes after strong criticism by former Head of Nephrology, Dr. Mohandas, who alleged that there had been “absolutely no progress” in cadaver organ transplantation since 2017. His remarks, accompanied by a social media post with photos of deceased former department heads, drew wide attention before being deleted. A memo was later served on him.Similarly, Dr. Harris Chirakkal stated that despite repeatedly flagging concerns through official channels, inaction by authorities compelled him to go public, further fuelling debate over transparency in the medical education sector.Against this backdrop, the Principal warned all department heads not to repeat such actions, stressing that while internal complaints and suggestions are welcome, public criticism of government policies or institutional matters will not be tolerated.The directive, aimed at maintaining discipline in the institution, has also sparked discussions within the medical fraternity on whether restricting public expression could suppress genuine concerns about healthcare policy and patient welfare.

He said the course was inaugurated by Deputy Chief Minister Pravati Parida on August 18. “Most of the enrolled students are anganwadi workers or play school teachers. Under the New Education Policy, this is our step towards promoting education in the mother tongue. We are translating as many course materials in Odia as we can. Our intention is to make higher education more accessible,” Suraj told reporters. He informed that the state government had signed an MoU with IGNOU on June 9, under which the translation of the course material into Odia was to be completed within 100 days. “On June 9, we signed an MoU with IGNOU under which the process of translating the course material in Odia was to be completed in under 100 days.

IGNOU Vice Chancellor Uma Kanjilal said the introduction of the diploma course in Odia was the first step to make study material available in the language and overcome the language barrier. “This is our first step in making the course material available in the mother tongue. This will help us overcome the language barrier and is aligned with the NEP 2020. Within two to three months, other major programmes will also be translated into Odia. We plan to translate all the programmes within two years. Next will be undergraduate programmes, followed by postgraduate programmes,” Kanjilal said. The Odia course material and textbooks for the DECE were formally released on Monday by Deputy CM Pravati Parida and Higher Education Minister Suryabanshi Suraj.

Previously, IGNOU offered the DECE in English, Hindi and Tamil. With this launch, Odia has also been added. The DECE is a one-year diploma course, open to students after completion of +2. It focuses on early childhood education, child health and nutrition. Students will be provided with textbooks, audio cassettes, and video tutorials.

The board has not yet confirmed whether it will release the answer key or directly announce the final results.Cut-offs likely to rise as exam seen as easierAccording to candidates, the NEET PG 2025 exam was of easy to moderate difficulty, which may lead to an increase in the qualifying cut-offs.

Last year, the NEET PG results were declared on August 23.Supreme Court directives on NEET PG counsellingFollowing several petitions, the Supreme Court issued ten directives to ensure transparency in the NEET PG counselling process. These include a synchronised counselling schedule for MCC All India Quota and state counselling, Aadhaar-based seat tracking, publication of answer keys and raw scores, and penalties for seat blocking.Private and deemed universities are required to disclose their fee structures. A centralised fee regulation mechanism will be supervised by the National Medical Commission (NMC), and state authorities will be held accountable for any rule violations.

The halt follows disputes over OBC reservations and High Court interventions. The revised provisional merit list had been released, but round 1 seat allotment scheduled for August 20 is cancelled. Students and political leaders demand clarity on the next steps.  The West Bengal Medical Counselling Committee (WBMCC) has announced that the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test Undergraduate (NEET UG) 2025 counselling for MBBS and BDS courses has been suspended with immediate effect. The official notice, issued on Monday, stated that the process will remain “in abeyance until further orders.”The decision was made just a day after the revised provisional merit list for 85% state quota seats was released. A total of 11,178 candidates listed in the West Bengal NEET UG provisional merit list are now left uncertain about their admissions as the round 1 seat allotment, which was scheduled for August 20, stands cancelled.High Court intervention and revised scheduleEarlier, the Calcutta High Court had directed a halt to the state’s admission and recruitment procedures citing disputes over Other Backward Classes (OBC) reservation. The court later permitted the process to resume, instructing the West Bengal Joint Entrance Examinations Board (WBJEEB) to issue a fresh merit list by August 22. Following this directive, WBMCC published a revised merit list on August 16 and had set the round 1 seat allotment results for release on August 20 after 4 pm, with reporting between August 21 and 23.However, the new notification issued by WBMCC on Monday read:“The WB NEET UG Medical Dental 2025 Counseling/Admission process has been kept in abeyance till further order. All concerned are hereby informed accordingly.”Political reaction and student concernsThe sudden suspension has drawn sharp criticism. Union Minister of State for Education and Development of the North Eastern Region, Sukanta Majumdar, accused the state government of acting without justification. In a post on X, he wrote:“In the name of an ‘Urgent Notice,’ the West Bengal government has indefinitely suspended the WB NEET UG Medical Dental Counselling and Admission process without giving any proper reason. The future of the state’s medical students has been pushed into darkness.”He further questioned the intent behind the move: “Why was the admission counselling, once started, suddenly halted indefinitely? Is this yet another attempt to appease narrow political interests by granting undue privilege to a particular group under the guise of reservation?”With the admissions on hold, medical aspirants in the state are once again left in limbo, awaiting clarity on the next steps from the authorities.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

Stanford chooses legacy admissions over state funding: Here's why wealthy connections still trump California's ban
Stanford University will no longer accept California's state-funded student aid, allowing it to maintain legacy and donor-based admissions despite a new state law targeting such practices. The university will replace the aid with its own funds, avoiding new disclosure requirements. The law, effective September 1, stops short of penalising non-compliant institutions financially. Stanford assures that students' aid will remain unaffected, and generous internal scholarships will continue for low- and middle-income families.

The university will replace the aid with its own funds, avoiding new disclosure requirements. The law, effective September 1, stops short of penalising non-compliant institutions financially. Stanford assures that students' aid will remain unaffected, and generous internal scholarships will continue for low- and middle-income families. Legacy admissions continue at Stanford as university opts out of state funding. (AI Image) Stanford University has announced it will no longer participate in California's state-funded student aid programmes in order to maintain its practice of considering legacy and donor connections during undergraduate admissions. The move allows the university to bypass a new state law aimed at limiting the influence of alumni and donor ties in admissions decisions.The law, which takes effect on September 1, restricts private nonprofit colleges that receive state-funded student aid from using legacy or donor status as a factor in admissions. Institutions that continue the practice while accepting such aid are required to publicly disclose detailed admissions data. Stanford's decision ensures it avoids these reporting requirements and associated public scrutiny.Stanford confirms continuation of legacy and donor admissionsStanford stated it will continue to factor in applicants' ties to alumni and donors when selecting its undergraduate class for autumn 2026, according to reporting by Higher Ed Dive. The university explained that its withdrawal from state-funded aid is "in order to comply with recent California legislation." Stanford will instead use its own institutional scholarship funds to replace the state aid.As per institutional data cited by Higher Ed Dive, 13.6% of Stanford's admitted undergraduate class in autumn 2023 had donor or alumni connections. That year, the university's overall undergraduate acceptance rate stood at just under 4%.California law limits but does not prohibit legacy admissionsThe legislation, signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom, was originally introduced by former California Assemblymember Phil Ting following the US Supreme Court's 2023 ruling that ended race-conscious admissions. Ting's proposal initially aimed to impose financial penalties by cutting access to the Cal Grant — a state financial aid programme for students from low- and middle-income families — for institutions that continued legacy and donor admissions.However, as Higher Ed Dive reported, the final version of the law did not include financial penalties. Instead, it requires schools to disclose demographic and admissions data for applicants with and without legacy or donor ties. It also allows the California Department of Justice to publish a list of noncompliant institutions on its website, implementing a name-and-shame approach rather than direct funding cuts.Stanford students will not see financial aid reductionStanford confirmed that current and incoming students who were receiving aid from state programmes will not experience a decrease in financial assistance. "Students do not need to take any action," the university stated in a press release issued on July 29, as reported by Higher Ed Dive.Stanford continues to offer significant internal aid. Students from families earning below $100,000 annually pay no tuition, room, or board, while those from households making under $150,000 are exempt from tuition fees.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

For professionals, AI fluency drives career growth and adaptability, while for students, it builds confidence and future readiness. Embracing AI as a collaborator, with ethics in mind, is now essential for career survival.  In early 2023, IgniteTech CEO Eric Vaughan made a move that shook the tech world. He laid off nearly 80% of his workforce. The reason? Widespread resistance to adopting artificial intelligence (AI). Vaughan had introduced “AI Mondays,” a weekly day dedicated entirely to AI projects. But when employees, especially the technical teams, pushed back, he chose replacement over persuasion. Looking back, Vaughan described the decision as “extremely difficult,” yet he said he would do it again, according to the Fortune.For students and professionals navigating today’s workplace, this isn’t just a headline — it’s a wake-up call. AI literacy is no longer optional. It’s a skill that can shape careers, open doors, and, in some cases, determine whether you keep your job.Why AI literacy mattersAI literacy isn’t just about learning a new software or tool. It’s about understanding how AI works, its strengths and limitations, and the broader ethical questions it raises. It’s about knowing how to use AI to solve real-world problems, not just following instructions.When you build AI literacy, you approach technology with curiosity rather than fear. You see opportunities instead of obstacles. And in a world where AI is becoming central to almost every industry, that mindset is everything.For professionals: Staying ahead of the curveFor those already in the workforce, AI literacy can be a career game-changer. It allows you to integrate AI into your workflows, make faster decisions, and find creative solutions to problems. Those who resist risk being left behind, overtaken by colleagues or competitors who are comfortable leveraging AI to their advantage.But AI literacy isn’t just a technical skill. It sharpens your ability to think critically, make ethical choices, and solve complex problems creatively. Professionals who master AI aren’t just workers, they become indispensable contributors in a tech-driven world.For students: Preparing for the futureFor students stepping into the workforce, the stakes are just as high. Early exposure to AI, whether through projects, coursework, or personal experimentation, can give you an edge in a competitive job market. Understanding AI helps you meet the expectations of future employers and shows that you’re adaptable, curious, and proactive.Students who embrace AI as a collaborator, rather than a threat, also gain confidence in problem-solving and innovation. Learning to work with AI early sets the stage for creative thinking and equips you to navigate challenges in professional settings with ease.How to navigate the AI landscapeLearning AI isn’t just about tools or coding, it’s a mindset. It’s about seeing AI as something that can augment human capabilities, not replace them. The more you engage with AI, experiment, and reflect on its outcomes, the better you understand its potential, and its limits.Ethics also matter. Knowing the societal impact of AI ensures that you use it responsibly, balancing innovation with accountability. In other words, AI literacy isn’t just a career skill — it’s a professional responsibility.The story of IgniteTech’s workforce overhaul is a stark reminder: in a world shaped by AI, failing to adapt is risky. For students entering the job market and professionals looking to stay relevant, investing time in AI literacy isn’t just smart, it’s essential.When you embrace AI, you don’t just keep pace — you gain the tools to navigate complexity, enhance your work, and contribute to a future where technology works for people, not the other way around.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

Education department delays put parenting college students in a bind: Here's why child care funding matters more than ever
Delays by the US Department of Education in renewing federal child care funding are putting parenting college students in a difficult position. The CCAMPIS grant, which supports campus-based child care services, faces uncertainty after funding applications were postponed. Students with young children at risk of losing vital childcare support say this threatens their education. Some colleges are scrambling to find alternative solutions as these delays continue under President Trump's administration.

Some colleges are scrambling to find alternative solutions as these delays continue under President Trump's administration. Federal childcare funding delays threaten parenting students: What you need to know about CCAMPIS grant. (Getty Images) Parenting college students across the US are facing significant challenges due to delays in federal child care funding, jeopardising their ability to continue their education. The US Department of Education has postponed grant applications for several federal programmes, including the Child Care Access Means Parents in School (CCAMPIS) grant, which provides crucial support to student parents.The CCAMPIS grant, established by Congress in 1998, offers millions of dollars to colleges to fund campus-based child care services. This includes staff salaries, before- and after-school programmes, subsidies, and advising to help students with young children stay in school. However, delays in renewing this funding threaten to leave many parenting students without child care support early in the new academic year.Federal funding delays threaten vital child care supportThe CCAMPIS grant distributed over $83 million to hundreds of colleges in fiscal year 2023, with the average award exceeding $317,000 per institution, according to federal data cited by USA Today. This funding plays a key role in helping approximately one in five undergraduate students, who have children, complete their degrees.Carmina Garcia, a nursing student at Pima Community College in Arizona and mother of three young children, told USA Today, "I don't know how I could've done it any other way. If I wouldn't have found this, I don't think that I would be pursuing the education that I'm pursuing." Yet, her college has warned that the child care programme will end on September 30 due to funding delays.Similarly, Mahogany-Ann Fowler, an architecture student at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, faces uncertainty as her college's CCAMPIS funding is also set to expire on the same date. IUP spokesperson Michelle Fryling confirmed to USA Today that the university is "unsure of any personnel changes related to the end of this grant."Education Department cuts and grant delays cause confusionThe delays come after the US Department of Education halved its workforce in March under President Trump's administration. Typically, CCAMPIS renewal applications open in late May and close by July. However, the Education Department did not open applications this year, leaving students and colleges in limbo.James Hermes, associate vice president of government relations at the American Association of Community Colleges, told USA Today, "We're still very much on the edge of our seats." Experts suggest the delay could be due to staffing shortages or possible attempts to reduce funding, as President Trump's budget proposal suggested eliminating CCAMPIS funding altogether.Eddy Conroy, senior policy manager at New America, was quoted by USA Today questioning whether this is "a capacity issue" or "a backdoor way to illegally impound funds that have been appropriated."Students scramble for alternatives as support disappearsHannah Fuller, a 22-year-old student at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and a three-year CCAMPIS recipient, said her college is encouraging her to apply for state childcare programmes. Fuller told USA Today, "He would never see me," referring to her 4-year-old son, if she had to take on extra work to cover childcare.One college, Mount Wachusett Community College in Massachusetts, has taken proactive steps. Ann Reynolds, the CCAMPIS adviser, secured $94,000 from the college foundation to cover two years of childcare support, ensuring current students remain supported even if federal funds are delayed, as reported by USA Today.The ongoing delays in federal child care funding are creating considerable uncertainty for parenting college students nationwide, raising concerns about their ability to continue their education without this essential support.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill’: How students are rethinking their paths in higher education
President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed July 4, 2025, reshapes federal student loans by capping graduate borrowing, eliminating Grad PLUS loans, and altering repayment plans. A U.S. News survey shows over 60% of students expect personal impact, with many reconsidering degrees, course loads, or financing paths. Rising stress highlights the law’s sweeping effect on higher education.

A U.S. News survey shows over 60% of students expect personal impact, with many reconsidering degrees, course loads, or financing paths. Rising stress highlights the law’s sweeping effect on higher education.  When President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law on July 4, 2025, it promised to reshape the landscape of federal student loans. The law will introduce borrowing caps for graduate, medical, and law students, eliminate Grad PLUS loans, which previously allowed graduate students to borrow beyond federal limits, and fundamentally change income-driven repayment plans, which tie monthly payments to a borrower’s income.For many students, these changes are more than numbers on a page, they are decisions that will shape their academic journeys and financial futures. According to a survey by U.S. News of 1,190 college students conducted between July 31 and August 4, over a third (35%) are considering reducing their course load, while 32% are contemplating switching degrees.Most students anticipate personal impactThe survey suggests that the new law is not just theoretical. More than 60% of students say they expect to be personally affected, compared with 20% who say they will not, and 19% who are unsure, according to U.S. News. The changes that concern students most include the elimination of certain repayment options, such as the Biden-era SAVE Plan — a program that previously allowed borrowers to cap payments at a percentage of income while forgiving remaining debt after a set period. About a third of respondents (32%) cited this as a major concern.These numbers show that a majority of students are already feeling the potential financial squeeze and may need to rethink their borrowing strategies and budget planning.Understanding remains limitedDespite the law’s significance, many students remain unclear about its details. Only 20% of respondents said they fully understand how the law will affect them, while 19% admitted they do not understand it at all. Another 39% understand the changes partially, and 22% are unsure about the implications, according to U.S. News.Graduate and professional students — including those in medical and law programs — are more likely to pay attention to these changes, since the elimination of Grad PLUS loans and the new borrowing caps directly affect the amount they can borrow for tuition and living expenses.The data highlights the knowledge gap among students, indicating that many may make critical academic or financial decisions without full clarity.Opposition to the law is widespreadThe survey also highlights strong resistance among students. More than half (51%) said they do not support any of the changes. Approval for specific measures is limited, with about one-fifth supporting borrowing caps for graduate school, medical or law school programs, or the elimination of certain income-driven repayment plans, according to U.S. News.Student skepticism points to concerns over limited flexibility and the potential constraints on educational opportunities.Students reconsidering academic plansFor many, the financial constraints are forcing a reassessment of academic priorities. About 35% of students say they are considering reducing their course load, while 32% are weighing switching degrees. Others are exploring international study options (31%) or even military service (26%) to help finance their education. Among first-generation college students — those whose parents did not attend college — these figures rise to 45% for cutting back and 44% for switching majors, according to U.S. News.Student responses reveal the real pressure of financial changes on life decisions, as some reconsider long-term ambitions or make significant adjustments to their educational paths.Student voices illustrate the weight of these decisions. “I’m thinking about not finishing law school,” one student shared. Another, who had hoped to pursue medical school, admitted bluntly, “Honestly, I’m cooked,” according to U.S. News.Stress levels are risingThe new law is also affecting student well-being. Those who previously felt “extremely” stressed about paying for college accounted for 24%. That number has now climbed to 31% with the introduction of the Big Beautiful Bill, according to U.S. News.This increase in stress reflects the immediate pressure students face in balancing finances with academic goals, showing the human impact of policy changes.A policy reshaping higher education pathsThe Big Beautiful Bill is more than a legislative change, it is shaping how students plan their academic futures. With borrowing limits tightening and certain repayment programs eliminated, students are forced to recalibrate priorities, weigh new options, and, in some cases, rethink the very degrees they had planned to pursue.The coming months will reveal the full impact of the law, but for now, students across the country are facing a period of uncertainty, reflection, and careful planning — highlighting just how directly federal policy can influence personal educational journeys.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

US students banned from posting about sorority rush as RushTok on TikTok turns toxic: Here's why Greek life is going offline
US universities, especially the University of Alabama, are discouraging students from posting on TikTok during sorority recruitment due to rising online backlash. RushTok, which popularised the process online, has exposed participants to criticism and mental health stress. Some sororities have informally banned prospects from media interaction. Despite potential earnings and exposure, students now face pressure to remain offline during rush. Financial costs, emotional strain, and concerns over social media’s influence have driven this shift.

Despite potential earnings and exposure, students now face pressure to remain offline during rush. Financial costs, emotional strain, and concerns over social media’s influence have driven this shift. Sisters Kylan Darnell, 21, left, and Izzy Darnell, 19, pose for a photo on Aug. 14, 2025, in Tuscaloosa, Ala. (AP Photo) Sororities across the US are implementing strict social media bans during recruitment week, marking a significant shift from the viral TikTok phenomenon that once celebrated Greek life culture. Sororities are exclusive women's social organisations at American universities, typically founded on principles of sisterhood, academic achievement and community service, with membership considered a privilege that students must earn through a competitive selection process.The move comes after several high-profile cases where students faced severe online harassment following their participation in "RushTok" content. Kylan Darnell, who became an overnight celebrity through her University of Alabama sorority content four years ago, has stepped back from social media after experiencing mental health impacts from negative reactions to her posts, as reported by the Associated Press. The 21-year-old rising senior, who was a member of Zeta Tau Alpha, previously embodied the RushTok movement that documented the week-long recruitment process.Sororities cite harassment concernsMany sororities have issued de facto bans against speaking to press or posting on social media during rush week at Alabama, which hosts the nation's largest on-campus Greek life with nearly 13,000 participating students, according to the Associated Press. The measures are designed to protect prospects from harassment that has become increasingly common as the recruitment process, known as "rush," involves students trying out for sororities through rounds of activities with strict dress codes and etiquette requirements.Financial pressures of recruitmentThe recruitment process carries substantial financial commitments for participants. This week's 2,600 recruits each paid $550 to participate in a non-refundable fee structure, as reported by the Associated Press. Accepted members face average costs of $8,400 per semester to live in sorority houses, or $4,100 if residing elsewhere, according to the Alabama Panhellenic Association.Students often spend tens of thousands on outfits, makeup and travel expenses before even beginning the process. An entire consulting industry has emerged, with some services charging up to $10,000 for months of guidance beginning in high school, as students submit "social resumes" and letters of recommendation from sorority alumni.Social media influence and consequencesMorgan Cadenhead, now 20, gained such a following through RushTok despite being dropped that she covered most of her tuition through social media income, the Associated Press reported. However, she faced significant online criticism for her comments about Greek life and now seeks offline employment opportunities. The marketing major was featured on Lifetime's "Sorority Mom's Guide to Rush!" programme.Lorie Stefaneli, a New York City-based consultant who works with students nationwide, told the Associated Press she serves as "literally a therapist" during rush week, taking calls at all hours. "I'm talking these girls down from a ledge," she said, as reported by the Associated Press.Strict posting policies implementedMultiple incoming freshmen confirmed to the Associated Press that they were explicitly prohibited from media interviews or rush-related social media posts. Darnell noted that selective "Old Row" houses automatically drop prospects who post content during recruitment."Now a lot of girls just come to the university to be influencers," Darnell told the Associated Press. "It kind of gets in the way of sisterhood."Some students, including Darnell's 19-year-old sister Izzy, continue posting despite restrictions, generating millions of views within days whilst satisfying demand for content about the traditionally secretive process.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

Boston colleges brace as visa delays leave international students waiting
Visa backlogs are disrupting Boston’s academic and housing cycles, leaving apartments in Allston and Mission Hill vacant and international students in limbo. Landlords hesitate to rent without confirmed visas, while universities like Northeastern prepare with remote and overseas options. With forecasts of a 40% enrollment drop, the delays threaten students’ ambitions and Boston’s education-driven economy.

Landlords hesitate to rent without confirmed visas, while universities like Northeastern prepare with remote and overseas options. With forecasts of a 40% enrollment drop, the delays threaten students’ ambitions and Boston’s education-driven economy.  “Most apartment owners are like, ‘I can’t take the risk,’” says Boston realtor Terry Leung, according to WBUR. His remark points to a challenge much larger than Boston’s housing market — the growing uncertainty international students face as visa approvals slow down.Every fall, Boston braces for a new academic year with thousands of international students arriving to fill classrooms and apartments. But this year, visa backlogs have disrupted that rhythm. Students who have secured admission offers and even arranged housing are unable to move forward without an approved visa. Many landlords, as Leung explained, refuse to consider applications until visas are confirmed, leaving apartments in student-heavy neighborhoods like Allston and Mission Hill unexpectedly vacant well into the summer.Beyond Boston’s rental marketThe housing slowdown is only a symptom of the deeper issue. According to WBUR, international students are encountering longer waits for visa consultations and interview appointments. The Trump administration’s policies, including the addition of social media screenings in June, have made the process more time-consuming and unpredictable. For students, the uncertainty is not just logistical; it is emotional. Until visas are issued, they cannot book flights, confirm housing, or begin the transition to their new academic lives.While the broader Boston rental market had a normal leasing season, neighborhoods reliant on international student renters lagged sharply behind.The cost of waitingThe stakes are far higher than housing. International students are integral to the U.S. higher education system and its economy. Last year, they contributed $43 billion to the national economy through tuition, housing, food, and transportation, according to the Association of International Educators. “This is going to have a big ripple effect on local and state economies,” Sarah Spreitzer of the American Council on Education told WBUR.Universities in Boston are already preparing for disruption. Northeastern, where nearly two-thirds of graduate students are international, has offered options like remote learning, deferrals, and enrollment at its London and Canada campuses, WBUR noted. Other institutions are exploring similar contingency plans to ensure students don’t lose an academic year because of visa delays.Looking aheadThe Association of International Educators predicts up to a 40% drop in new international student enrollment this fall. For Boston, a city whose academic ecosystem is deeply tied to global student mobility, the implications are sobering.“I think all of our institutions are planning for a very real possibility of having fewer international students here in the United States come fall of 2025,” Spreitzer told WBUR.For students still waiting for visa appointments, the uncertainty is more than a policy issue, it is a pause on their ambitions. And for Boston, the empty apartments in Mission Hill and Allston stand as a visible reminder of how delays at embassies can ripple through universities, neighborhoods, and economies.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

Oklahoma requires teachers from California and New York to pass conservative loyalty test: Here's why critics call it 'MAGA indoctrination'
Oklahoma will require teachers from California and New York to pass a PragerU-administered exam aimed at preventing “radical leftist ideology” in classrooms. The test has drawn criticism from teachers’ unions and politicians, who label it a "MAGA loyalty test" and political posturing amid a teacher shortage. The assessment focuses on conservative principles and is set to become a mandatory part of teacher certification in the state, as reported by the Associated Press.

The test has drawn criticism from teachers’ unions and politicians, who label it a "MAGA loyalty test" and political posturing amid a teacher shortage. The assessment focuses on conservative principles and is set to become a mandatory part of teacher certification in the state, as reported by the Associated Press. Oklahoma’s new PragerU teacher exam sparks criticism over ‘MAGA loyalty test’ claims. (AI Image) Oklahoma will require teachers applying from California and New York to pass a new assessment designed to prevent the spread of what state officials describe as "radical leftist ideology." The Republican-controlled state’s education department announced that prospective teachers from these two blue states must clear a certification exam before gaining permission to teach in Oklahoma schools.The exam, administered by PragerU, a conservative nonprofit based in Oklahoma, forms part of the state’s effort to control the political content taught in classrooms. Opponents of the measure, however, have labelled the test a "MAGA loyalty test" aimed at imposing partisan viewpoints on educators, according to the Associated Press.What the test involves and who administers itRyan Walters, Oklahoma’s superintendent of public schools, stated on Monday that "as long as I am superintendent, Oklahoma classrooms will be safeguarded from the radical leftist ideology fostered in places like California and New York," as reported by the Associated Press. The test was developed in partnership with PragerU, an organisation known for producing short videos promoting conservative perspectives on politics and economics.The state has not publicly released the entire 50-question exam, but the Associated Press obtained the first five questions. These include inquiries about the first three words of the US Constitution and the importance of freedom of religion to America’s identity. Marissa Streit, CEO of PragerU, told CNN that several questions aim to address "undoing the damage of gender ideology," as quoted by the Associated Press.PragerU's role institutionalised in OklahomaQuinton Hitchcock, spokesperson for Oklahoma’s education department, said the assessment will be introduced "very soon." Experts note this marks a significant shift, with PragerU moving from an optional educational resource to an institutionalised gatekeeper for teacher certification in the state.Jonathan Zimmerman, a history of education professor at the University of Pennsylvania, called the move a "watershed moment," explaining that PragerU’s involvement in certification represents a formal endorsement of its materials. He noted that many teachers rely on online resources rather than textbooks for instruction, with PragerU now playing an official role in that process, as reported by the Associated Press.Criticism from teachers’ unions and politiciansThe American Federation of Teachers (AFT), one of the largest teachers’ unions in the US, criticised the requirement. AFT President Randi Weingarten described it as a "MAGA loyalty test" that would deter teachers in a state already facing a significant shortage, according to the Associated Press.State Democratic Party chairman John Waldron condemned the policy as "political posturing." Waldron, who moved from New Jersey to Oklahoma to teach social studies, said such tests would signal the state’s lack of seriousness in attracting quality educators and called it "a textbook definition of indoctrination," as quoted by the Associated Press.Walters has also pushed to revise Oklahoma’s curriculum standards to include conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election, a move criticised by Weingarten as prioritising political gain over education.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

Back-to-school season is here: How parents can help kids get back into routine

Experts stress the importance of sleep, consistent schedules, and student involvement in building healthy habits. Addressing first-day jitters and easing anxieties helps children feel prepared and confident. Ultimately, structured routines not only boost learning but also bring calm and balance to busy households.  After weeks of late nights, movie marathons, and unstructured summer days, the first week of school can feel like a jolt — not just for students, but for parents too. Across the country, some classrooms have already opened their doors while others are about to, marking the return of the back-to-school season in full swing.The key to easing this transition lies in resetting routines early, from bedtime to morning schedules, so children walk into classrooms feeling ready to learn. Beyond academics, these daily rhythms give children a sense of security, reduce stress, and make the entire household run more smoothly. For families, it’s less about strict rules and more about building habits that stick.Here’s how parents and students can work together to ease back into routine without the usual chaos.Why sleep is the foundation of learningSleep, unsurprisingly, tops the list. Research has long shown that a good night’s rest directly impacts focus, memory, and classroom performance. “We don’t say ‘get good sleep’ just because,” pediatrician Dr. Gabrina Dixon told the Associated Press. “It really helps kids learn and it helps them function throughout the day.” The right amount varies by age — preschoolers may need up to 13 hours, tweens nine to 12, and teenagers eight to 10.The takeaway? Sleep is not just rest, it’s fuel. Students who start the school year with consistent sleep patterns are more alert in class, and teachers find they are easier to engage.Building consistency beyond bedtimeBut routines aren’t just about sleep. Parents who create small, predictable rituals in the weeks before school — setting consistent wake-up times, practicing quicker morning checklists, and even limiting screen use at night — often find the school-day transition smoother. Dr. Nitun Verma of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine explained to the Associated Press that winding down with simple, calming activities like reading or showering helps children “slowly let go of the gas pedal” before bed.These small changes may feel minor, but they add up. Students who ease into the rhythm before school starts show up less anxious and better prepared for the demands of a new academic year.Let kids play a role in their routineFamilies also discover that kids themselves play a role in shaping routines. Author Nikkya Hargrove shared with the Associated Press how her 10-year-old twins negotiate for extra reading time before lights out. Some mornings, they regret staying up too late, but she sees that as part of the learning process. “If they’re groggy and they don’t like how they feel, then they know, ‘OK, I have to go to bed earlier,’” she said.Giving students ownership, even in small ways, builds responsibility. When routines feel collaborative rather than enforced, children are more likely to stick to them — and more likely to carry those habits into the classroom.Tackling first-day jittersThe other piece of the puzzle is managing first-day jitters. Experts say back-to-school anxiety can keep children wide awake, no matter how early the bedtime. Dixon advises parents to talk openly with kids about what worries them — whether it’s walking into a new classroom, meeting teachers, or making friends. Test runs, like visiting the school or attending open houses, can make the unfamiliar feel less intimidating.Addressing anxieties head-on helps students approach the first day with confidence. Teachers, too, benefit when students arrive more relaxed and ready to connect — setting the tone for a smoother year ahead.Parents are adjusting tooAnd if things don’t go perfectly? That’s normal. Parents, too, are adjusting to new schedules after summer’s flexibility. As Dixon told the Associated Press, “I always say, ‘Take a deep breath, it’ll be OK.’ And just start that schedule.” Ultimately, the goal isn’t perfection on day one — it’s progress over time. A steady rhythm not only helps children learn better but also brings calm to busy households navigating the back-to-school rush. In the long run, these everyday routines can be just as important as test scores or homework in shaping a child’s success.And the best part? Every new school year offers families a fresh chance to reset, reconnect, and build habits that will carry students through not just the months ahead, but well beyond the classroom.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

Rajinikanth's 'Coolie' is making waves at the North American box office, grossing USD 6.22 million in five days, nearing 'Chhaava's' total earnings. Despite mixed word-of-mouth and dipping daily collections, 'Coolie' showcases Rajinikanth's star power and the global appeal of Tamil cinema. In India, 'Coolie' faces collection drops, while 'Chhaava's' success highlights the diverse genres thriving abroad. Superstar Rajinikanth has once again proven his unmatched global appeal with his latest release Coolie, which has stormed the North American box office. The film has grossed an impressive USD 6.22 million in just five days, making it the second-biggest Indian film of 2025 in the region, second only to Chhaava.What makes this feat extraordinary is the pace at which Coolie has scaled these heights. While Chhaava, starring Vicky Kaushal, Rashmika Mandanna, and Akshaye Khanna, earned USD 6.4 million over its entire theatrical run, Coolie has nearly touched that figure within its first 5 days and now needs another USD 200K to breach that amount. While the film earned over USD 3 million just from its premiere shows, the word of mouth on the film isn't exactly great and hence its daily collections are dipping. It now all depends on the coming weekend if the film picks up again or not. The break-even point for the film has been pegged at USD 7.5 million which is still far away as the initial buzz and excitement for the film is over.‘Coolie’ release sparks madness: Rajinikanth fans dance and flood theatres in Tamil NaduIn India as well Coolie has been seeing a drop in it’s collection as in 5 days the film has collected a little over Rs 206 crore. The number in isolation looks big but given the star power attached to the film from Lokesh Kanagaraj to Nagarjuna to Upendra to Shruti Haasan to Aamir Khan, the number does not justify the scale. Chhaava, directed by Laxman Utekar, had been considered one of the surprise North American success stories of 2025. Its lifetime earnings of USD 6.4 million had set a benchmark for Bollywood films this year. While Coolie is now on the verge of overtaking that tally in less than a week underlines Rajinikanth’s unparalleled star power and the widening scope of Tamil blockbusters overseas but it will be a while before the film starts making profits for its distributors..Interestingly, the competition between Coolie and Chhaava also highlights how diverse genres of Indian cinema are thriving abroad. While Chhaava rode on historical grandeur and star-studded performances, Coolie has gone the other way delivering raw, massy entertainment that appeals directly to audiences looking for high-octane thrills on the big screen."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

It's now the sixth highest-grossing Hindi film of 2025 and may surpass Aamir Khan's 'Sitaare Zameen Par.'

Ashwin Kumar's mythological epic, 'Mahavatar Narsimha,' has become a box office success, grossing ₹161.1 crore in 25 days. It's now the sixth highest-grossing Hindi film of 2025 and may surpass Aamir Khan's 'Sitaare Zameen Par.' Despite facing competition, the film's strong performance, driven by positive word-of-mouth and cultural resonance, highlights the power of content-driven storytelling in Bollywood. Ashwin Kumar’s mythological epic Mahavatar Narsimha has scripted a remarkable success story at the Hindi box office. After a steady 25-day run, the film has collected Rs 161.1 crore net, officially making it the sixth highest-grossing Hindi film of 2025 so far. What’s more, with Aamir Khan’s Sitaare Zameen Par standing just ahead at Rs 166.18 crore, trade believes Mahavatar Narsimha could well challenge for the fifth spot by the coming weekend as the animation film was able to survive the clash between Rajinikanth’s Coolie and Hrithik Roshan-Jr NTR’s War 2 and both films are now losing audience with each passing day.The year 2025 has been crowded with big-ticket Hindi releases, ranging from historical dramas to comedies and sequels. The top five at the moment include Chhaava (Rs 585.7 crore), Saiyaara (Rs 324.67 crore), Housefull 5 (Rs 183.88 crore), Raid 2 (Rs 173.44 crore), and Sitaare Zameen Par (Rs 166.18 crore). For Mahavatar Narsimha a film without an A-list star headlining it breaking into this list is a feat in itself.The film opened modestly with Rs 1.35 crore on Day 1in Hindi, but its collections grew quickly as positive word-of-mouth spread and it ended week 1 on Rs 32.45 crore. By Week 2 the film added another Rs 54.95 crore to its kitty. During Week 3 the collections remained steady as it added another Rs 53.75 crore to its tally and during the fourth weekend it minted Rs 18.45 crore. On Monday the film earned another Rs 1.5 crore, taking the overall Hindi collection of the film to Rs 161.1 crore as per Sacnilk, while the overall collection of the film stands at Rs 212.6 crore Such box office stamina indicates that the film has connected deeply with audiences, particularly in the Hindi heartland, where mythological stories continue to hold immense cultural resonance.At its current total of Rs 161.1 crore, Mahavatar Narsimha is just Rs 5 crore short of overtaking Sitaare Zameen Par. Given its present trend of Rs 1-2 crore weekday earnings and higher weekend jumps, trade believes the crossover could happen within the next few days. If that occurs, Ashwin Kumar’s directorial will climb to the 5th position among 2025’s Hindi blockbusters, displacing an Aamir Khan starrer, no small achievement for a film led by content rather than sheer star power.The film’s success can be attributed to multiple factors. The mythological theme, blending spirituality with cinematic spectacle, has resonated with family audiences. With Rs 161.1 crore already in its kitty, Mahavatar Narsimha has not just surprised trade pundits but also cemented Ashwin Kumar’s place as a filmmaker to watch. The coming weekend will be crucial—if the film overtakes Sitaare Zameen Par, it will rewrite the rankings yet again and prove that content-driven storytelling still has the power to challenge Bollywood’s biggest stars at the box office."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

A Justin Bieber impersonator has gone viral online after managing to fool an entire Las Vegas nightclub that he was the real deal. The man believed to be Dylan Desclos, who promotes himself online as a “Justin Bieber lookalike” has taken social media by storm after he allegedly took over the microphone and rocked the stage at a nightclub, belting out Bieber's biggest hits and had many believing he was the superstar.Behind Bieber’s Smile: Insiders Say His Marriage Is Still In Trouble?The incident reportedly took place on Saturday at Wynn Las Vegas, where the impersonator managed to convince organisers he was the pop star. According to reports from TMZ, he even performed a few songs before staff realised he was a 'fake'.“After an elaborate and multi-step ruse by him and his advance team, a Justin Bieber impersonator was granted access to the XS stage. As soon as the error was recognized, he was removed from the resort and denied future entry,” a representative for Wynn and XS Nightclub said in a statement.DJ Gryffin, who was performing at the club, mistakenly invited the impersonator onstage and even shared a video of the incident on Instagram. Photos doing the rounds online even saw people at the club stopping him to pose for pictures. However, on being caught, the impersonator was reportedly kicked out and has been permanently banned from the nightclub.

The romantic drama has crossed USD 6 million in North America. It is now the third highest-grossing Indian film there. Saiyaara added nearly a million dollars in just 13 days. It is the second-highest-grossing Hindi film in North America. Mohit Suri's Saiyaara, starring Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda, is a hit overseas. The romantic drama has crossed USD 6 million in North America. It is now the third highest-grossing Indian film there. Saiyaara added nearly a million dollars in just 13 days. It is the second-highest-grossing Hindi film in North America. Mohit Suri’s Saiyaara, featuring newcomers Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda, has emerged as one of the biggest success stories of Indian cinema overseas this year. The romantic drama, which opened to warm word-of-mouth in India and abroad, has now crossed the coveted USD 6 million mark in North America, establishing itself as the third highest-grossing Indian film in the territory.The film, which had already earned USD 5.1 million till 5th August, continued its strong box office momentum in the weeks that followed. On 18th August, Saiyaara officially breached the USD 6 million milestone. That means the film added nearly a million dollars in just 13 days, a feat that underlines its consistent theatrical pull despite intense competition.‘Saiyaara’ breaks lifetime records of ‘War’ and ‘Dunki’ by crossing ₹500 cr worldwide in 18 days.The Rankings GameAmong Indian films in North America, Saiyaara now stands at No. 3, behind two heavyweight performers. At the top is Chhaava the historical epic starring Vicky Kaushal, Rashmika Mandanna, and Akshaye Khanna—which continues to lead with USD 6.4 million. Rajinikanth’s action-packed entertainer Coolie holds the second spot with USD 6.22 million.For Hindi films specifically, Saiyaara’s performance is even more remarkable. It is now the second-highest-grossing Hindi film ever in North America, trailing only Chhaava. Beating the ClashWhat makes Saiyaara’s journey more impressive is how it navigated a tough release window as after a strong run of 4 weeks the film ran into two behemoths Rajinikanth’s Coolie and Hrithik Roshan-Jr NTR’s War 2. While Coolie went on to mint USD 6.22 million in 5 days , War 2 also breached the USD 3 million mark. Yet, just as in the domestic market where it added Rs 1.90 crore in 4 days ( 14th August to 17th August) , Saiyaara managed to carve its own space overseas, proving that strong content and emotional appeal can help films rise above competition.Industry insiders point out that Mohit Suri’s brand of emotionally charged romance combined with a fresh pairing of Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda, and a well-curated music album has catapulted the film into everyone’s heart. For Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda, Saiyaara’s success is more than just box office numbers; it is a dream launch that has given them instant recognition on the global stage. And for Mohit Suri, it is yet another validation of his storytelling formula that continues to resonate with audiences across continents."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Joshi deemed the government's actions as unconstitutional and an attack on democracy. The film, directed by Vivek Agnihotri, explores the 1946 Great Calcutta killings and stars Anupam Kher and Mithun Chakraborty.  Actress Pallavi Joshi has criticised the West Bengal administration after the trailer launch of ‘The Bengal Files’ was allegedly stopped in Kolkata last week. Joshi, who stars in the movie, called the government’s actions “unconstitutional” and dubbed the halt an 'attack on democracy'.On August 16, 2025, the film's director, Vivek Agnihotri claimed that the trailer launch was stopped at a five-star hotel in Kolkata. NDTV later reported that Kolkata Police said the director had not sought administrative permission for a public trailer viewing. Videos of police entering the venue quickly went viral on social media.Anupam Kher Praises Pallavi Joshi; Actress Stuns In ‘Tanvi The Great’ First LookPallavi reactsAs reported by India Today, Pallavi spoke at the trailer launch in New Delhi on Monday and said, "Since the story is rooted in Bengal, we felt it would be most appropriate to launch the trailer in Bengal in August, but the government silenced us. We feel it is an act which is not only arbitrary but also unconstitutional."She added, "What happened that day was not merely an assault on the film, but an assault on democracy itself. The voices of people and the voice of Bharat were suppressed and censored. The absence of dignity and the absence of the value of human life are the themes of our film. The government proved our theme is correct."Trailer launch halted on “laughable grounds”Joshi also expressed frustration at the reason given for stopping the event, was on "very laughable grounds." She went on to add, "They said we didn't have municipal permission...The videos are about the chaos that followed. Many women journalists got hurt. I was also very uncomfortable. Thanks to Vivek, we managed to get out. We feel the police and the government are forgetting their basic duty, i.e, protecting its citizens, especially women, and their modesty. That should have been the sole priority of women."About ‘The Bengal Files’‘The Bengal Files’ is based on the 1946 Great Calcutta killings, a tragic historical episode during the final years of British colonial rule. The film stars Anupam Kher, Mithun Chakraborty, Saswata Chatterjee, and Pallavi Joshi. Directed by Vivek Agnihotri, the film is set to release on September 5, 2025."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Mithun Chakraborty, faced early career hurdles due to his skin color and financial struggles, even sleeping on footpaths.

Despite winning a National Award early on, he battled prejudice and professional setbacks. Zeenat Aman's support proved pivotal, leading to his rise as a superstar with films like 'Disco Dancer,' ultimately earning him the Dadasaheb Phalke Award.  Mithun Chakraborty, the star who danced his way into history with iconic hits like ‘Disco Dancer’, ‘Dance Dance’, ‘Pyar Jhukta Nahin’, ‘Kasam Paida Karne Wale Ki’ and ‘Commando’, has lived one of the most dramatic journeys in Bollywood. From being shamed for his skin colour and thrown out of films even after winning a National Award, to sleeping on footpaths during his struggling days, his rise was anything but easy.'Ek Ke Baad Ek BrahMos, Then A Pee Dam': Mithun Chakraborty Warns Pak, Takes Dig At Bilawal BhuttoMithun’s early daysMithun was born on 16 July 1950, as Gouranga Chakraborty. He studied at Kolkata’s Scottish Church College. Coming from a lower middle-class family, he faced financial struggles right from the start. Later, he cracked admission into the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), one of the country’s most prestigious film schools, where he trained to be a professional actor.Sleeping on footpaths to surviveHis road to films was far from easy. Before his debut, Mithun went through years of hardship in Mumbai. He often slept hungry and even spent nights on footpaths. Recalling those dark days on the reality show Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Li’l Champs, Mithun had said, “I have seen days when I had to sleep with an empty stomach, and I used to cry myself to sleep. In fact, there were days when I had to think about what my next meal will be, and where I will go to sleep. I have also slept on the footpath for a lot of days.”Why Mithun does not want a biopicDespite his success, Mithun never wants his life to be made into a film. He explained, “And that’s the only reason I don’t want my biopic to be ever made! My story will never inspire anyone, it will break them down (mentally) and discourage people from achieving their dreams. I don’t want that to happen! If I can do it, anyone else can do it. I have fought a lot to prove myself in this industry. I am not legendary because I have given hit movies, I am a legend because I have surpassed all the pains and struggles of my life.”Winning a National Award but losing workMithun made his big screen debut with Mrinal Sen’s ‘Mrigayaa’. The film not only marked his entry into Bollywood but also won him the National Award for Best Actor. While most actors wait years for such recognition, Mithun achieved it with his first film. But instead of helping his career, the award created unexpected problems.He recalled in an interview with India Today, “After Mrigayaa, I got my first National Award. As it happens, I started acting like Al Pacino. It felt like I was the greatest actor. My attitude changed, so the producer saw this and said, ‘get out.’ Then I realised my mistake.”Shamed for skin colour in BollywoodIf pride slowed him down, prejudice nearly broke him. Mithun was constantly reminded of his complexion. In an interview with Radio Nasha, he shared, “I was always called out for my skin colour. I have been disrespected for a lot of years because of my skin colour.”He used dance as a way to shift the focus, “I thought that if I danced with my legs, nobody would see my colour and that happened. My dance made people forget my colour. Nobody imagined a hero with my colour. I used to feel very bad and I used to cry.”Becoming the common man’s superstarFor millions of fans, Mithun became proof that even someone with nothing could make it big. He said,“Looking at me, people’s expectations increased and they thought that even my son can become an actor despite living in a chawl or village. I became a common man’s hero. It was a very big thing for me to become a superstar of a common man.”Zeenat Aman breaks the industry jinxJust when he was being pushed aside, help came from one of Bollywood’s leading ladies. Zeenat Aman, who was at the peak of her career, agreed to star opposite him in Brij Sadanah’s ‘Taqdeer’. It proved to be a turning point.As Mithun shared on Sa Re Ga Ma Pa, “It was Zeenat ji who broke the jinx. Zeenat ji had the status of the number 1 heroine of that time, so following her footsteps, every other actress started saying yes to the films that I worked in. With Taqdeer’s release, I became an A-category actor.”From ‘Surakshaa’ to ‘Disco Dancer’ fameThree years after ‘Mrigayaa’, Mithun hit another milestone with the 1979 spy thriller ‘Surakshaa’. This film laid the foundation for his superstardom in the ’80s. The success was followed by blockbusters like ‘Disco Dancer’, ‘Dance Dance’, ‘Pyar Jhukta Nahin’, ‘Kasam Paida Karne Wale Ki’, and many more’. His unique moves and on-screen charm made him the king of dance films and one of the biggest stars of that decade.Beyond commercial hits, Mithun proved himself as a serious actor too. As reported by IMDb, he went on to star in over 350 films across multiple languages. He went on to win two more National Awards for ‘Tahader Katha’ in 1992 and ‘Swami Vivekananda’ in 1998. Decades later, his contribution to Indian cinema was celebrated once again when he was honoured with the Dadasaheb Phalke Award at the 70th National Film Awards in 2024."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli are one of the most loved celebrity couples in India. Though they kept their relationship quiet in the beginning, once they tied the knot, they never shied away from showing affection for each other in public. One of the most adorable moments between them happens on the cricket ground. Every time Virat scores a century, he blows a flying kiss towards Anushka in the stands.But did you know that this sweet tradition once became the subject of a light-hearted tease on television? It happened on none other than ‘Kaun Banega Crorepati’, where Amitabh Bachchan himself pulled Anushka’s leg in front of a live audience.When Anushka came to ‘KBC’A few years ago, Anushka had joined Big B’s popular quiz show ‘Kaun Banega Crorepati’ to promote her film ‘Sui Dhaaga’ along with Varun Dhawan. While there, she also sat beside a participant on the hot seat. That was when the fun began.The ‘Zanjeer’ actor casually asked the contestant if she watches cricket on television. She replied that she does not. Amitabh then pointed out with a smile that Anushka certainly does.Anushka explained why she watches cricketThe contestant looked a little puzzled by his remark. To clear the confusion, Anushka jumped in and said that her husband is a cricketer and that she watches cricket for him. That is when Amitabh decided to tease her. He asked cheekily, “Kewal unko dekhne ke kiye (Just for him)?” The ‘Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi’ actress quickly corrected herself, adding that she also watches to support the team.Amitabh mimicked Virat’s flying kissNot letting the fun stop there, the ‘Sholay’ actor went on to tease her further. He said everyone knows what happens on television and then, to the surprise of all, blew a kiss to the camera. The gesture was a clear imitation of Virat’s famous flying kiss celebration on the field.The moment had everyone in splits. Anushka burst out laughing, the audience clapped and laughed, and Varun Dhawan could not control himself either. He was seen rolling with laughter as Amitabh pulled off the playful act perfectly.Virat and Anushka’s wedding and childrenAnushka and Virat took their relationship to the next step when they tied the knot in a dreamy ceremony in December 2017. The much-talked-about wedding was followed by more happy news. The couple was blessed with their daughter Vamika in January 2021, and later, they welcomed their son Akaay in February 2024. Their life as parents has been filled with love and joy, and they have always tried to keep their children away from the media glare.Couple enjoys family time in LondonCurrently, Anushka and Virat are in London, where they are spending some private family time together. Videos recently surfaced on social media, showing the couple enjoying a sunny day out. Interestingly, they were spotted without their children Vamika and Akaay during this outing.

Matthew Perry death: 'Ketamine Queen' to plead guilty
A dealer dubbed the "Ketamine Queen" has agreed to plead guilty to supplying the drugs that killed "Friends" actor Matthew Perry, the US Department of Justice said Monday. Iwamasa repeatedly injected Perry with the ketamine that Sangha supplied, including on October 28, 2023, when he administered at least three shots of Sangha's ketamine, which killed the actor.

Iwamasa repeatedly injected Perry with the ketamine that Sangha supplied, including on October 28, 2023, when he administered at least three shots of Sangha's ketamine, which killed the actor.  Jasveen Sangha, a dealer dubbed the "Ketamine Queen" has agreed to plead guilty to supplying the drugs that killed "Friends" actor Matthew Perry, the US Department of Justice said Monday.Sangha, 42, will admit several charges, including one of distribution of ketamine resulting in death or serious bodily injury in relation to the late star.A dual citizen of the United States and Britain, she is expected to formally enter her pleas in the coming weeks. She has been in federal custody since August 2024.Sangha will become the fifth person to admit playing a part in the death of the beloved actor, who had openly struggled for decades with substance addiction.Perry, 54, was found dead in the hot tub of his Los Angeles home in October 2023.A criminal investigation was launched soon after an autopsy discovered he had high levels of ketamine -- an anesthetic -- in his system.Last month, Dr Salvador Plasencia pleaded guilty to four counts of distribution of ketamine in the weeks before Perry's death.Another doctor, Mark Chavez, admitted last year to conspiring to distribute ketamine to Perry.Plasencia allegedly bought ketamine off Chavez and sold it to the American-Canadian actor at hugely inflated prices."I wonder how much this moron will pay," Plasencia wrote in one text message.According to her plea agreement, Sangha worked with a middleman, Erik Fleming, to sell 51 vials of ketamine to Perry's live-in personal assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa.Iwamasa repeatedly injected Perry with the ketamine that Sangha supplied, including on October 28, 2023, when he administered at least three shots of Sangha's ketamine, which killed the actor.The Justice Department said when Sangha heard news reports about Perry's sudden death, she tried to cover her tracks."Delete all our messages," she instructed Fleming.When investigators raided Sangha's home they found methamphetamine, ketamine, ecstasy, cocaine, and counterfeit Xanax pills, as well as a money counting machine, a scale, and devices to detect wireless signals and hidden cameras, according to the Justice Department.- 'Mostly sober' -Sangha is expected to plead guilty to one count of maintaining a drug-involved premises, three counts of distribution of ketamine, and one count of distribution of ketamine resulting in death or serious bodily injury."She's taking responsibility for her actions," her lawyer Mark Geragos told AFP.Sangha could face decades in prison when sentenced.The other people involved in the supply of drugs to Perry are expected to appear in court over the coming months to learn their fates.Perry had been taking ketamine as part of supervised therapy for depression.But prosecutors say that before his death he became addicted to the substance, which also has psychedelic properties and is a popular party drug."Friends," which followed the lives of six New Yorkers navigating adulthood, dating and careers, drew a massive following and made megastars of previously unknown actors.Perry's role as the sarcastic man-child Chandler brought him fabulous wealth, but hid a dark struggle with addiction to painkillers and alcohol.In 2018, he suffered a drug-related burst colon and underwent multiple surgeries.In his 2022 memoir "Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing," Perry described going through detox dozens of times."I have mostly been sober since 2001," he wrote, "save for about sixty or seventy little

A viral gym video showcases his dedication to fitness through disciplined workouts. Beyond physical exercise, he emphasizes yoga, meditation, and a clean vegetarian diet for overall well-being. His latest film, ‘Coolie,’ released on August 14th, has already grossed over Rs.  Rajinikanth, often called one of the greatest icons of Indian cinema, has ruled the silver screen for nearly fifty years. With a career packed with blockbuster hits and an unmatched fan base, his charm and energy continue to inspire people across the world. Even at seventy-four, the superstar of ‘Coolie’ and ‘Jailer’ shows no signs of slowing down. Instead, he is proving every day that age is no barrier to fitness, health and success.Viral gym videoRecently, a short clip of Rajinikanth exercising in a gym went viral on social media. Fans were thrilled to see the actor working out with the same discipline that made him a star. In the video, he begins with an incline dumbbell press, building strength in his upper body. He then moves to squats with the help of a bench, targeting his legs and core. To finish, he flexes his biceps while his trainer stands proudly beside him. The video was shared widely, with fans praising his determination and showing how fitness is a lifelong commitment.The power of Yoga, Meditation and KriyaWhile gym workouts are important, Rajinikanth also gives equal importance to inner strength. Yoga and breathing exercises have been part of his daily routine for years, reported The Health Site. In an interview cited by Telugu movie entertainment website Cinejosh, he has often credited more than 20 years of Kriya Yoga practice for giving him energy, focus and inner calm. This discipline, he believes, is the real reason behind his ability to remain positive and balanced even with the pressures of stardom.A simple and clean vegetarian dietRajinikanth made a big change in his lifestyle in 2014 when he adopted vegetarianism for health reasons. Since then, his meals are fresh, simple and home-cooked. As reported by Business Standard, he prefers fruits, vegetables, grains and nuts, while cutting out processed foods, sugar, fast food and refined dairy products. This clean diet not only keeps his body fit but also gives him the energy he needs to perform with such vigour on screen.Rest, recovery and time in natureAnother secret to his energy is proper rest and recovery. Sleep is non-negotiable for Rajinikanth. After completing each film, he takes time off to recharge and visits the Himalayas, where he finds both peace and strength in the lap of nature. These trips are not just about physical rest but also about spiritual healing, which helps him return to work with renewed energy.Discipline over quick fixesUnlike many who look for shortcuts, Rajinikanth’s fitness is built on years of discipline. He combines structured workouts, meditation, clean eating and rest in a way that balances both body and mind. His lifestyle shows that real strength comes from consistency, mindfulness and a deep spiritual connection. This is why he remains a wellness icon for fans across all age groups.‘Coolie’ roars at the Box OfficeEven as he maintains his health, Rajinikanth continues to deliver massive hits. His latest film ‘Coolie’, released on 14 August, turned theatres into a festival. The film created huge excitement from the start and lived up to expectations with a strong opening. Despite clashing with the big Bollywood spy thriller ‘War 2’, starring Hrithik Roshan, Jr NTR and Kiara Advani, ‘Coolie’ stormed ahead from day one. According to Sacnilk, the film collected over Rs. 206 crores in just five days, proving once again that Rajinikanth’s magic at the box office is as powerful as ever."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
