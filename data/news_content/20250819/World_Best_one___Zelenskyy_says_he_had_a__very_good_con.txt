The Ukrainian president indicated that he would like to see President Trump participate in a future meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, if such a meeting takes place. "President Trump will try to organize such a meeting," Zelensky said of Trump's push for another meeting with Putin.

Alexander Stubb: Finnish President Alexander Stubb praised US President Donald Trump for the progress made in talks to resolve Russia’s war in Ukraine. “I think in the past two weeks, we’ve probably had more progress in ending this war than we have in the past three and a half years,” he said today, pointing to the symbolic nature of the leaders gathering to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine.Friedrich Merz: German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the path is open for more serious negotiations to be held on the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. “I can’t imagine that the next meeting will take place without a ceasefire,” he said. “So let’s work on that.”Mark Rutte: “The fact that you have said ‘I am willing to participate in the security guarantees’ is a big step, it’s really a breakthrough, and it makes all the difference. So also thank you for that,” Nato secretary general Mark Rutte said to Trump. Emmanuel Macron: French president Emmanuel Macron said a European leader should be at the table when Trump, Zelenskyy, Putin sit for the next meeting. “I think as a follow up, we would need probably a quadrilateral meeting. Because when we speak about security guarantees, we speak about the whole security of the European continent,” he said.Giorgia Meloni: Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni thanks Trump for Russia's willingness to talk about ending the war. "I think it is an important day, a new phase, after three years ... [when] we didn't see any kind of sign from the Russian side, that there [is] a willingness for dialogue," she said. "So something is changing.
