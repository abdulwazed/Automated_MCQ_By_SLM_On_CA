Suryakumar Yadav NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Ambati Rayudu has shed new light on one of the most debated moments from the T20 World Cup 2024 final between India and South Africa — Suryakumar Yadav’s boundary catch to dismiss David Miller. According to Rayudu, the catch became possible because the boundary rope had been unintentionally pushed back earlier in the day when broadcast equipment was placed near the rope.Rayudu’s revelation comes more than a year after India’s title-winning final against South Africa, where Suryakumar’s stunning effort at the boundary was remembered as one of the defining moments.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'The dismissal, which turned out to be a defining moment in India’s triumph, drew scrutiny when replays showed the rope appeared to be positioned differently than usual.Speaking on the Unfiltered Podcast, Rayudu, who was part of the commentary team during the final, explained: "There were world feed commentators. During the break, what usually happens is they put a chair there and a screen in order to help the broadcasters see what is happening. That is why they pushed the rope backwards a little bit. But, they left it like that (even after taking the screen and the chair away). That is how the boundary became a little bigger for us. We (the commentators) could see it from above. It was god's plan."When asked whether the shot would have cleared the boundary under normal circumstances, Rayudu replied:PollDo you agree with Rayudu's statement that 'God was with us'?Yes, it's a matter of fateNo, skill was the deciding factorI think it's a mix of bothI don't believe in fate"I don't know if it was a six (in natural circumstances) or not. If the rope had been placed at its normal position, maybe Surya would've run from inside."Despite the controversy, Rayudu insisted the dismissal was legitimate. "End of the day, God was with us," he said, adding that it was a “clean catch.”The rope placement sparked reactions from several current and former cricketers at the time, though the debate eventually faded.
