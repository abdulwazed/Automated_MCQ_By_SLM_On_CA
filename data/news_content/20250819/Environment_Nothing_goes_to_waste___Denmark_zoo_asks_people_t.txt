(Ai generated image)  If you have a pet you can no longer keep, one zoo in Denmark is offering an unusual option.Aalborg Zoo is asking the public to donate small pets — not for rehoming, but to be used as food for its captive predators.Aalborg Zoo, located in northern Denmark, said in a Facebook post that the move is meant to mimic the natural food chain of animals housed there. The zoo says this effort supports “animal welfare and professional integrity,” and assures that any donated pets will be “gently euthanized” by trained staff.“If you have a healthy animal that needs to be given away for various reasons, feel free to donate it to us,” the post said.The zoo lists rabbits, guinea pigs, horses and chickens as examples of suitable donations.PollWhat do you think about Aalborg Zoo's practice of accepting pets for food for predators?Support it for animal welfareOppose it, find other solutionsOnce euthanised, the animals will be used as fodder for the zoo’s carnivores.“That way, nothing goes to waste — and we ensure natural behaviour, nutrition and well-being of our predators,” the zoo claimed.The post is accompanied by a picture of a wildcat showing its teeth with its mouth wide open.
