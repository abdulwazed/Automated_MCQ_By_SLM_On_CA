She replied that she does not. Amitabh then pointed out with a smile that Anushka certainly does.Anushka explained why she watches cricketThe contestant looked a little puzzled by his remark. To clear the confusion, Anushka jumped in and said that her husband is a cricketer and that she watches cricket for him. That is when Amitabh decided to tease her.

Anushka burst out laughing, the audience clapped and laughed, and Varun Dhawan could not control himself either. He was seen rolling with laughter as Amitabh pulled off the playful act perfectly.Virat and Anushka’s wedding and childrenAnushka and Virat took their relationship to the next step when they tied the knot in a dreamy ceremony in December 2017.
