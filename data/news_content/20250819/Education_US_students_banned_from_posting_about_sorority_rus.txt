US students banned from posting about sorority rush as RushTok on TikTok turns toxic: Here's why Greek life is going offline
US universities, especially the University of Alabama, are discouraging students from posting on TikTok during sorority recruitment due to rising online backlash. RushTok, which popularised the process online, has exposed participants to criticism and mental health stress. Some sororities have informally banned prospects from media interaction. Despite potential earnings and exposure, students now face pressure to remain offline during rush. Financial costs, emotional strain, and concerns over social media’s influence have driven this shift.

(AP Photo) Sororities across the US are implementing strict social media bans during recruitment week, marking a significant shift from the viral TikTok phenomenon that once celebrated Greek life culture. Sororities are exclusive women's social organisations at American universities, typically founded on principles of sisterhood, academic achievement and community service, with membership considered a privilege that students must earn through a competitive selection process.The move comes after several high-profile cases where students faced severe online harassment following their participation in "RushTok" content. Kylan Darnell, who became an overnight celebrity through her University of Alabama sorority content four years ago, has stepped back from social media after experiencing mental health impacts from negative reactions to her posts, as reported by the Associated Press. The 21-year-old rising senior, who was a member of Zeta Tau Alpha, previously embodied the RushTok movement that documented the week-long recruitment process.Sororities cite harassment concernsMany sororities have issued de facto bans against speaking to press or posting on social media during rush week at Alabama, which hosts the nation's largest on-campus Greek life with nearly 13,000 participating students, according to the Associated Press. The measures are designed to protect prospects from harassment that has become increasingly common as the recruitment process, known as "rush," involves students trying out for sororities through rounds of activities with strict dress codes and etiquette requirements.Financial pressures of recruitmentThe recruitment process carries substantial financial commitments for participants. This week's 2,600 recruits each paid $550 to participate in a non-refundable fee structure, as reported by the Associated Press. Accepted members face average costs of $8,400 per semester to live in sorority houses, or $4,100 if residing elsewhere, according to the Alabama Panhellenic Association.Students often spend tens of thousands on outfits, makeup and travel expenses before even beginning the process. An entire consulting industry has emerged, with some services charging up to $10,000 for months of guidance beginning in high school, as students submit "social resumes" and letters of recommendation from sorority alumni.Social media influence and consequencesMorgan Cadenhead, now 20, gained such a following through RushTok despite being dropped that she covered most of her tuition through social media income, the Associated Press reported. However, she faced significant online criticism for her comments about Greek life and now seeks offline employment opportunities. The marketing major was featured on Lifetime's "Sorority Mom's Guide to Rush!" programme.Lorie Stefaneli, a New York City-based consultant who works with students nationwide, told the Associated Press she serves as "literally a therapist" during rush week, taking calls at all hours. "I'm talking these girls down from a ledge," she said, as reported by the Associated Press.Strict posting policies implementedMultiple incoming freshmen confirmed to the Associated Press that they were explicitly prohibited from media interviews or rush-related social media posts. Darnell noted that selective "Old Row" houses automatically drop prospects who post content during recruitment."Now a lot of girls just come to the university to be influencers," Darnell told the Associated Press. "It kind of gets in the way of sisterhood."Some students, including Darnell's 19-year-old sister Izzy, continue posting despite restrictions, generating millions of views within days whilst satisfying demand for content about the traditionally secretive process.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.
