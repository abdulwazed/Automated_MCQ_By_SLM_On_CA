Jabbar has directed senior faculty and department heads not to issue public statements without approval, warning of disciplinary action for media or social media criticism. The move follows remarks by doctors Mohandas and Harris Chirakkal on stalled cadaver organ transplantation and policy lapses, sparking debate over transparency and academic freedom.  Thiruvananthapuram, India: The Principal of Thiruvananthapuram Medical College, Dr. P.K. Jabbar, has issued a directive prohibiting department heads and senior faculty from making public statements without prior approval.The decision was formally conveyed during a meeting of department heads, following controversies triggered by remarks from two senior doctors, Dr. Mohandas and Dr. Harris Chirakkal.According to the directive, any grievances, concerns, or criticisms must be routed through official channels and communicated to higher authorities within the medical education department. Direct remarks in the media, on social media, or in public forums could invite disciplinary action.The move comes after strong criticism by former Head of Nephrology, Dr. Mohandas, who alleged that there had been “absolutely no progress” in cadaver organ transplantation since 2017. His remarks, accompanied by a social media post with photos of deceased former department heads, drew wide attention before being deleted. A memo was later served on him.Similarly, Dr. Harris Chirakkal stated that despite repeatedly flagging concerns through official channels, inaction by authorities compelled him to go public, further fuelling debate over transparency in the medical education sector.Against this backdrop, the Principal warned all department heads not to repeat such actions, stressing that while internal complaints and suggestions are welcome, public criticism of government policies or institutional matters will not be tolerated.The directive, aimed at maintaining discipline in the institution, has also sparked discussions within the medical fraternity on whether restricting public expression could suppress genuine concerns about healthcare policy and patient welfare.

Inaugurated by Deputy CM Pravati Parida, the course has enrolled 31,000 students. IGNOU plans to translate all programmes into Odia within two years.  Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India: Odisha Higher Education Minister Suryabanshi Suraj on Monday expressed happiness over the launch of Indira Gandhi National Open University’s (IGNOU) Diploma in Early Childhood Care and Education (DECE) in Odia. The minister said most of the enrolled students are anganwadi workers or play school teachers, adding that the move is in line with the New Education Policy (NEP) to promote learning in the mother tongue. He said the course was inaugurated by Deputy Chief Minister Pravati Parida on August 18. “Most of the enrolled students are anganwadi workers or play school teachers. Under the New Education Policy, this is our step towards promoting education in the mother tongue. We are translating as many course materials in Odia as we can. Our intention is to make higher education more accessible,” Suraj told reporters. He informed that the state government had signed an MoU with IGNOU on June 9, under which the translation of the course material into Odia was to be completed within 100 days. “On June 9, we signed an MoU with IGNOU under which the process of translating the course material in Odia was to be completed in under 100 days. It was inaugurated today in the presence of Deputy CM Pravati Parida. Almost 31,000 students have enrolled in this course,” he added. IGNOU Vice Chancellor Uma Kanjilal said the introduction of the diploma course in Odia was the first step to make study material available in the language and overcome the language barrier. “This is our first step in making the course material available in the mother tongue. This will help us overcome the language barrier and is aligned with the NEP 2020. Within two to three months, other major programmes will also be translated into Odia. We plan to translate all the programmes within two years. Next will be undergraduate programmes, followed by postgraduate programmes,” Kanjilal said. The Odia course material and textbooks for the DECE were formally released on Monday by Deputy CM Pravati Parida and Higher Education Minister Suryabanshi Suraj. As per the MoU, IGNOU will gradually offer its undergraduate, postgraduate, doctoral, diploma, certificate courses, Bachelor of Vocational Studies, Travel and Tourism Management, BBA, MBA, and several other programmes in Odia. Previously, IGNOU offered the DECE in English, Hindi and Tamil. With this launch, Odia has also been added. The DECE is a one-year diploma course, open to students after completion of +2.

The halt follows disputes over OBC reservations and High Court interventions. The revised provisional merit list had been released, but round 1 seat allotment scheduled for August 20 is cancelled. Students and political leaders demand clarity on the next steps.  The West Bengal Medical Counselling Committee (WBMCC) has announced that the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test Undergraduate (NEET UG) 2025 counselling for MBBS and BDS courses has been suspended with immediate effect. The official notice, issued on Monday, stated that the process will remain “in abeyance until further orders.”The decision was made just a day after the revised provisional merit list for 85% state quota seats was released. A total of 11,178 candidates listed in the West Bengal NEET UG provisional merit list are now left uncertain about their admissions as the round 1 seat allotment, which was scheduled for August 20, stands cancelled.High Court intervention and revised scheduleEarlier, the Calcutta High Court had directed a halt to the state’s admission and recruitment procedures citing disputes over Other Backward Classes (OBC) reservation. The court later permitted the process to resume, instructing the West Bengal Joint Entrance Examinations Board (WBJEEB) to issue a fresh merit list by August 22. Following this directive, WBMCC published a revised merit list on August 16 and had set the round 1 seat allotment results for release on August 20 after 4 pm, with reporting between August 21 and 23.However, the new notification issued by WBMCC on Monday read:“The WB NEET UG Medical Dental 2025 Counseling/Admission process has been kept in abeyance till further order. All concerned are hereby informed accordingly.”Political reaction and student concernsThe sudden suspension has drawn sharp criticism. Union Minister of State for Education and Development of the North Eastern Region, Sukanta Majumdar, accused the state government of acting without justification. In a post on X, he wrote:“In the name of an ‘Urgent Notice,’ the West Bengal government has indefinitely suspended the WB NEET UG Medical Dental Counselling and Admission process without giving any proper reason. The future of the state’s medical students has been pushed into darkness.”He further questioned the intent behind the move: “Why was the admission counselling, once started, suddenly halted indefinitely? Is this yet another attempt to appease narrow political interests by granting undue privilege to a particular group under the guise of reservation?”With the admissions on hold, medical aspirants in the state are once again left in limbo, awaiting clarity on the next steps from the authorities.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

Stanford chooses legacy admissions over state funding: Here's why wealthy connections still trump California's ban
Stanford University will no longer accept California's state-funded student aid, allowing it to maintain legacy and donor-based admissions despite a new state law targeting such practices. The university will replace the aid with its own funds, avoiding new disclosure requirements. The law, effective September 1, stops short of penalising non-compliant institutions financially. Stanford assures that students' aid will remain unaffected, and generous internal scholarships will continue for low- and middle-income families.

The university will replace the aid with its own funds, avoiding new disclosure requirements. The law, effective September 1, stops short of penalising non-compliant institutions financially. Stanford assures that students' aid will remain unaffected, and generous internal scholarships will continue for low- and middle-income families. Legacy admissions continue at Stanford as university opts out of state funding. (AI Image) Stanford University has announced it will no longer participate in California's state-funded student aid programmes in order to maintain its practice of considering legacy and donor connections during undergraduate admissions. The move allows the university to bypass a new state law aimed at limiting the influence of alumni and donor ties in admissions decisions.The law, which takes effect on September 1, restricts private nonprofit colleges that receive state-funded student aid from using legacy or donor status as a factor in admissions. Institutions that continue the practice while accepting such aid are required to publicly disclose detailed admissions data. Stanford's decision ensures it avoids these reporting requirements and associated public scrutiny.Stanford confirms continuation of legacy and donor admissionsStanford stated it will continue to factor in applicants' ties to alumni and donors when selecting its undergraduate class for autumn 2026, according to reporting by Higher Ed Dive. The university explained that its withdrawal from state-funded aid is "in order to comply with recent California legislation." Stanford will instead use its own institutional scholarship funds to replace the state aid.As per institutional data cited by Higher Ed Dive, 13.6% of Stanford's admitted undergraduate class in autumn 2023 had donor or alumni connections. That year, the university's overall undergraduate acceptance rate stood at just under 4%.California law limits but does not prohibit legacy admissionsThe legislation, signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom, was originally introduced by former California Assemblymember Phil Ting following the US Supreme Court's 2023 ruling that ended race-conscious admissions. Ting's proposal initially aimed to impose financial penalties by cutting access to the Cal Grant — a state financial aid programme for students from low- and middle-income families — for institutions that continued legacy and donor admissions.However, as Higher Ed Dive reported, the final version of the law did not include financial penalties. Instead, it requires schools to disclose demographic and admissions data for applicants with and without legacy or donor ties. It also allows the California Department of Justice to publish a list of noncompliant institutions on its website, implementing a name-and-shame approach rather than direct funding cuts.Stanford students will not see financial aid reductionStanford confirmed that current and incoming students who were receiving aid from state programmes will not experience a decrease in financial assistance. "Students do not need to take any action," the university stated in a press release issued on July 29, as reported by Higher Ed Dive.Stanford continues to offer significant internal aid. Students from families earning below $100,000 annually pay no tuition, room, or board, while those from households making under $150,000 are exempt from tuition fees.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

For professionals, AI fluency drives career growth and adaptability, while for students, it builds confidence and future readiness. Embracing AI as a collaborator, with ethics in mind, is now essential for career survival.  In early 2023, IgniteTech CEO Eric Vaughan made a move that shook the tech world. He laid off nearly 80% of his workforce. The reason? Widespread resistance to adopting artificial intelligence (AI). Vaughan had introduced “AI Mondays,” a weekly day dedicated entirely to AI projects. But when employees, especially the technical teams, pushed back, he chose replacement over persuasion. Looking back, Vaughan described the decision as “extremely difficult,” yet he said he would do it again, according to the Fortune.For students and professionals navigating today’s workplace, this isn’t just a headline — it’s a wake-up call. AI literacy is no longer optional. It’s a skill that can shape careers, open doors, and, in some cases, determine whether you keep your job.Why AI literacy mattersAI literacy isn’t just about learning a new software or tool. It’s about understanding how AI works, its strengths and limitations, and the broader ethical questions it raises. It’s about knowing how to use AI to solve real-world problems, not just following instructions.When you build AI literacy, you approach technology with curiosity rather than fear. You see opportunities instead of obstacles. And in a world where AI is becoming central to almost every industry, that mindset is everything.For professionals: Staying ahead of the curveFor those already in the workforce, AI literacy can be a career game-changer. It allows you to integrate AI into your workflows, make faster decisions, and find creative solutions to problems. Those who resist risk being left behind, overtaken by colleagues or competitors who are comfortable leveraging AI to their advantage.But AI literacy isn’t just a technical skill. It sharpens your ability to think critically, make ethical choices, and solve complex problems creatively. Professionals who master AI aren’t just workers, they become indispensable contributors in a tech-driven world.For students: Preparing for the futureFor students stepping into the workforce, the stakes are just as high. Early exposure to AI, whether through projects, coursework, or personal experimentation, can give you an edge in a competitive job market. Understanding AI helps you meet the expectations of future employers and shows that you’re adaptable, curious, and proactive.Students who embrace AI as a collaborator, rather than a threat, also gain confidence in problem-solving and innovation. Learning to work with AI early sets the stage for creative thinking and equips you to navigate challenges in professional settings with ease.How to navigate the AI landscapeLearning AI isn’t just about tools or coding, it’s a mindset. It’s about seeing AI as something that can augment human capabilities, not replace them. The more you engage with AI, experiment, and reflect on its outcomes, the better you understand its potential, and its limits.Ethics also matter. Knowing the societal impact of AI ensures that you use it responsibly, balancing innovation with accountability. In other words, AI literacy isn’t just a career skill — it’s a professional responsibility.The story of IgniteTech’s workforce overhaul is a stark reminder: in a world shaped by AI, failing to adapt is risky. For students entering the job market and professionals looking to stay relevant, investing time in AI literacy isn’t just smart, it’s essential.When you embrace AI, you don’t just keep pace — you gain the tools to navigate complexity, enhance your work, and contribute to a future where technology works for people, not the other way around.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

Education department delays put parenting college students in a bind: Here's why child care funding matters more than ever
Delays by the US Department of Education in renewing federal child care funding are putting parenting college students in a difficult position. The CCAMPIS grant, which supports campus-based child care services, faces uncertainty after funding applications were postponed.

Federal childcare funding delays threaten parenting students: What you need to know about CCAMPIS grant. (Getty Images) Parenting college students across the US are facing significant challenges due to delays in federal child care funding, jeopardising their ability to continue their education. The US Department of Education has postponed grant applications for several federal programmes, including the Child Care Access Means Parents in School (CCAMPIS) grant, which provides crucial support to student parents.The CCAMPIS grant, established by Congress in 1998, offers millions of dollars to colleges to fund campus-based child care services. This includes staff salaries, before- and after-school programmes, subsidies, and advising to help students with young children stay in school. However, delays in renewing this funding threaten to leave many parenting students without child care support early in the new academic year.Federal funding delays threaten vital child care supportThe CCAMPIS grant distributed over $83 million to hundreds of colleges in fiscal year 2023, with the average award exceeding $317,000 per institution, according to federal data cited by USA Today. This funding plays a key role in helping approximately one in five undergraduate students, who have children, complete their degrees.Carmina Garcia, a nursing student at Pima Community College in Arizona and mother of three young children, told USA Today, "I don't know how I could've done it any other way. If I wouldn't have found this, I don't think that I would be pursuing the education that I'm pursuing." Yet, her college has warned that the child care programme will end on September 30 due to funding delays.Similarly, Mahogany-Ann Fowler, an architecture student at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, faces uncertainty as her college's CCAMPIS funding is also set to expire on the same date. IUP spokesperson Michelle Fryling confirmed to USA Today that the university is "unsure of any personnel changes related to the end of this grant."Education Department cuts and grant delays cause confusionThe delays come after the US Department of Education halved its workforce in March under President Trump's administration. Typically, CCAMPIS renewal applications open in late May and close by July. However, the Education Department did not open applications this year, leaving students and colleges in limbo.James Hermes, associate vice president of government relations at the American Association of Community Colleges, told USA Today, "We're still very much on the edge of our seats." Experts suggest the delay could be due to staffing shortages or possible attempts to reduce funding, as President Trump's budget proposal suggested eliminating CCAMPIS funding altogether.Eddy Conroy, senior policy manager at New America, was quoted by USA Today questioning whether this is "a capacity issue" or "a backdoor way to illegally impound funds that have been appropriated."Students scramble for alternatives as support disappearsHannah Fuller, a 22-year-old student at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and a three-year CCAMPIS recipient, said her college is encouraging her to apply for state childcare programmes. Fuller told USA Today, "He would never see me," referring to her 4-year-old son, if she had to take on extra work to cover childcare.One college, Mount Wachusett Community College in Massachusetts, has taken proactive steps. Ann Reynolds, the CCAMPIS adviser, secured $94,000 from the college foundation to cover two years of childcare support, ensuring current students remain supported even if federal funds are delayed, as reported by USA Today.The ongoing delays in federal child care funding are creating considerable uncertainty for parenting college students nationwide, raising concerns about their ability to continue their education without this essential support.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill’: How students are rethinking their paths in higher education
President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed July 4, 2025, reshapes federal student loans by capping graduate borrowing, eliminating Grad PLUS loans, and altering repayment plans. A U.S. News survey shows over 60% of students expect personal impact, with many reconsidering degrees, course loads, or financing paths. Rising stress highlights the law’s sweeping effect on higher education.

A U.S. News survey shows over 60% of students expect personal impact, with many reconsidering degrees, course loads, or financing paths. Rising stress highlights the law’s sweeping effect on higher education.  When President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law on July 4, 2025, it promised to reshape the landscape of federal student loans. The law will introduce borrowing caps for graduate, medical, and law students, eliminate Grad PLUS loans, which previously allowed graduate students to borrow beyond federal limits, and fundamentally change income-driven repayment plans, which tie monthly payments to a borrower’s income.For many students, these changes are more than numbers on a page, they are decisions that will shape their academic journeys and financial futures. According to a survey by U.S. News of 1,190 college students conducted between July 31 and August 4, over a third (35%) are considering reducing their course load, while 32% are contemplating switching degrees.Most students anticipate personal impactThe survey suggests that the new law is not just theoretical. More than 60% of students say they expect to be personally affected, compared with 20% who say they will not, and 19% who are unsure, according to U.S. News. The changes that concern students most include the elimination of certain repayment options, such as the Biden-era SAVE Plan — a program that previously allowed borrowers to cap payments at a percentage of income while forgiving remaining debt after a set period. About a third of respondents (32%) cited this as a major concern.These numbers show that a majority of students are already feeling the potential financial squeeze and may need to rethink their borrowing strategies and budget planning.Understanding remains limitedDespite the law’s significance, many students remain unclear about its details. Only 20% of respondents said they fully understand how the law will affect them, while 19% admitted they do not understand it at all. Another 39% understand the changes partially, and 22% are unsure about the implications, according to U.S. News.Graduate and professional students — including those in medical and law programs — are more likely to pay attention to these changes, since the elimination of Grad PLUS loans and the new borrowing caps directly affect the amount they can borrow for tuition and living expenses.The data highlights the knowledge gap among students, indicating that many may make critical academic or financial decisions without full clarity.Opposition to the law is widespreadThe survey also highlights strong resistance among students. More than half (51%) said they do not support any of the changes. Approval for specific measures is limited, with about one-fifth supporting borrowing caps for graduate school, medical or law school programs, or the elimination of certain income-driven repayment plans, according to U.S. News.Student skepticism points to concerns over limited flexibility and the potential constraints on educational opportunities.Students reconsidering academic plansFor many, the financial constraints are forcing a reassessment of academic priorities. About 35% of students say they are considering reducing their course load, while 32% are weighing switching degrees. Others are exploring international study options (31%) or even military service (26%) to help finance their education. Among first-generation college students — those whose parents did not attend college — these figures rise to 45% for cutting back and 44% for switching majors, according to U.S. News.Student responses reveal the real pressure of financial changes on life decisions, as some reconsider long-term ambitions or make significant adjustments to their educational paths.Student voices illustrate the weight of these decisions. “I’m thinking about not finishing law school,” one student shared. Another, who had hoped to pursue medical school, admitted bluntly, “Honestly, I’m cooked,” according to U.S. News.Stress levels are risingThe new law is also affecting student well-being. Those who previously felt “extremely” stressed about paying for college accounted for 24%. That number has now climbed to 31% with the introduction of the Big Beautiful Bill, according to U.S. News.This increase in stress reflects the immediate pressure students face in balancing finances with academic goals, showing the human impact of policy changes.A policy reshaping higher education pathsThe Big Beautiful Bill is more than a legislative change, it is shaping how students plan their academic futures. With borrowing limits tightening and certain repayment programs eliminated, students are forced to recalibrate priorities, weigh new options, and, in some cases, rethink the very degrees they had planned to pursue.The coming months will reveal the full impact of the law, but for now, students across the country are facing a period of uncertainty, reflection, and careful planning — highlighting just how directly federal policy can influence personal educational journeys.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

US students banned from posting about sorority rush as RushTok on TikTok turns toxic: Here's why Greek life is going offline
US universities, especially the University of Alabama, are discouraging students from posting on TikTok during sorority recruitment due to rising online backlash. RushTok, which popularised the process online, has exposed participants to criticism and mental health stress. Some sororities have informally banned prospects from media interaction. Despite potential earnings and exposure, students now face pressure to remain offline during rush. Financial costs, emotional strain, and concerns over social media’s influence have driven this shift.

Financial costs, emotional strain, and concerns over social media’s influence have driven this shift. Sisters Kylan Darnell, 21, left, and Izzy Darnell, 19, pose for a photo on Aug. 14, 2025, in Tuscaloosa, Ala. (AP Photo) Sororities across the US are implementing strict social media bans during recruitment week, marking a significant shift from the viral TikTok phenomenon that once celebrated Greek life culture. Sororities are exclusive women's social organisations at American universities, typically founded on principles of sisterhood, academic achievement and community service, with membership considered a privilege that students must earn through a competitive selection process.The move comes after several high-profile cases where students faced severe online harassment following their participation in "RushTok" content. Kylan Darnell, who became an overnight celebrity through her University of Alabama sorority content four years ago, has stepped back from social media after experiencing mental health impacts from negative reactions to her posts, as reported by the Associated Press. The 21-year-old rising senior, who was a member of Zeta Tau Alpha, previously embodied the RushTok movement that documented the week-long recruitment process.Sororities cite harassment concernsMany sororities have issued de facto bans against speaking to press or posting on social media during rush week at Alabama, which hosts the nation's largest on-campus Greek life with nearly 13,000 participating students, according to the Associated Press. The measures are designed to protect prospects from harassment that has become increasingly common as the recruitment process, known as "rush," involves students trying out for sororities through rounds of activities with strict dress codes and etiquette requirements.Financial pressures of recruitmentThe recruitment process carries substantial financial commitments for participants. This week's 2,600 recruits each paid $550 to participate in a non-refundable fee structure, as reported by the Associated Press. Accepted members face average costs of $8,400 per semester to live in sorority houses, or $4,100 if residing elsewhere, according to the Alabama Panhellenic Association.Students often spend tens of thousands on outfits, makeup and travel expenses before even beginning the process. An entire consulting industry has emerged, with some services charging up to $10,000 for months of guidance beginning in high school, as students submit "social resumes" and letters of recommendation from sorority alumni.Social media influence and consequencesMorgan Cadenhead, now 20, gained such a following through RushTok despite being dropped that she covered most of her tuition through social media income, the Associated Press reported. However, she faced significant online criticism for her comments about Greek life and now seeks offline employment opportunities. The marketing major was featured on Lifetime's "Sorority Mom's Guide to Rush!" programme.Lorie Stefaneli, a New York City-based consultant who works with students nationwide, told the Associated Press she serves as "literally a therapist" during rush week, taking calls at all hours. "I'm talking these girls down from a ledge," she said, as reported by the Associated Press.Strict posting policies implementedMultiple incoming freshmen confirmed to the Associated Press that they were explicitly prohibited from media interviews or rush-related social media posts. Darnell noted that selective "Old Row" houses automatically drop prospects who post content during recruitment."Now a lot of girls just come to the university to be influencers," Darnell told the Associated Press. "It kind of gets in the way of sisterhood."Some students, including Darnell's 19-year-old sister Izzy, continue posting despite restrictions, generating millions of views within days whilst satisfying demand for content about the traditionally secretive process.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

Boston colleges brace as visa delays leave international students waiting
Visa backlogs are disrupting Boston’s academic and housing cycles, leaving apartments in Allston and Mission Hill vacant and international students in limbo. Landlords hesitate to rent without confirmed visas, while universities like Northeastern prepare with remote and overseas options. With forecasts of a 40% enrollment drop, the delays threaten students’ ambitions and Boston’s education-driven economy.

Landlords hesitate to rent without confirmed visas, while universities like Northeastern prepare with remote and overseas options. With forecasts of a 40% enrollment drop, the delays threaten students’ ambitions and Boston’s education-driven economy.  “Most apartment owners are like, ‘I can’t take the risk,’” says Boston realtor Terry Leung, according to WBUR. His remark points to a challenge much larger than Boston’s housing market — the growing uncertainty international students face as visa approvals slow down.Every fall, Boston braces for a new academic year with thousands of international students arriving to fill classrooms and apartments. But this year, visa backlogs have disrupted that rhythm. Students who have secured admission offers and even arranged housing are unable to move forward without an approved visa. Many landlords, as Leung explained, refuse to consider applications until visas are confirmed, leaving apartments in student-heavy neighborhoods like Allston and Mission Hill unexpectedly vacant well into the summer.Beyond Boston’s rental marketThe housing slowdown is only a symptom of the deeper issue. According to WBUR, international students are encountering longer waits for visa consultations and interview appointments. The Trump administration’s policies, including the addition of social media screenings in June, have made the process more time-consuming and unpredictable. For students, the uncertainty is not just logistical; it is emotional. Until visas are issued, they cannot book flights, confirm housing, or begin the transition to their new academic lives.While the broader Boston rental market had a normal leasing season, neighborhoods reliant on international student renters lagged sharply behind.The cost of waitingThe stakes are far higher than housing. International students are integral to the U.S. higher education system and its economy. Last year, they contributed $43 billion to the national economy through tuition, housing, food, and transportation, according to the Association of International Educators. “This is going to have a big ripple effect on local and state economies,” Sarah Spreitzer of the American Council on Education told WBUR.Universities in Boston are already preparing for disruption. Northeastern, where nearly two-thirds of graduate students are international, has offered options like remote learning, deferrals, and enrollment at its London and Canada campuses, WBUR noted. Other institutions are exploring similar contingency plans to ensure students don’t lose an academic year because of visa delays.Looking aheadThe Association of International Educators predicts up to a 40% drop in new international student enrollment this fall. For Boston, a city whose academic ecosystem is deeply tied to global student mobility, the implications are sobering.“I think all of our institutions are planning for a very real possibility of having fewer international students here in the United States come fall of 2025,” Spreitzer told WBUR.For students still waiting for visa appointments, the uncertainty is more than a policy issue, it is a pause on their ambitions. And for Boston, the empty apartments in Mission Hill and Allston stand as a visible reminder of how delays at embassies can ripple through universities, neighborhoods, and economies.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

Oklahoma requires teachers from California and New York to pass conservative loyalty test: Here's why critics call it 'MAGA indoctrination'
Oklahoma will require teachers from California and New York to pass a PragerU-administered exam aimed at preventing “radical leftist ideology” in classrooms. The test has drawn criticism from teachers’ unions and politicians, who label it a "MAGA loyalty test" and political posturing amid a teacher shortage. The assessment focuses on conservative principles and is set to become a mandatory part of teacher certification in the state, as reported by the Associated Press.

The test has drawn criticism from teachers’ unions and politicians, who label it a "MAGA loyalty test" and political posturing amid a teacher shortage. The assessment focuses on conservative principles and is set to become a mandatory part of teacher certification in the state, as reported by the Associated Press. Oklahoma’s new PragerU teacher exam sparks criticism over ‘MAGA loyalty test’ claims. (AI Image) Oklahoma will require teachers applying from California and New York to pass a new assessment designed to prevent the spread of what state officials describe as "radical leftist ideology." The Republican-controlled state’s education department announced that prospective teachers from these two blue states must clear a certification exam before gaining permission to teach in Oklahoma schools.The exam, administered by PragerU, a conservative nonprofit based in Oklahoma, forms part of the state’s effort to control the political content taught in classrooms. Opponents of the measure, however, have labelled the test a "MAGA loyalty test" aimed at imposing partisan viewpoints on educators, according to the Associated Press.What the test involves and who administers itRyan Walters, Oklahoma’s superintendent of public schools, stated on Monday that "as long as I am superintendent, Oklahoma classrooms will be safeguarded from the radical leftist ideology fostered in places like California and New York," as reported by the Associated Press. The test was developed in partnership with PragerU, an organisation known for producing short videos promoting conservative perspectives on politics and economics.The state has not publicly released the entire 50-question exam, but the Associated Press obtained the first five questions. These include inquiries about the first three words of the US Constitution and the importance of freedom of religion to America’s identity. Marissa Streit, CEO of PragerU, told CNN that several questions aim to address "undoing the damage of gender ideology," as quoted by the Associated Press.PragerU's role institutionalised in OklahomaQuinton Hitchcock, spokesperson for Oklahoma’s education department, said the assessment will be introduced "very soon." Experts note this marks a significant shift, with PragerU moving from an optional educational resource to an institutionalised gatekeeper for teacher certification in the state.Jonathan Zimmerman, a history of education professor at the University of Pennsylvania, called the move a "watershed moment," explaining that PragerU’s involvement in certification represents a formal endorsement of its materials. He noted that many teachers rely on online resources rather than textbooks for instruction, with PragerU now playing an official role in that process, as reported by the Associated Press.Criticism from teachers’ unions and politiciansThe American Federation of Teachers (AFT), one of the largest teachers’ unions in the US, criticised the requirement. AFT President Randi Weingarten described it as a "MAGA loyalty test" that would deter teachers in a state already facing a significant shortage, according to the Associated Press.State Democratic Party chairman John Waldron condemned the policy as "political posturing." Waldron, who moved from New Jersey to Oklahoma to teach social studies, said such tests would signal the state’s lack of seriousness in attracting quality educators and called it "a textbook definition of indoctrination," as quoted by the Associated Press.Walters has also pushed to revise Oklahoma’s curriculum standards to include conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election, a move criticised by Weingarten as prioritising political gain over education.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

Experts stress the importance of sleep, consistent schedules, and student involvement in building healthy habits. Addressing first-day jitters and easing anxieties helps children feel prepared and confident. Ultimately, structured routines not only boost learning but also bring calm and balance to busy households.  After weeks of late nights, movie marathons, and unstructured summer days, the first week of school can feel like a jolt — not just for students, but for parents too. Across the country, some classrooms have already opened their doors while others are about to, marking the return of the back-to-school season in full swing.The key to easing this transition lies in resetting routines early, from bedtime to morning schedules, so children walk into classrooms feeling ready to learn. Beyond academics, these daily rhythms give children a sense of security, reduce stress, and make the entire household run more smoothly. For families, it’s less about strict rules and more about building habits that stick.Here’s how parents and students can work together to ease back into routine without the usual chaos.Why sleep is the foundation of learningSleep, unsurprisingly, tops the list. Research has long shown that a good night’s rest directly impacts focus, memory, and classroom performance. “We don’t say ‘get good sleep’ just because,” pediatrician Dr. Gabrina Dixon told the Associated Press. “It really helps kids learn and it helps them function throughout the day.” The right amount varies by age — preschoolers may need up to 13 hours, tweens nine to 12, and teenagers eight to 10.The takeaway? Sleep is not just rest, it’s fuel. Students who start the school year with consistent sleep patterns are more alert in class, and teachers find they are easier to engage.Building consistency beyond bedtimeBut routines aren’t just about sleep. Parents who create small, predictable rituals in the weeks before school — setting consistent wake-up times, practicing quicker morning checklists, and even limiting screen use at night — often find the school-day transition smoother. Dr. Nitun Verma of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine explained to the Associated Press that winding down with simple, calming activities like reading or showering helps children “slowly let go of the gas pedal” before bed.These small changes may feel minor, but they add up. Students who ease into the rhythm before school starts show up less anxious and better prepared for the demands of a new academic year.Let kids play a role in their routineFamilies also discover that kids themselves play a role in shaping routines. Author Nikkya Hargrove shared with the Associated Press how her 10-year-old twins negotiate for extra reading time before lights out. Some mornings, they regret staying up too late, but she sees that as part of the learning process. “If they’re groggy and they don’t like how they feel, then they know, ‘OK, I have to go to bed earlier,’” she said.Giving students ownership, even in small ways, builds responsibility. When routines feel collaborative rather than enforced, children are more likely to stick to them — and more likely to carry those habits into the classroom.Tackling first-day jittersThe other piece of the puzzle is managing first-day jitters. Experts say back-to-school anxiety can keep children wide awake, no matter how early the bedtime. Dixon advises parents to talk openly with kids about what worries them — whether it’s walking into a new classroom, meeting teachers, or making friends. Test runs, like visiting the school or attending open houses, can make the unfamiliar feel less intimidating.Addressing anxieties head-on helps students approach the first day with confidence. Teachers, too, benefit when students arrive more relaxed and ready to connect — setting the tone for a smoother year ahead.Parents are adjusting tooAnd if things don’t go perfectly? That’s normal. Parents, too, are adjusting to new schedules after summer’s flexibility. As Dixon told the Associated Press, “I always say, ‘Take a deep breath, it’ll be OK.’ And just start that schedule.” Ultimately, the goal isn’t perfection on day one — it’s progress over time. A steady rhythm not only helps children learn better but also brings calm to busy households navigating the back-to-school rush. In the long run, these everyday routines can be just as important as test scores or homework in shaping a child’s success.And the best part? Every new school year offers families a fresh chance to reset, reconnect, and build habits that will carry students through not just the months ahead, but well beyond the classroom.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.
