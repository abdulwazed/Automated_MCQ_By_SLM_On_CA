Experts stress the importance of sleep, consistent schedules, and student involvement in building healthy habits. Addressing first-day jitters and easing anxieties helps children feel prepared and confident. Ultimately, structured routines not only boost learning but also bring calm and balance to busy households.  After weeks of late nights, movie marathons, and unstructured summer days, the first week of school can feel like a jolt — not just for students, but for parents too. Across the country, some classrooms have already opened their doors while others are about to, marking the return of the back-to-school season in full swing.The key to easing this transition lies in resetting routines early, from bedtime to morning schedules, so children walk into classrooms feeling ready to learn. Beyond academics, these daily rhythms give children a sense of security, reduce stress, and make the entire household run more smoothly. For families, it’s less about strict rules and more about building habits that stick.Here’s how parents and students can work together to ease back into routine without the usual chaos.Why sleep is the foundation of learningSleep, unsurprisingly, tops the list. Research has long shown that a good night’s rest directly impacts focus, memory, and classroom performance. “We don’t say ‘get good sleep’ just because,” pediatrician Dr. Gabrina Dixon told the Associated Press. “It really helps kids learn and it helps them function throughout the day.” The right amount varies by age — preschoolers may need up to 13 hours, tweens nine to 12, and teenagers eight to 10.The takeaway? Sleep is not just rest, it’s fuel. Students who start the school year with consistent sleep patterns are more alert in class, and teachers find they are easier to engage.Building consistency beyond bedtimeBut routines aren’t just about sleep. Parents who create small, predictable rituals in the weeks before school — setting consistent wake-up times, practicing quicker morning checklists, and even limiting screen use at night — often find the school-day transition smoother. Dr. Nitun Verma of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine explained to the Associated Press that winding down with simple, calming activities like reading or showering helps children “slowly let go of the gas pedal” before bed.These small changes may feel minor, but they add up. Students who ease into the rhythm before school starts show up less anxious and better prepared for the demands of a new academic year.Let kids play a role in their routineFamilies also discover that kids themselves play a role in shaping routines. Author Nikkya Hargrove shared with the Associated Press how her 10-year-old twins negotiate for extra reading time before lights out. Some mornings, they regret staying up too late, but she sees that as part of the learning process. “If they’re groggy and they don’t like how they feel, then they know, ‘OK, I have to go to bed earlier,’” she said.Giving students ownership, even in small ways, builds responsibility. When routines feel collaborative rather than enforced, children are more likely to stick to them — and more likely to carry those habits into the classroom.Tackling first-day jittersThe other piece of the puzzle is managing first-day jitters. Experts say back-to-school anxiety can keep children wide awake, no matter how early the bedtime. Dixon advises parents to talk openly with kids about what worries them — whether it’s walking into a new classroom, meeting teachers, or making friends. Test runs, like visiting the school or attending open houses, can make the unfamiliar feel less intimidating.Addressing anxieties head-on helps students approach the first day with confidence. Teachers, too, benefit when students arrive more relaxed and ready to connect — setting the tone for a smoother year ahead.Parents are adjusting tooAnd if things don’t go perfectly? That’s normal. Parents, too, are adjusting to new schedules after summer’s flexibility. As Dixon told the Associated Press, “I always say, ‘Take a deep breath, it’ll be OK.’ And just start that schedule.” Ultimately, the goal isn’t perfection on day one — it’s progress over time. A steady rhythm not only helps children learn better but also brings calm to busy households navigating the back-to-school rush. In the long run, these everyday routines can be just as important as test scores or homework in shaping a child’s success.And the best part? Every new school year offers families a fresh chance to reset, reconnect, and build habits that will carry students through not just the months ahead, but well beyond the classroom.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.
