Discussions included the challenges of space travel and experiments with food. Modi emphasized the need for more Indian astronauts. Shukla stressed the importance of government support for space research. PM Modi met Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla in New Delhi on Monday.  (ANI) NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday met Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, who returned to Earth in July after completing NASA’s Axiom-4 mission, becoming the first Indian in four decades to travel to space. During their interaction, Shukla shared that people around the world are following India’s upcoming Gaganyaan mission with great enthusiasm. “Wherever I went, whoever I met, everyone was very happy to meet me, very excited. The biggest thing was that everyone knew about what India is doing in the field of space. Everyone knew about this, and many people were more excited about Gaganyaan. They would come and ask me, ‘When is your mission going?’ And my crew members made me sign that whenever Gaganyaan is gone, you will invite us to the launch,” he said. PM Modi asked him, “As the first Indian to reach there, what are your thoughts? And what kind of questions do people ask?” Shukla replied that the interest was overwhelming and reflected India’s growing stature in space exploration.PollDo you think India's Gaganyaan mission will inspire future generations to pursue careers in space exploration?Yes, absolutely!No, not really. The prime minister also inquired about the physical changes after such a long journey in space. Shukla explained, “The environment up there is very different. Once we reach space, we can remove our seat belts and move around inside the capsule. The heart rate slows down, but the body starts adjusting in 3-4 days. But when we return to Earth, the body takes time to readjust. Even though I was healthy, I couldn't walk properly. People had to hold me for support.” When asked about experiments with moong and methi (fenugreek), Shukla described the challenge of food in space. “Food is a big challenge on a space station; there is less space, and cargo is expensive. You always try to pack as many calories and nutrients as possible in the least space, and experiments are going on in every way. They are very easy to grow and need very few resources, just a little water, and they sprout in only 8 days. These are some of the secrets of our country.” PM Modi recalled that Shukla was once called a “tag genius” and asked him the reason behind it. Shukla responded, “…When I joined the Air Force, I thought that I would not have to study, but I will have to study a lot after that. And after becoming a test pilot, it becomes a discipline of engineering. So I think we were well prepared, when we reached for this mission...The mission has been successful, we have returned, but this mission is not the end, it is the beginning...” The prime minister stressed the need for India to have a pool of 40-50 astronauts. Shukla, reflecting on his own journey, said children today are far more hopeful about becoming astronauts than his generation was. “When I was young, Rakesh Sharma sir went for the first time in 1984, but the dream of becoming an astronaut never came to my mind because we did not have any program. But when I went to the station this time, I spoke to the children three times. In every program, the children asked how can I become an astronaut? So I think this in itself is a big success for our country. In today’s India, they know that it is possible. We have the option and we can become. And like you said, it is my responsibility, I feel I got a lot of opportunities to represent my country and now it is my responsibility to take as many people as possible to this level.” PM Modi added, “Space station and Gaganyaan. These are our big missions. Your experience will be very useful in that.” Shukla praised the government’s commitment to space research, even in the face of setbacks. “I think somewhere there is a very big opportunity for us, especially because the kind of commitment our government has made to sustain the space program, budget every year, inspite of failures like Chandrayaan 2. Even after that, we said no, we will move ahead. Chandrayaan 3 was successful. Even after such failures, if we are getting so much support and the whole world is seeing this. We have the capability, so we can acquire a leadership role here. You talked about Atmanirbharta in space manufacturing... So all these things are connected in the same way.” To this, PM Modi said, “If we do it self-reliantly, we will do well.” Shukla returned to Earth on July 15 after a three-week stay aboard the International Space Station during NASA’s Axiom-4 mission, which launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on June 25. He splashed down off the coast of California and arrived in New Delhi on Sunday. His mission made him the first Indian since Rakesh Sharma in 1984 to travel to space.WATCH FULL VIDEOAbout the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Supreme Court questions toll fees on Kerala highway; slams NHAI over poor roadsTOI News Desk / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Updated: Aug 19, 2025, 12:06 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLarge Supreme Court (Image credits: ANI) NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday slammed toll collection on dilapidated highways that leave commuters stranded, remarking that commuters pay despite suffering long delays, drawing parallel to the national capital, noting few hours of rain can bring Delhi to a standstill.A bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justices K Vinod Chandran and N V Anjaria made the observation while hearing appeals filed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and concessionaire Guruvayoor Infrastructure. The appeals challenge a Kerala high court order that suspended toll collection at the Paliyekkara toll plaza in Thrissur for four weeks over the poor condition of the Edappally–Mannuthy stretch of National Highway 544 and severe traffic congestion from ongoing works."Why should a person pay Rs 150 if it takes 12 hours for him to get from one end of the road to the other end? A road which is expected to take one hour, takes 11 more hours and they have to pay a toll as well,” the CJI said, as quoted by PTI.PollIn your opinion, should toll fees be adjusted during severe traffic delays?Yes, definitelyNo, they should remain the sameSolicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for NHAI, argued that the jam had been caused by a lorry overturning, which he described as an “act of God.” Justice Chandran disagreed, saying, “The accident which triggered the block was not a mere act of God but caused by a lorry toppling into a pothole.” Mehta added that service roads had been provided and blamed monsoon rains for slowing work, suggesting proportionate toll reduction instead of suspension. Justice Chandran, however, remarked that a 12-hour ordeal went far beyond proportional adjustment, reported PTI.“In Delhi, you know what happens... if it rains for two hours, the entire city gets paralysed,” the bench also observed, underscoring the plight of commuters on poorly maintained roads.Senior advocate Jayant Muthraj, appearing for the original petitioners, argued that NHAI had the responsibility to ensure a motorable road and that collecting toll amid such conditions violated public trust. He said the high court had suspended toll collection only as a last resort after earlier interim directions.The high court’s August 6 order held that motorists could not be charged when highways were badly maintained and congestion severe, stressing that the NHAI–public relationship was one of “public trust.”The Supreme Court has reserved its verdict on the case.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

In several cases, it proposes to introduce "improvement notices" for first-time violations, replacing fines with penalties and giving violators an opportunity to rectify their non-compliance.Introducing the bill, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said it seeks to enhance trust-based governance for ease of doing business. The bill was referred to the select committee of LS for scrutiny, which is to submit its report by the first day of the next session of Parliament.The Bill seeks to simplify 355 provisions - decriminalising 288 provisions and amending 67. It uses the term "contraventions" instead of "offence" to give an opportunity to violators to mend their ways. It proposes to rationalise penalties for repeat violations.PollShould imprisonment be removed for minor offences according to the new bill?Yes, it makes sense.No, it should remain.Officials said the bill reflects a shift from the earlier approach of "penalise on first detection" to a "warning-correct-penalise" model, which would promote voluntary compliance. For deterrence, a steep hike in penalties has been proposed for second and subsequent violations in several cases.For example, in the Central Silk Board Act, 1948, the bill proposes to replace the provision of imprisonment of up to one year and up to Rs 1,000 fine to "warning" for first contravention while for subsequent violations the proposed penalty has been hiked manifold (Rs 25,000-1 lakh) for furnishing any false statement. Similarly, the proposed penalty for manufacturing and sale of Ayurvedic, Siddha or Unani drugs in contravention to the provision of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act is three times more. As per the bill, the provision of up to six months' jail and fine of at least Rs 10,000 would be replaced with only fine of at least Rs 30,000.The bill proposes to amend provisions related to sectors such as agriculture export, industries, transport, electricity, municipal services, textile and coir. It states that the fear of imprisonment for minor offences is a "major factor" hampering the business ecosystem and individual confidence.The legislation proposes to amend 20 provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act to provide relaxation and clarity in compliance, including statewide vehicle registration instead of jurisdiction-specific; driving licence (DL) renewal effective from date of renewal if applied after expiry; 30 days grace period after licence expiry; reporting period for vehicle registration cancellation extended to 30 days from 14; and insurer intimation period on transfer of insurance certificate extended to 30 days from 14.However, for stricter action against air-pollution, the bill proposes Rs 10,000 fine and disqualification to hold DL for first offence while jail and penalty for subsequent offence. This proposes to set a 12-month timeline for claims tribunals to dispose of accident related cases.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousTaarak Mehta’s Sunayana Fozdar’s top 10 ethnic lookstv'Coolie' actress Rachita Ram's most gorgeous picturesEntertainmentPreity Mukhundhan radiates eleganceEntertainmentNeha Harsora’s dazzling and dreamy ethnic lookstvBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning weekend looks of the contestantstvFun facts about the Param Sundari actor Sidharth MalhotraEntertainment8 simple habits that will help reduce stress on the eyes and improve vision naturallyLifestyle8 times Samantha Ruth Prabhu turned perfect muse for Krésha BajajLifestyleSaree tales by actress Nisha RavikrishnantvManasi Parekh Serves Style & SmilesEntertainment Next123 Photostories  When Bollywood dared to break silence on social injusticeFrom 68.5 to 55 kg in Just 45 Days: Sunita Gogoi shares the discipline behind her 13 kg weight loss journeySmiles replace tensions as Zelenskyy visits Trump: EU, Nato leaders rally at White House - photos10 lesser known health benefits of eating cardamomWhy Ganga aarti is performed every evening: Understanding its spiritual significanceHow to make Chia Seed and Coconut Oil hair mask for quick hair growthBrown bread vs multigrain bread vs white bread, which is worse?Power passports: Citizens of these 5 countries can enter 185+ nations visa-free or on arrivalHow to build a timeless wardrobe inspired by Meryl StreepMovies that capture the strength of smiling through pain123Hot PicksCP RadhakrishnanMumbai RainsHurricane Erin 2025Brooklyn Nightclub ShootingMarco RubioCrimeaBank Holidays AugustTop TrendingPatrick MahomesAntonio BrownRaheem MorrisJoy TaylorTravis Hunters WifeOlivia Paige DunneMartina NavratilovaMarco BelinelliPatrick MahomesTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteINDIA bloc continues SIR protest: Telangana Congress demands urea for farmers; ruckus adjourns parliamentHow 'India’s secrets' helped Shubhanshu Shukla in space: Astronaut shares experience with PM Modi - WatchWhy should one pay to spend 12 hours in traffic jams?

Twenty tourists sat trapped in Ranthambore's Zone-6 - a 25sqkm territory locals call "three-tiger country". Time: 6pm. Darkness set in and the forest closed in. Panic spread. Parents whispered words of comfort to shush their crying children.For an hour and 45 minutes Saturday evening, the group remained stranded. Among those stuck was a seven-month-old child. Their guide allegedly deserted them, taking a lift out with another vehicle. By 7pm, no relief had come.With no mobile network to summon help, tourist Mohit hailed another vehicle returning from a trip. There's room for only one. He reached the main gate and begged for help. At the chowki, staff told him it wasn't their responsibility.PollWhat is your opinion on the guide's responsibility in this incident?The guide should be held accountable.The guide should not be blamed.A Canter driver allegedly demanded full payment before agreeing to assist.Rescue finally arrived around 7.45pm. The replacement Canter had no working headlights. The driver steered through the jungle with a torch. Children cried as the forest went pitch black. An audio recording of a woman tourist's call, made after she reached safety, recounted the ordeal. "Fortunately, no wild animal appeared," she said. Ranthambore is home to 70 tigers and about 130 leopards.The broken Canter may have spared its passengers a brush with the wild - but it left the national park's safari system fully exposed. A senior official said Sunday the truck broke down during the evening safari. Another Canter, meant to be on standby at the chowki, was absent. A third Canter, which had already returned, was instructed to bring the marooned group but failed to follow orders. Forest department banned all three Canter drivers and the accompanying guide until further orders. An inquiry has been ordered, with the assistant conservator of forests (tourism) directed to submit a report in three days.The department also reviewed the age and condition of safari vehicles. Ranthambore currently has 556 registered vehicles for tourism: 269 Gypsies and 287 Canters. Authorised vehicles are either locally owned and registered with the forest department or department-owned, with private operators managing bookings.Hoteliers and conservation stakeholders warned that many Canters are in rundown condition. "Some owners avoid spending on maintenance... expecting the vehicles will be phased out," a tour operator said Monday.

Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla calls on PM Modi at his 7, Lok Kalyan Marg residence on Monday NEW DELHI: Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, the first Indian astronaut to go to the International Space Station (ISS), was embraced by PM Narendra Modi when the country’s spaceman called on him at his 7, Lok Kalyan Marg residence after his successful mission to space.Shukla aka Shux, who arrived in India on Sunday from the US, was patted on the back by the PM for successfully piloting the Axiom-4 mission. He shared pictures of the Earth clicked from ISS with the PM and also shared his experience about the mission and zero-gravity experiments he did in space with Modi.After his one-to-one meet, Modi posted on X, “Had a great interaction with Shubhanshu Shukla. We discussed a wide range of subjects including his experiences in space, progress in science & technology as well as India's ambitious Gaganyaan mission. India is proud of his feat.”A day before, Shukla, who returned from the US after an 18-day space mission on ISS, was given a warm welcome at the IGI airport by space minister Jitendra Singh, Delhi CM Rekha Gupta and a large crowd waving the national flag.Earlier in the day, Parliament honoured the IAF pilot-turned Indian astronaut. The discussion was filled with praise and a strong sense of national pride, even as opposition parties staged a boycott. “Shubhanshu Shukla’s space travel and safe return is not just a successful mission, but a moment of pride for the entire nation and inspiration for the youth,” LS Speaker Om Birla said. Parliament described Shukla’s achievement as a new chapter in India’s space exploration, noting that it not only advanced homegrown science but also inspired a generation of young Indians to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and space.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous'Coolie' actress Rachita Ram's most gorgeous picturesEntertainmentPreity Mukhundhan radiates eleganceEntertainmentNeha Harsora’s dazzling and dreamy ethnic lookstvBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning weekend looks of the contestantstvFun facts about the Param Sundari actor Sidharth MalhotraEntertainment8 simple habits that will help reduce stress on the eyes and improve vision naturallyLifestyle8 times Samantha Ruth Prabhu turned perfect muse for Krésha BajajLifestyleSaree tales by actress Nisha RavikrishnantvManasi Parekh Serves Style & SmilesEntertainment10 celebrity-inspired Indian baby boy namesLifestyle Next123 Photostories  10 lesser known health benefits of eating cardamomWhy Ganga aarti is performed every evening: Understanding its spiritual significanceHow to make Chia Seed and Coconut Oil hair mask for quick hair growthBrown bread vs multigrain bread vs white bread, which is worse?Power passports: Citizens of these 5 countries can enter 185+ nations visa-free or on arrivalHow to build a timeless wardrobe inspired by Meryl StreepMovies that capture the strength of smiling through painHigh uric acid levels linked to high BP, diabetes and heart disease: Early symptoms to watch forWorld Photography Day 2025: Explore India’s most photogenic Blue Flag beachesIncredible India: Know all about the pride and joy of Puneri Pagadis123Hot PicksCP RadhakrishnanMumbai RainsHurricane Erin 2025Brooklyn Nightclub ShootingMarco RubioCrimeaBank Holidays AugustTop TrendingPatrick MahomesAntonio BrownRaheem MorrisJoy TaylorTravis Hunters WifeOlivia Paige DunneMartina NavratilovaMarco BelinelliPatrick MahomesTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteHow 'India’s secrets' helped Shubhanshu Shukla in space: Astronaut shares experience with PM Modi - WatchWhy should one pay to spend 12 hours in traffic jams?

The apex court is likely to hear the plea this week.In June, the HC had directed the Centre to resume the rural employment programme in the state from Aug 1, saying the scheme could not be "put in cold storage for eternity". The scheme has been suspended in Bengal for nearly three years, with the Centre blocking the funds due to alleged irregularities and non-compliance with its directives.Refusing to buy the Centre's argument on fake job card holders, Chief Justice T S Sivagnanam had said, "A person who obtained wages illegally or under fictitious names could not go free and had to be dealt with firmly.

"Has any database been compiled to show how many youngsters who turned 18 on the qualifying date were included?"Stalin voiced apprehension that procedures for enquiry and two appeals under Registration of Electors Rules, 1960, may exclude a huge number of voters in the impending Bihar polls. "Is EC going to address this issue? Will EC take these practical difficulties into account while conducting SIR in other states," he asked.The CM demanded that EC scrap SIR in other states, particularly Tamil Nadu, and urged DMK functionaries to be wary of addition or deletion of voters in the state ahead of the assembly polls next year.Stalin reminded EC about a DMK petition of July 17 seeking deletion of deceased voters. "When will this be done?" he asked. He wondered what prevented EC from enlisting Aadhaar as an acceptable documents to prove a voter's claims. "If free and fair elections are truly EC's aim, why can't it be more transparent and voter-friendly?"End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousPreity Mukhundhan radiates eleganceEntertainmentNeha Harsora’s dazzling and dreamy ethnic lookstvBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning weekend looks of the contestantstvFun facts about the Param Sundari actor Sidharth MalhotraEntertainment8 simple habits that will help reduce stress on the eyes and improve vision naturallyLifestyle8 times Samantha Ruth Prabhu turned perfect muse for Krésha BajajLifestyleSaree tales by actress Nisha RavikrishnantvManasi Parekh Serves Style & SmilesEntertainment10 celebrity-inspired Indian baby boy namesLifestyle10 animals that look like they are hand paintedLifestyle Next123 Photostories  How to build a timeless wardrobe inspired by Meryl StreepMovies that capture the strength of smiling through painHigh uric acid levels linked to high BP, diabetes and heart disease: Early symptoms to watch forWorld Photography Day 2025: Explore India’s most photogenic Blue Flag beachesIncredible India: Know all about the pride and joy of Puneri PagadisUrvashi Rautela turns heads with glamorous outfitBig-city girl reunites with first love in timeless Bollywood romanceKajol’s entry redefined the idea of a heroine on screenBigg Boss Telugu 9: Meet the judges of the pre-show, “Agnipariksha”Jab We Met, Bareilly Ki Barfi, Mujhse Shaadi Karogi: Binge these rom-com hits on OTT before Param Sundari123Hot PicksCP RadhakrishnanMumbai RainsHurricane Erin 2025Brooklyn Nightclub ShootingMarco RubioCrimeaBank Holidays AugustTop TrendingPatrick MahomesAntonio BrownRaheem MorrisJoy TaylorTravis Hunters WifeOlivia Paige DunneMartina NavratilovaMarco BelinelliPatrick MahomesTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteAsked to break up, Bihar couple dies by suicideFlyer arrested in Chennai for smoking onboardSC skeptical about involving HC CJ in state DGP selectionHC sees red as Assam hands over 3k bigha of land to cement companyHusband taking part in selection of AMU's 1st woman VC not proper: SCEx-Kashmir bar prez charged under UAPANoel Tata’s mother and former Tata Group director Simone Tata in critical conditionIntent to drive a person to death must for abetment conviction: SCGovt orders schools' safety audits, directs demolition of unsafe buildingsUnemployment rate slows to 5.2% in July: PLFS dataIndia Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Shubman Gill dilemma - Selectors face tough call ahead of Asia Cup squad announcementRow over Indian-origin truck driver Harjinder Singh: California Guv's office says he entered US under Trump presidency'Scared to go back to India': Truck driver Harjinder Singh who killed 3 in Florida was allowed to stay in US in 2018 on $5,000 bondStephen Curry’s wife Ayesha Curry shares an unforgettable moment of baby Cai walking on his dad’s footstepsVanessa Bryant finally breaks silence on wild pregnancy rumors with a wild response featuring a Rihanna meme'If you are trying to brain-drain Bangalore...': US economist's H-1B explanation goes viralAre Travis Hunter and Leanna Lenee really divorcing?

To this, CJI Gavai asked, "To what extent does the SC have the competence to go beyond legislation enacted by states for selection of DGPs? If the HC CJ is made part of the selection process, which is part of the executive's function, would it not breach constitutionally mandated separation of powers between legislature, executive and judiciary?"The SC rejected contempt pleas against Jharkhand for appointing Anurag Gupta as DGP.

HC sees red as Assam hands over 3k bigha of land to cement company

Gauhati HC GUWAHATI: A contentious mining lease granted to a private cement company for 3,000 bighas (4.01 sq km) in Assam's Dima Hasao district led an incredulous Gauhati high court judge to question on camera if it was "some kind of joke or what" that "public interest" had been sacrificed at the altar of business."The entire district? What is going on? 3,000 bighas allotted to a private company? What kind of decision is this?" Justice Sanjay Kumar Medhi is heard saying in courtroom footage, seemingly taken aback by a counsel's submission on the parcel of land at stake. When the lawyer representing Mahabal Cement Ltd argues that the disputed area near Umrangso "is barren land", Justice Medhi interjects, "We know how barren is NC Hills (Dima Hasao's erstwhile name)." Seconds later, the judge is seen rebuking the lawyer again just as she picks up a sheaf of documents in preparation for further arguments."No, no, your lordship, we need it (the land). It's because of..." the counsel says before Justice Medhi interrupts her."Your need is not the issue, madam. Public interest is the issue," the judge says.The high court was hearing two petitions - one filed by Dima Hasao resident Sonesh Hojai and 21 others against the state govt and Mahabal Cement Ltd, and another by the company against the state govt and 10 others. Dima Hasao, one among six tribal-dominant districts of the state, is a biodiverse region famous for its hot springs, forests, migratory bird habitats and wildlife. As mandated by the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, an elected autonomous council administers the district.Justice Medhi has directed the North Cachar Hills Autonomous Council's standing counsel, C Sarma, to "obtain records containing the policy to allot such a huge chunk of land to a factory" and submit these to the court at the next hearing. "The direction has been given by taking into account that the district is a 6th Scheduled district under the Constitution of India, where the priority has to be given to the rights and interest of the tribal people residing there," stated the order.A video of the judge's exchange with the company's lawyer has been widely shared on social media.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousPreity Mukhundhan radiates eleganceEntertainmentNeha Harsora’s dazzling and dreamy ethnic lookstvBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning weekend looks of the contestantstvFun facts about the Param Sundari actor Sidharth MalhotraEntertainment8 simple habits that will help reduce stress on the eyes and improve vision naturallyLifestyle8 times Samantha Ruth Prabhu turned perfect muse for Krésha BajajLifestyleSaree tales by actress Nisha RavikrishnantvManasi Parekh Serves Style & SmilesEntertainment10 celebrity-inspired Indian baby boy namesLifestyle10 animals that look like they are hand paintedLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Movies that capture the strength of smiling through painHigh uric acid levels linked to high BP, diabetes and heart disease: Early symptoms to watch forWorld Photography Day 2025: Explore India’s most photogenic Blue Flag beachesIncredible India: Know all about the pride and joy of Puneri PagadisUrvashi Rautela turns heads with glamorous outfitBig-city girl reunites with first love in timeless Bollywood romanceKajol’s entry redefined the idea of a heroine on screenBigg Boss Telugu 9: Meet the judges of the pre-show, “Agnipariksha”Jab We Met, Bareilly Ki Barfi, Mujhse Shaadi Karogi: Binge these rom-com hits on OTT before Param Sundari'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' to 'Annabelle': Horror movies to binge watch on OTT before 'The Conjuring: Last Rites' releases123Hot PicksCP RadhakrishnanMumbai RainsHurricane Erin 2025Brooklyn Nightclub ShootingMarco RubioCrimeaBank Holidays AugustTop TrendingPatrick MahomesAntonio BrownRaheem MorrisJoy TaylorTravis Hunters WifeOlivia Paige DunneMartina NavratilovaMarco BelinelliPatrick MahomesTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteIndia Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Shubman Gill dilemma - Selectors face tough call ahead of Asia Cup squad announcementRow over Indian-origin truck driver Harjinder Singh: California Guv's office says he entered US under Trump presidency'Scared to go back to India': Truck driver Harjinder Singh who killed 3 in Florida was allowed to stay in US in 2018 on $5,000 bondStephen Curry’s wife Ayesha Curry shares an unforgettable moment of baby Cai walking on his dad’s footstepsVanessa Bryant finally breaks silence on wild pregnancy rumors with a wild response featuring a Rihanna meme'If you are trying to brain-drain Bangalore...': US economist's H-1B explanation goes viralAre Travis Hunter and Leanna Lenee really divorcing?

Husband taking part in selection of AMU's 1st woman VC not proper: SC
The Supreme Court questioned the selection process of Naima Khatoon as AMU's VC, highlighting her husband's involvement as improper. Despite Allahabad HC's disapproval but eventual upholding of her selection, the apex court raised concerns about fairness. The hearing was adjourned due to Justice Chandran's recusal, while arguments continued regarding the validity of the selection process and potential manipulation.

Despite Allahabad HC's disapproval but eventual upholding of her selection, the apex court raised concerns about fairness. The hearing was adjourned due to Justice Chandran's recusal, while arguments continued regarding the validity of the selection process and potential manipulation.  NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday made adverse comments on the selection process that led to the appointment of Naima Khatoon as the first woman vice-chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), saying the participation of her husband Mohd Gulrez, the officiating vice-chancellor, in the process was not proper.A bench of CJI Bhushan R Gavai and Justices K Vinod Chandran and N V Anjaria said, "Certainly, the husband's participation in the selection process is not proper when his wife is a candidate. He should have recused and made his deputy participate in it. The selection process should not only be fair but also appear to be fair".The remarks came on appeals filed against a judgment of Allahabad HC, which too had disapproved of the participation of Khatoon's husband in the selection process, but upheld her selection by the President, who is the visitor of the university, as the vice-chancellor of AMU. Appearing for the petitioners, senior advocate Kapil Sibal explained how voting in the executive council was tailored to insert Khatoon's name into the panel of five names - Faizan Mustafa, Qayyum Husain, Muzaffar Uruj Rabbani and Furqan Qamar were the other candidates - for the purpose. When these names were placed before the AMU Court (Senate), Rabbani got 61 votes, Mustafa, 50 votes, and Khatoon, 50 votes. These three names were sent to the President of India, who chose Khatoon as VC, and she was appointed to the post in Apr last year.Despite the CJI's adverse comments, the court adjourned the hearing as Justice Chandran recused himself, on the ground that as chancellor he had recommended the appointment of Faizan Mustafa as the VC of Chanakya National Law University, Patna.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said Justice Chandran need not recuse himself as the parties had full faith in him. He held that Gulrez's participation in the selection process did not affect the sanctity of Prof Khatoon's appointment as AMU VC as her name was included in the panel of three names by the AMU Court.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati told the bench that the selection process had followed the rules and regulations scrupulously and that the high court, after examining the allegations, had upheld her appointment as the AMU vice-chancellor. Sibal said he had no issues with the Visitor's choice, but if the allegations of manipulation were examined and found true, then Khatoon's name would not have figured on the list of five names forwarded to the AMU court by the executive council.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousPreity Mukhundhan radiates eleganceEntertainmentNeha Harsora’s dazzling and dreamy ethnic lookstvBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning weekend looks of the contestantstvFun facts about the Param Sundari actor Sidharth MalhotraEntertainment8 simple habits that will help reduce stress on the eyes and improve vision naturallyLifestyle8 times Samantha Ruth Prabhu turned perfect muse for Krésha BajajLifestyleSaree tales by actress Nisha RavikrishnantvManasi Parekh Serves Style & SmilesEntertainment10 celebrity-inspired Indian baby boy namesLifestyle10 animals that look like they are hand paintedLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Movies that capture the strength of smiling through painHigh uric acid levels linked to high BP, diabetes and heart disease: Early symptoms to watch forWorld Photography Day 2025: Explore India’s most photogenic Blue Flag beachesIncredible India: Know all about the pride and joy of Puneri PagadisUrvashi Rautela turns heads with glamorous outfitBig-city girl reunites with first love in timeless Bollywood romanceKajol’s entry redefined the idea of a heroine on screenBigg Boss Telugu 9: Meet the judges of the pre-show, “Agnipariksha”Jab We Met, Bareilly Ki Barfi, Mujhse Shaadi Karogi: Binge these rom-com hits on OTT before Param Sundari'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' to 'Annabelle': Horror movies to binge watch on OTT before 'The Conjuring: Last Rites' releases123Hot PicksCP RadhakrishnanMumbai RainsHurricane Erin 2025Brooklyn Nightclub ShootingMarco RubioCrimeaBank Holidays AugustTop TrendingPatrick MahomesAntonio BrownRaheem MorrisJoy TaylorTravis Hunters WifeOlivia Paige DunneMartina NavratilovaMarco BelinelliPatrick MahomesTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteEx-Kashmir bar prez charged under UAPANoel Tata’s mother and former Tata Group director Simone Tata in critical conditionIntent to drive a person to death must for abetment conviction: SCGovt orders schools' safety audits, directs demolition of unsafe buildingsUnemployment rate slows to 5.2% in July: PLFS dataGovt moves to expedite green nod for mining critical mineralsNehru signed IWT without consulting Parliament: NaddaBill in LS to tag IIM-G 'institute of national importance'China & India should meet each other halfway: BeijingPutin, Modi reaffirm vow to strengthen bilateral tiesRow over Indian-origin truck driver Harjinder Singh: California Guv's office says he entered US under Trump presidency'Scared to go back to India': Truck driver Harjinder Singh who killed 3 in Florida was allowed to stay in US in 2018 on $5,000 bondStephen Curry’s wife Ayesha Curry shares an unforgettable moment of baby Cai walking on his dad’s footstepsVanessa Bryant finally breaks silence on wild pregnancy rumors with a wild response featuring a Rihanna meme'If you are trying to brain-drain Bangalore...': US economist's H-1B explanation goes viralAre Travis Hunter and Leanna Lenee really divorcing?

She was flown from Dubai to Mumbai. Doctor Farokh Udwadia is attending to her. Simone, 95, has Parkinson's symptoms. She transformed Lakme into a famous brand. She created Westside after Lakme's sale. She managed Tata's consumer businesses for four decades. Noel succeeded Ratan at Tata Trusts. Simone Tata made a rare public appearance at the launch of the revamped flagship Westside store in South Mumbai in October 2019. MUMBAI: Simone Tata, the mother of Tata Trusts chairman Noel Tata, is in critical condition at the Breach Candy Hospital, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told TOI. She was airlifted from Dubai to Mumbai on Monday and is under the care of doctor Farokh Udwadia. Simone, 95, is fighting several symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, the same illness that her stepson and former Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata passed away from last October. “She and Noel arrived in Mumbai from Dubai on a medical plane at Terminal 8,” the sources said. Simone is most famous for turning the Lakmé cosmetic brand into a well-known household name in India. The name Lakmé comes from the French word for Lakshmi, a goddess known for her beauty in Hindu mythology. The Tata Group was urged by former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to launch a makeup brand after learning that Indian women were spending the country’s foreign reserves on Western makeup brands. Lakmé was established by the Tata Group in 1952. Originally from Geneva, Switzerland, Simone first visited India as a tourist in the summer of 1953 at the age of 23. During her visit, she met Naval Tata, who was 26 years her senior and divorced from his first wife Soonoo. They fell in love, got married in 1955, and she decided to make Mumbai her permanent home. In 1996, the Tata Group sold Lakmé to Hindustan Unilever as part of a restructuring strategy. Simone used the proceeds from the sale to create Westside, a popular department store where many Indians shop. She managed the Tata Group’s consumer-facing businesses including Lakme and Trent (which owns Westside and Star India Bazaar stores) for over four decades until her retirement in 2006. She also served on the board of Tata Industries, an important investment company within the Tata Group. After her retirement, Simone made fewer public appearances. In October 2019, she was seen in a wheelchair at the opening of the renovated flagship Westside store in South Mumbai. In September 2022, she attended the funeral of former Tata Group chairman Cyrus Mistry (Noel is married to Cyrus’s sister Aloo Mistry), and in October 2024, she was present at Ratan’s funeral.Following Ratan’s passing, Noel took over his position at Tata Trusts, the driving force behind the $180-billion Tata Group.About the AuthorReeba ZachariahReeba Zachariah is assistant corporate editor at The Times of India, Mumbai.
