Instead of photos of Ukrainian children suffering the war that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy brought to the White House in February, this time Zelenskyy brought a letter from Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska addressed to First Lady Melania Trump and offered it to Donald Trump at the beginning of their joint sit-down Monday. This was taking a leaf out of the recent example set by Trump himself who hand-delivered Melania's letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Zelenskyy praised the gesture and then took out the letter from his wife and specified that the letter was not meant for Trump. "Thank you very much for your efforts, personal efforts to stop the killings and stop this war," Zelenskyy said, adding that Melania's letter mentioned Ukraine's children. “My wife, the first lady of Ukraine, she gave the letter. It’s not to you but to your wife,” he said"I want," Trump said in his instant reaction.What Melania wrote in her letter to Trump"In today's world, some children are forced to carry a quiet laughter, untouched by the darkness around them," Melania wrote. "Mr Putin, you can singlehandedly restore their melodic laughter," it added. "In protecting the innocence of these children, you will do more than serve Russia alone -- you serve humanity itself.""Such a bold idea transcends all human division, and you, Mr Putin, are fit to implement this vision with a stroke of the pen today," the letter read. "It is time."During Monday's press conference, Trump spoke about Melania;s letter to Putin, urging him to protect children amid the push to end his war in Ukraine, and said it was “very well received” by the Russian leader. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, alongside Zelenskyy that Melania “loves children and she hates to see something like this happening.” “She would love to see this end,” Trump said. “She says it very openly, very proudly, and with great sorrow.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
