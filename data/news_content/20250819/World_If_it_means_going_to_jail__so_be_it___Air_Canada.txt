(AP) The strike by over 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants entered its third day on Monday, leaving hundreds of thousands of passengers stranded amid the peak summer travel season. The Canada Industrial Relations Board (CIRB) had declared the stoppage illegal and ordered workers back to their posts, but the union has refused to comply. CUPE National President Mark Hancock, speaking at a briefing on Monday, signaled the union’s determination. “There's no limit. We're going to stay strong. We're going to stay committed to making sure that those workers can do the job they love doing and actually be able to afford a roof over their heads, to afford caring for their families,” he said. “And if it means folks like me going to jail, then so be it. If it means our union being fined, then so be it. We're looking for a solution here. Our members want a solution here. But that solution has to be found at a bargaining table.” Flight attendants walked off the job early Saturday after rejecting Air Canada’s request to enter government-directed arbitration, which would allow a third party to determine contract terms. Hancock publicly tore up a copy of the initial back-to-work order outside Toronto’s Pearson International Airport, to the cheers of picketing workers. Air Canada has warned staff that those defying the order may be held personally accountable. The airline suspended plans to restart operations Sunday evening after the union refused to return to work, affecting about 130,000 passengers daily. Prime Minister Mark Carney urged both sides to resolve the dispute quickly. “We are in a situation where literally hundreds of thousands of Canadians and visitors to our country are being disrupted by this action,” he said, emphasizing the need for fair compensation and a resolution. The union is demanding wages comparable to those at Air Transat and pay for work on the ground, such as boarding passengers. Air Canada’s offer included a 38% increase in total compensation over four years, but CUPE rejected it, citing insufficient first-year raises against inflation. With no immediate sign of compromise, the standoff is expected to continue, leaving passengers uncertain and the government weighing potential legal or legislative measures to end the strike.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
