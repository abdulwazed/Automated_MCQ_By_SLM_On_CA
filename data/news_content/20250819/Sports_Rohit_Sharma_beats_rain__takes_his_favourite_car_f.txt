Rohit Sharma NEW DELHI: Not even heavy Mumbai rains can keep Rohit Sharma indoors. The Indian cricket star was recently spotted driving his sleek black Range Rover through the city, enjoying the monsoon showers in style.The Range Rover is one of Rohit’s trusted rides, but it’s far from the only head-turner in his enviable garage. Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!EXCLUSIVE | Harbhajan Singh on Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Shubman Gill, India vs Pakistan and moreJust a couple of days ago, the 37-year-old added a fiery red Lamborghini Urus SE to his growing luxury car collection and wasted no time taking it out for a drive. Fans quickly gathered on the streets of Mumbai as Rohit, behind the wheel of the brand-new SUV, cruised through the city.What caught everyone’s attention, apart from the stunning machine itself, was the personalised number plate — 3015. The digits carry deep personal meaning, combining his daughter Samaira’s birthday (December 30) and son Ahaan’s birthday (November 15). Together, the numbers add up to 45, Rohit’s iconic jersey number. His previous car carried the number 264, a nod to his world-record ODI score against Sri Lanka in 2014.The Urus SE itself is a beast on wheels, packing 800hp and 950Nm of torque, capable of hitting 0–100 km/h in just 3.4 seconds. Priced at around Rs 4.57 crore (ex-showroom), it is the latest jewel in a collection that also includes a BMW M5 (Rs 1.99 crore), Mercedes-Benz GLS 400d (Rs 1.58 crore), Mercedes-Benz S-Class (Rs 1.98 crore), and a Range Rover HSE LWB (Rs 3.68 crore).WATCH:While his garage continues to expand, Rohit’s cricketing journey is entering a decisive phase. Having last turned out for the Mumbai Indians in IPL 2025, he is gearing up for what could be his final international series. With the Bangladesh ODIs in August cancelled, India’s next assignment will be a three-match ODI series in Australia from October 19–25, where Rohit is expected to make a return.For now, the former India captain seems to be striking the perfect balance — working hard on his cricket while enjoying life off the field, whether it’s in the nets or behind the wheel of his favourite cars.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
