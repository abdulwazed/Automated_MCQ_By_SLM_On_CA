Rajinikanth's 'Coolie' is making waves at the North American box office, grossing USD 6.22 million in five days, nearing 'Chhaava's' total earnings. Despite mixed word-of-mouth and dipping daily collections, 'Coolie' showcases Rajinikanth's star power and the global appeal of Tamil cinema. In India, 'Coolie' faces collection drops, while 'Chhaava's' success highlights the diverse genres thriving abroad. Superstar Rajinikanth has once again proven his unmatched global appeal with his latest release Coolie, which has stormed the North American box office. The film has grossed an impressive USD 6.22 million in just five days, making it the second-biggest Indian film of 2025 in the region, second only to Chhaava.What makes this feat extraordinary is the pace at which Coolie has scaled these heights. While Chhaava, starring Vicky Kaushal, Rashmika Mandanna, and Akshaye Khanna, earned USD 6.4 million over its entire theatrical run, Coolie has nearly touched that figure within its first 5 days and now needs another USD 200K to breach that amount. While the film earned over USD 3 million just from its premiere shows, the word of mouth on the film isn't exactly great and hence its daily collections are dipping. It now all depends on the coming weekend if the film picks up again or not. The break-even point for the film has been pegged at USD 7.5 million which is still far away as the initial buzz and excitement for the film is over.‘Coolie’ release sparks madness: Rajinikanth fans dance and flood theatres in Tamil NaduIn India as well Coolie has been seeing a drop in it’s collection as in 5 days the film has collected a little over Rs 206 crore. The number in isolation looks big but given the star power attached to the film from Lokesh Kanagaraj to Nagarjuna to Upendra to Shruti Haasan to Aamir Khan, the number does not justify the scale. Chhaava, directed by Laxman Utekar, had been considered one of the surprise North American success stories of 2025. Its lifetime earnings of USD 6.4 million had set a benchmark for Bollywood films this year. While Coolie is now on the verge of overtaking that tally in less than a week underlines Rajinikanth’s unparalleled star power and the widening scope of Tamil blockbusters overseas but it will be a while before the film starts making profits for its distributors..Interestingly, the competition between Coolie and Chhaava also highlights how diverse genres of Indian cinema are thriving abroad. While Chhaava rode on historical grandeur and star-studded performances, Coolie has gone the other way delivering raw, massy entertainment that appeals directly to audiences looking for high-octane thrills on the big screen."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Ashwin Kumar's mythological epic, 'Mahavatar Narsimha,' has become a box office success, grossing ₹161.1 crore in 25 days. It's now the sixth highest-grossing Hindi film of 2025 and may surpass Aamir Khan's 'Sitaare Zameen Par.' Despite facing competition, the film's strong performance, driven by positive word-of-mouth and cultural resonance, highlights the power of content-driven storytelling in Bollywood. Ashwin Kumar’s mythological epic Mahavatar Narsimha has scripted a remarkable success story at the Hindi box office. After a steady 25-day run, the film has collected Rs 161.1 crore net, officially making it the sixth highest-grossing Hindi film of 2025 so far. What’s more, with Aamir Khan’s Sitaare Zameen Par standing just ahead at Rs 166.18 crore, trade believes Mahavatar Narsimha could well challenge for the fifth spot by the coming weekend as the animation film was able to survive the clash between Rajinikanth’s Coolie and Hrithik Roshan-Jr NTR’s War 2 and both films are now losing audience with each passing day.The year 2025 has been crowded with big-ticket Hindi releases, ranging from historical dramas to comedies and sequels. The top five at the moment include Chhaava (Rs 585.7 crore), Saiyaara (Rs 324.67 crore), Housefull 5 (Rs 183.88 crore), Raid 2 (Rs 173.44 crore), and Sitaare Zameen Par (Rs 166.18 crore). For Mahavatar Narsimha a film without an A-list star headlining it breaking into this list is a feat in itself.The film opened modestly with Rs 1.35 crore on Day 1in Hindi, but its collections grew quickly as positive word-of-mouth spread and it ended week 1 on Rs 32.45 crore. By Week 2 the film added another Rs 54.95 crore to its kitty. During Week 3 the collections remained steady as it added another Rs 53.75 crore to its tally and during the fourth weekend it minted Rs 18.45 crore. On Monday the film earned another Rs 1.5 crore, taking the overall Hindi collection of the film to Rs 161.1 crore as per Sacnilk, while the overall collection of the film stands at Rs 212.6 crore Such box office stamina indicates that the film has connected deeply with audiences, particularly in the Hindi heartland, where mythological stories continue to hold immense cultural resonance.At its current total of Rs 161.1 crore, Mahavatar Narsimha is just Rs 5 crore short of overtaking Sitaare Zameen Par. Given its present trend of Rs 1-2 crore weekday earnings and higher weekend jumps, trade believes the crossover could happen within the next few days. If that occurs, Ashwin Kumar’s directorial will climb to the 5th position among 2025’s Hindi blockbusters, displacing an Aamir Khan starrer, no small achievement for a film led by content rather than sheer star power.The film’s success can be attributed to multiple factors. The mythological theme, blending spirituality with cinematic spectacle, has resonated with family audiences. With Rs 161.1 crore already in its kitty, Mahavatar Narsimha has not just surprised trade pundits but also cemented Ashwin Kumar’s place as a filmmaker to watch. The coming weekend will be crucial—if the film overtakes Sitaare Zameen Par, it will rewrite the rankings yet again and prove that content-driven storytelling still has the power to challenge Bollywood’s biggest stars at the box office."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

The romantic drama has crossed USD 6 million in North America. It is now the third highest-grossing Indian film there. Saiyaara added nearly a million dollars in just 13 days. It is the second-highest-grossing Hindi film in North America. Mohit Suri's Saiyaara, starring Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda, is a hit overseas. The romantic drama has crossed USD 6 million in North America. It is now the third highest-grossing Indian film there. Saiyaara added nearly a million dollars in just 13 days. It is the second-highest-grossing Hindi film in North America. Mohit Suri’s Saiyaara, featuring newcomers Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda, has emerged as one of the biggest success stories of Indian cinema overseas this year. The romantic drama, which opened to warm word-of-mouth in India and abroad, has now crossed the coveted USD 6 million mark in North America, establishing itself as the third highest-grossing Indian film in the territory.The film, which had already earned USD 5.1 million till 5th August, continued its strong box office momentum in the weeks that followed. On 18th August, Saiyaara officially breached the USD 6 million milestone. That means the film added nearly a million dollars in just 13 days, a feat that underlines its consistent theatrical pull despite intense competition.‘Saiyaara’ breaks lifetime records of ‘War’ and ‘Dunki’ by crossing ₹500 cr worldwide in 18 days.The Rankings GameAmong Indian films in North America, Saiyaara now stands at No. 3, behind two heavyweight performers. At the top is Chhaava the historical epic starring Vicky Kaushal, Rashmika Mandanna, and Akshaye Khanna—which continues to lead with USD 6.4 million. Rajinikanth’s action-packed entertainer Coolie holds the second spot with USD 6.22 million.For Hindi films specifically, Saiyaara’s performance is even more remarkable. It is now the second-highest-grossing Hindi film ever in North America, trailing only Chhaava. Beating the ClashWhat makes Saiyaara’s journey more impressive is how it navigated a tough release window as after a strong run of 4 weeks the film ran into two behemoths Rajinikanth’s Coolie and Hrithik Roshan-Jr NTR’s War 2. While Coolie went on to mint USD 6.22 million in 5 days , War 2 also breached the USD 3 million mark. Yet, just as in the domestic market where it added Rs 1.90 crore in 4 days ( 14th August to 17th August) , Saiyaara managed to carve its own space overseas, proving that strong content and emotional appeal can help films rise above competition.Industry insiders point out that Mohit Suri’s brand of emotionally charged romance combined with a fresh pairing of Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda, and a well-curated music album has catapulted the film into everyone’s heart. For Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda, Saiyaara’s success is more than just box office numbers; it is a dream launch that has given them instant recognition on the global stage. And for Mohit Suri, it is yet another validation of his storytelling formula that continues to resonate with audiences across continents."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

She feels that Los Angeles cannot offer her or her children the humanity she has found across the world. This move follows other celebrities relocating overseas, such as Jimmy Kimmel, Ellen DeGeneres, and Rosie O'Donnell.  Hollywood star Angelina Jolie is reportedly gearing up to leave the United States and relocate abroad once her youngest children turn 18.The actress, is said to be considering “several locations abroad” as she prepares to list her Los Angeles home on the market, states a report on People. Jolie purchased the historic Cecil B. DeMille estate in Los Feliz in 2017 for a reported $24.5 million. The 11,000-square-foot property features six bedrooms and 10 bathrooms.Plan To Leave LAPeople reports that Jolie “never wanted to live in L.A. full time” but was limited by a custody arrangement with her former husband, Brad Pitt. Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Jolie admitted that she was living in LA only "because I have to be here from a divorce."Reason Why Jolie Was Forced To Stay In LAJolie said she’s ready to live abroad full time as she seeks qualities that Los Angeles can’t offer her or her children. "That humanity that I found across the world is not what I grew up with here," she said at the time.Pitt and Jolie, who finalised their divorce settlement in December, share six children. Jolie reportedly intends to relocate once the youngest twins, Knox and Vivienne, turn 18 next year.Hollywood Stars Moving AbroadJolie’s potential move abroad comes amid a wave of US celebrities relocating overseas following US President Donald Trump’s return to office. Talk show host Jimmy Kimmel recently revealed he had obtained Italian citizenship, while Ellen DeGeneres and her wife, Portia de Rossi, moved to England’s Cotswolds in late 2024.

The film, directed by Vivek Agnihotri, explores the 1946 Great Calcutta killings and stars Anupam Kher and Mithun Chakraborty.  Actress Pallavi Joshi has criticised the West Bengal administration after the trailer launch of ‘The Bengal Files’ was allegedly stopped in Kolkata last week. Joshi, who stars in the movie, called the government’s actions “unconstitutional” and dubbed the halt an 'attack on democracy'.On August 16, 2025, the film's director, Vivek Agnihotri claimed that the trailer launch was stopped at a five-star hotel in Kolkata. NDTV later reported that Kolkata Police said the director had not sought administrative permission for a public trailer viewing. Videos of police entering the venue quickly went viral on social media.Anupam Kher Praises Pallavi Joshi; Actress Stuns In ‘Tanvi The Great’ First LookPallavi reactsAs reported by India Today, Pallavi spoke at the trailer launch in New Delhi on Monday and said, "Since the story is rooted in Bengal, we felt it would be most appropriate to launch the trailer in Bengal in August, but the government silenced us. We feel it is an act which is not only arbitrary but also unconstitutional."She added, "What happened that day was not merely an assault on the film, but an assault on democracy itself. The voices of people and the voice of Bharat were suppressed and censored. The absence of dignity and the absence of the value of human life are the themes of our film. The government proved our theme is correct."Trailer launch halted on “laughable grounds”Joshi also expressed frustration at the reason given for stopping the event, was on "very laughable grounds." She went on to add, "They said we didn't have municipal permission...The videos are about the chaos that followed. Many women journalists got hurt. I was also very uncomfortable. Thanks to Vivek, we managed to get out. We feel the police and the government are forgetting their basic duty, i.e, protecting its citizens, especially women, and their modesty. That should have been the sole priority of women."About ‘The Bengal Files’‘The Bengal Files’ is based on the 1946 Great Calcutta killings, a tragic historical episode during the final years of British colonial rule. The film stars Anupam Kher, Mithun Chakraborty, Saswata Chatterjee, and Pallavi Joshi.

Despite winning a National Award early on, he battled prejudice and professional setbacks. Zeenat Aman's support proved pivotal, leading to his rise as a superstar with films like 'Disco Dancer,' ultimately earning him the Dadasaheb Phalke Award.  Mithun Chakraborty, the star who danced his way into history with iconic hits like ‘Disco Dancer’, ‘Dance Dance’, ‘Pyar Jhukta Nahin’, ‘Kasam Paida Karne Wale Ki’ and ‘Commando’, has lived one of the most dramatic journeys in Bollywood. From being shamed for his skin colour and thrown out of films even after winning a National Award, to sleeping on footpaths during his struggling days, his rise was anything but easy.'Ek Ke Baad Ek BrahMos, Then A Pee Dam': Mithun Chakraborty Warns Pak, Takes Dig At Bilawal BhuttoMithun’s early daysMithun was born on 16 July 1950, as Gouranga Chakraborty. He studied at Kolkata’s Scottish Church College. Coming from a lower middle-class family, he faced financial struggles right from the start. Later, he cracked admission into the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), one of the country’s most prestigious film schools, where he trained to be a professional actor.Sleeping on footpaths to surviveHis road to films was far from easy. Before his debut, Mithun went through years of hardship in Mumbai. He often slept hungry and even spent nights on footpaths. Recalling those dark days on the reality show Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Li’l Champs, Mithun had said, “I have seen days when I had to sleep with an empty stomach, and I used to cry myself to sleep. In fact, there were days when I had to think about what my next meal will be, and where I will go to sleep. I have also slept on the footpath for a lot of days.”Why Mithun does not want a biopicDespite his success, Mithun never wants his life to be made into a film. He explained, “And that’s the only reason I don’t want my biopic to be ever made! My story will never inspire anyone, it will break them down (mentally) and discourage people from achieving their dreams. I don’t want that to happen! If I can do it, anyone else can do it. I have fought a lot to prove myself in this industry. I am not legendary because I have given hit movies, I am a legend because I have surpassed all the pains and struggles of my life.”Winning a National Award but losing workMithun made his big screen debut with Mrinal Sen’s ‘Mrigayaa’. The film not only marked his entry into Bollywood but also won him the National Award for Best Actor. While most actors wait years for such recognition, Mithun achieved it with his first film. But instead of helping his career, the award created unexpected problems.He recalled in an interview with India Today, “After Mrigayaa, I got my first National Award. As it happens, I started acting like Al Pacino. It felt like I was the greatest actor. My attitude changed, so the producer saw this and said, ‘get out.’ Then I realised my mistake.”Shamed for skin colour in BollywoodIf pride slowed him down, prejudice nearly broke him. Mithun was constantly reminded of his complexion. In an interview with Radio Nasha, he shared, “I was always called out for my skin colour. I have been disrespected for a lot of years because of my skin colour.”He used dance as a way to shift the focus, “I thought that if I danced with my legs, nobody would see my colour and that happened. My dance made people forget my colour. Nobody imagined a hero with my colour. I used to feel very bad and I used to cry.”Becoming the common man’s superstarFor millions of fans, Mithun became proof that even someone with nothing could make it big. He said,“Looking at me, people’s expectations increased and they thought that even my son can become an actor despite living in a chawl or village. I became a common man’s hero. It was a very big thing for me to become a superstar of a common man.”Zeenat Aman breaks the industry jinxJust when he was being pushed aside, help came from one of Bollywood’s leading ladies. Zeenat Aman, who was at the peak of her career, agreed to star opposite him in Brij Sadanah’s ‘Taqdeer’. It proved to be a turning point.As Mithun shared on Sa Re Ga Ma Pa, “It was Zeenat ji who broke the jinx. Zeenat ji had the status of the number 1 heroine of that time, so following her footsteps, every other actress started saying yes to the films that I worked in. With Taqdeer’s release, I became an A-category actor.”From ‘Surakshaa’ to ‘Disco Dancer’ fameThree years after ‘Mrigayaa’, Mithun hit another milestone with the 1979 spy thriller ‘Surakshaa’. This film laid the foundation for his superstardom in the ’80s. The success was followed by blockbusters like ‘Disco Dancer’, ‘Dance Dance’, ‘Pyar Jhukta Nahin’, ‘Kasam Paida Karne Wale Ki’, and many more’. His unique moves and on-screen charm made him the king of dance films and one of the biggest stars of that decade.Beyond commercial hits, Mithun proved himself as a serious actor too. As reported by IMDb, he went on to star in over 350 films across multiple languages. He went on to win two more National Awards for ‘Tahader Katha’ in 1992 and ‘Swami Vivekananda’ in 1998. Decades later, his contribution to Indian cinema was celebrated once again when he was honoured with the Dadasaheb Phalke Award at the 70th National Film Awards in 2024."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Amitabh Bachchan playfully teased Anushka about it during her appearance with Varun Dhawan to promote 'Sui Dhaaga.' The couple, married since 2017 and parents to Vamika and Akaay, were recently spotted enjoying family time in London.  Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli are one of the most loved celebrity couples in India. Though they kept their relationship quiet in the beginning, once they tied the knot, they never shied away from showing affection for each other in public. One of the most adorable moments between them happens on the cricket ground. Every time Virat scores a century, he blows a flying kiss towards Anushka in the stands.But did you know that this sweet tradition once became the subject of a light-hearted tease on television? It happened on none other than ‘Kaun Banega Crorepati’, where Amitabh Bachchan himself pulled Anushka’s leg in front of a live audience.When Anushka came to ‘KBC’A few years ago, Anushka had joined Big B’s popular quiz show ‘Kaun Banega Crorepati’ to promote her film ‘Sui Dhaaga’ along with Varun Dhawan. While there, she also sat beside a participant on the hot seat. That was when the fun began.The ‘Zanjeer’ actor casually asked the contestant if she watches cricket on television. She replied that she does not. Amitabh then pointed out with a smile that Anushka certainly does.Anushka explained why she watches cricketThe contestant looked a little puzzled by his remark. To clear the confusion, Anushka jumped in and said that her husband is a cricketer and that she watches cricket for him. That is when Amitabh decided to tease her. He asked cheekily, “Kewal unko dekhne ke kiye (Just for him)?” The ‘Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi’ actress quickly corrected herself, adding that she also watches to support the team.Amitabh mimicked Virat’s flying kissNot letting the fun stop there, the ‘Sholay’ actor went on to tease her further. He said everyone knows what happens on television and then, to the surprise of all, blew a kiss to the camera. The gesture was a clear imitation of Virat’s famous flying kiss celebration on the field.The moment had everyone in splits. Anushka burst out laughing, the audience clapped and laughed, and Varun Dhawan could not control himself either. He was seen rolling with laughter as Amitabh pulled off the playful act perfectly.Virat and Anushka’s wedding and childrenAnushka and Virat took their relationship to the next step when they tied the knot in a dreamy ceremony in December 2017. The much-talked-about wedding was followed by more happy news. The couple was blessed with their daughter Vamika in January 2021, and later, they welcomed their son Akaay in February 2024. Their life as parents has been filled with love and joy, and they have always tried to keep their children away from the media glare.Couple enjoys family time in LondonCurrently, Anushka and Virat are in London, where they are spending some private family time together. Videos recently surfaced on social media, showing the couple enjoying a sunny day out. Interestingly, they were spotted without their children Vamika and Akaay during this outing.

Matthew Perry death: 'Ketamine Queen' to plead guilty

Iwamasa repeatedly injected Perry with the ketamine that Sangha supplied, including on October 28, 2023, when he administered at least three shots of Sangha's ketamine, which killed the actor.  Jasveen Sangha, a dealer dubbed the "Ketamine Queen" has agreed to plead guilty to supplying the drugs that killed "Friends" actor Matthew Perry, the US Department of Justice said Monday.Sangha, 42, will admit several charges, including one of distribution of ketamine resulting in death or serious bodily injury in relation to the late star.A dual citizen of the United States and Britain, she is expected to formally enter her pleas in the coming weeks. She has been in federal custody since August 2024.Sangha will become the fifth person to admit playing a part in the death of the beloved actor, who had openly struggled for decades with substance addiction.Perry, 54, was found dead in the hot tub of his Los Angeles home in October 2023.A criminal investigation was launched soon after an autopsy discovered he had high levels of ketamine -- an anesthetic -- in his system.Last month, Dr Salvador Plasencia pleaded guilty to four counts of distribution of ketamine in the weeks before Perry's death.Another doctor, Mark Chavez, admitted last year to conspiring to distribute ketamine to Perry.Plasencia allegedly bought ketamine off Chavez and sold it to the American-Canadian actor at hugely inflated prices."I wonder how much this moron will pay," Plasencia wrote in one text message.According to her plea agreement, Sangha worked with a middleman, Erik Fleming, to sell 51 vials of ketamine to Perry's live-in personal assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa.Iwamasa repeatedly injected Perry with the ketamine that Sangha supplied, including on October 28, 2023, when he administered at least three shots of Sangha's ketamine, which killed the actor.The Justice Department said when Sangha heard news reports about Perry's sudden death, she tried to cover her tracks."Delete all our messages," she instructed Fleming.When investigators raided Sangha's home they found methamphetamine, ketamine, ecstasy, cocaine, and counterfeit Xanax pills, as well as a money counting machine, a scale, and devices to detect wireless signals and hidden cameras, according to the Justice Department.- 'Mostly sober' -Sangha is expected to plead guilty to one count of maintaining a drug-involved premises, three counts of distribution of ketamine, and one count of distribution of ketamine resulting in death or serious bodily injury."She's taking responsibility for her actions," her lawyer Mark Geragos told AFP.Sangha could face decades in prison when sentenced.The other people involved in the supply of drugs to Perry are expected to appear in court over the coming months to learn their fates.Perry had been taking ketamine as part of supervised therapy for depression.But prosecutors say that before his death he became addicted to the substance, which also has psychedelic properties and is a popular party drug."Friends," which followed the lives of six New Yorkers navigating adulthood, dating and careers, drew a massive following and made megastars of previously unknown actors.Perry's role as the sarcastic man-child Chandler brought him fabulous wealth, but hid a dark struggle with addiction to painkillers and alcohol.In 2018, he suffered a drug-related burst colon and underwent multiple surgeries.In his 2022 memoir "Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing," Perry described going through detox dozens of times."I have mostly been sober since 2001," he wrote, "save for about sixty or seventy little mishaps.""Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousPreity Mukhundhan radiates

A viral gym video showcases his dedication to fitness through disciplined workouts. Beyond physical exercise, he emphasizes yoga, meditation, and a clean vegetarian diet for overall well-being. His latest film, ‘Coolie,’ released on August 14th, has already grossed over Rs.  Rajinikanth, often called one of the greatest icons of Indian cinema, has ruled the silver screen for nearly fifty years. With a career packed with blockbuster hits and an unmatched fan base, his charm and energy continue to inspire people across the world. Even at seventy-four, the superstar of ‘Coolie’ and ‘Jailer’ shows no signs of slowing down. Instead, he is proving every day that age is no barrier to fitness, health and success.Viral gym videoRecently, a short clip of Rajinikanth exercising in a gym went viral on social media. Fans were thrilled to see the actor working out with the same discipline that made him a star. In the video, he begins with an incline dumbbell press, building strength in his upper body. He then moves to squats with the help of a bench, targeting his legs and core. To finish, he flexes his biceps while his trainer stands proudly beside him. The video was shared widely, with fans praising his determination and showing how fitness is a lifelong commitment.The power of Yoga, Meditation and KriyaWhile gym workouts are important, Rajinikanth also gives equal importance to inner strength. Yoga and breathing exercises have been part of his daily routine for years, reported The Health Site. In an interview cited by Telugu movie entertainment website Cinejosh, he has often credited more than 20 years of Kriya Yoga practice for giving him energy, focus and inner calm. This discipline, he believes, is the real reason behind his ability to remain positive and balanced even with the pressures of stardom.A simple and clean vegetarian dietRajinikanth made a big change in his lifestyle in 2014 when he adopted vegetarianism for health reasons. Since then, his meals are fresh, simple and home-cooked. As reported by Business Standard, he prefers fruits, vegetables, grains and nuts, while cutting out processed foods, sugar, fast food and refined dairy products. This clean diet not only keeps his body fit but also gives him the energy he needs to perform with such vigour on screen.Rest, recovery and time in natureAnother secret to his energy is proper rest and recovery. Sleep is non-negotiable for Rajinikanth. After completing each film, he takes time off to recharge and visits the Himalayas, where he finds both peace and strength in the lap of nature. These trips are not just about physical rest but also about spiritual healing, which helps him return to work with renewed energy.Discipline over quick fixesUnlike many who look for shortcuts, Rajinikanth’s fitness is built on years of discipline. He combines structured workouts, meditation, clean eating and rest in a way that balances both body and mind. His lifestyle shows that real strength comes from consistency, mindfulness and a deep spiritual connection. This is why he remains a wellness icon for fans across all age groups.‘Coolie’ roars at the Box OfficeEven as he maintains his health, Rajinikanth continues to deliver massive hits. His latest film ‘Coolie’, released on 14 August, turned theatres into a festival. The film created huge excitement from the start and lived up to expectations with a strong opening. Despite clashing with the big Bollywood spy thriller ‘War 2’, starring Hrithik Roshan, Jr NTR and Kiara Advani, ‘Coolie’ stormed ahead from day one. According to Sacnilk, the film collected over Rs. 206 crores in just five days, proving once again that Rajinikanth’s magic at the box office is as powerful as ever."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
