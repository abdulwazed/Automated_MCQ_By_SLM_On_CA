CSIS had posted on its official X handle “Back in June, CSIS launched its #PrideSeason celebrations with a few guest speakers. Thanks to the talented Two-spirit hoop dancer Makhena Ranken Guerin, the hilarious Canadian comedienne Ava Val, and inspirational public servant David Da Silva...”The post quickly sparked an outpouring of critical remarks online. Some commentators seized on the juxtaposition of a national security agency engaging in Pride celebrations, ridiculing the blend of intelligence work with performative inclusivity. Some social-media users mockingly reacted that CSIS had “gone full rainbow”. Others said such initiatives risked trivializing the gravity of national security concerns.Observers noted that the intelligence agency had been increasingly active on social media platforms, engaging publicly and actively sharing cultural moments.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
