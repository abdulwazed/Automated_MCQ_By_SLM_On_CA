Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla calls on PM Modi at his 7, Lok Kalyan Marg residence on Monday NEW DELHI: Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, the first Indian astronaut to go to the International Space Station (ISS), was embraced by PM Narendra Modi when the country’s spaceman called on him at his 7, Lok Kalyan Marg residence after his successful mission to space.Shukla aka Shux, who arrived in India on Sunday from the US, was patted on the back by the PM for successfully piloting the Axiom-4 mission. He shared pictures of the Earth clicked from ISS with the PM and also shared his experience about the mission and zero-gravity experiments he did in space with Modi.After his one-to-one meet, Modi posted on X, “Had a great interaction with Shubhanshu Shukla. We discussed a wide range of subjects including his experiences in space, progress in science & technology as well as India's ambitious Gaganyaan mission. India is proud of his feat.”A day before, Shukla, who returned from the US after an 18-day space mission on ISS, was given a warm welcome at the IGI airport by space minister Jitendra Singh, Delhi CM Rekha Gupta and a large crowd waving the national flag.Earlier in the day, Parliament honoured the IAF pilot-turned Indian astronaut. The discussion was filled with praise and a strong sense of national pride, even as opposition parties staged a boycott. “Shubhanshu Shukla’s space travel and safe return is not just a successful mission, but a moment of pride for the entire nation and inspiration for the youth,” LS Speaker Om Birla said. Parliament described Shukla’s achievement as a new chapter in India’s space exploration, noting that it not only advanced homegrown science but also inspired a generation of young Indians to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and space.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous'Coolie' actress Rachita Ram's most gorgeous picturesEntertainmentPreity Mukhundhan radiates eleganceEntertainmentNeha Harsora’s dazzling and dreamy ethnic lookstvBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning weekend looks of the contestantstvFun facts about the Param Sundari actor Sidharth MalhotraEntertainment8 simple habits that will help reduce stress on the eyes and improve vision naturallyLifestyle8 times Samantha Ruth Prabhu turned perfect muse for Krésha BajajLifestyleSaree tales by actress Nisha RavikrishnantvManasi Parekh Serves Style & SmilesEntertainment10 celebrity-inspired Indian baby boy namesLifestyle Next123 Photostories  10 lesser known health benefits of eating cardamomWhy Ganga aarti is performed every evening: Understanding its spiritual significanceHow to make Chia Seed and Coconut Oil hair mask for quick hair growthBrown bread vs multigrain bread vs white bread, which is worse?Power passports: Citizens of these 5 countries can enter 185+ nations visa-free or on arrivalHow to build a timeless wardrobe inspired by Meryl StreepMovies that capture the strength of smiling through painHigh uric acid levels linked to high BP, diabetes and heart disease: Early symptoms to watch forWorld Photography Day 2025: Explore India’s most photogenic Blue Flag beachesIncredible India: Know all about the pride and joy of Puneri Pagadis123Hot PicksCP RadhakrishnanMumbai RainsHurricane Erin 2025Brooklyn Nightclub ShootingMarco RubioCrimeaBank Holidays AugustTop TrendingPatrick MahomesAntonio BrownRaheem MorrisJoy TaylorTravis Hunters WifeOlivia Paige DunneMartina NavratilovaMarco BelinelliPatrick MahomesTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteHow 'India’s secrets' helped Shubhanshu Shukla in space: Astronaut shares experience with PM Modi - WatchWhy should one pay to spend 12 hours in traffic jams?
