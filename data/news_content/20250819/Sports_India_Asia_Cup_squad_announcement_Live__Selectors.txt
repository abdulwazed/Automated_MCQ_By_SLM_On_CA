Gill, who has enjoyed a stellar run as Test captain in England, has struggled to slot seamlessly into the current T20 combination. For chief selector Ajit Agarkar and his panel, the question is whether it makes sense to disturb a side that has been functioning smoothly.   The talent pool available only complicates matters. Indian cricket currently has an abundance of options, with multiple players ready to step in for every position. At the top of the batting order alone, six names are in contention.   While Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson, and Tilak Varma impressed last season, Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and IPL’s Orange Cap winner Sai Sudharsan are equally compelling picks.   In spin, the competition is just as tight. Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, and Ravi Bishnoi are all pressing for selection, while veteran Yuzvendra Chahal remains on the fringes.   Inside the team management, there are two schools of thought. Some feel it would be unjust to drop consistent performers in order to bring back a bigger star. Others argue that Gill represents the future of Indian cricket—an all-format captain in the making and a strong commercial face for the game.   But his return won’t be straightforward. Under Suryakumar Yadav’s captaincy, India has won 17 of its last 20 T20Is, a remarkable record achieved without Gill or Jaiswal. Yet, before focusing on Tests, both had been doing well in T20Is and the IPL.   Gill also briefly served as Surya’s deputy before his Test duties took over, with Axar Patel stepping in as vice-captain. Reinstating Gill could leave Axar feeling sidelined, despite his reliable performances.   If Gill is named in the 15, selectors may need to reshuffle the playing XI, forcing one of Abhishek, Sanju, or Tilak out. Rinku Singh could also miss out, particularly since head coach Gautam Gambhir doesn’t believe in a fixed “finisher’s” role, reducing the left-hander’s importance.   Fast Bowling Choices  Hardik Pandya, Jasprit Bumrah, and Arshdeep Singh are certainties, leaving one reserve seamer’s slot up for grabs. Harshit Rana appears to be the front-runner, with Prasidh Krishna and Mohammed Siraj largely seen as red-ball bowlers. With a home series against the West Indies in October, Bumrah may even be rested, giving others a chance.   Spin Department  Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, and Varun Chakravarthy are the leading names, with Washington Sundar likely to make the cut as well, thanks to his all-round abilities. Although conditions in Dubai and Abu Dhabi may not be overly slow, spinners are still expected to have a say.   All-rounders and Keepers  With Nitish Kumar Reddy and Rishabh Pant unavailable due to injuries, Shivam Dube is set to back up Hardik as a seam-bowling all-rounder. For the second wicketkeeper’s role, the contest is between Dhruv Jurel and Jitesh Sharma. Jitesh, who played a key role as a lower-order hitter in Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s IPL triumph, has the edge for the finisher’s slot. 12:54 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: ScheduleIndia will kick off their campaign against the UAE on September 10, while the high-voltage game against Pakistan is scheduled for the 14th, with both fixtures set to be played in Dubai. India will play their final group stage fixture against Oman on September 19 in Abu Dhabi.After the group stage, the tournament will proceed to the Super 4, where the top two teams from each group will qualify. If India finishes at the top of Group A, then all of their Super 4 matches will be held in Dubai. If India finishes second, then one of their Super 4 clashes will be held in Abu Dhabi and the remaining two in Dubai. The Super 4 stage will run from September 20 to 26. Dubai will host the final, which is scheduled for September 28.12:50 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Key talking pointsWith Suryakumar, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel being batting order certainties, it would be interesting to see if Shreyas gets a look in. What really strengthens Shreyas’ case is his spin-hitting prowess, much-improved skills to handle short balls and showing assurance as a reliable middle-order batter for Punjab Kings in IPL 2025.On the other hand, Jitesh’s name is a hot favourite for the reserve keeper-batter slot, who can also play finisher’s role when needed with his power-hitting skills and repertoire of ramps and scoops. Jitesh had a stellar IPL 2025 season with the bat and gloves to help Royal Challengers Bengaluru win its maiden IPL title.Amidst all this, Rinku, who was a part of India’s last T20I assignment against England in January, may just miss out. Rinku has been a designated finisher for both India and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). But a patchy IPL season and what if India seeks an all-rounder to excel in slow conditions in Dubai and Abu Dhabi may conjure up to weaken Rinku’s case.With Nitish Kumar Reddy still undergoing rehab for knee ligament injury, Riyan, Sundar and Shivam Dube shape up as contenders for an all-rounders’ slot. Sundar’s off-spin along with his batting makes him a tempting prospect while Dube is a like-to-like replacement for Nitish in terms of skillsets.Riyan, whose batting and handy spin bowling got him on T20I tours of Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka in 2024, provides the balance, but has not done anything worthwhile yet. With Axar, Kuldeep Yadav, and Varun Chakaravarthy set to helm spin department, it would be interesting to see who between Sundar and Riyan gets selectors’ backing.In fast bowling department, with Hardik, Jasprit Bumrah (provided he’s picked) and Arshdeep Singh around, decision needs to be made on including either of Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna and Harshit Rana. In the end, the Asia Cup squad will be the first glimpse of India’s plans for the World Cup, and debate over inclusions and omissions is certain to continue until the main tournament gets underway.12:38 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Pakistan squadSalman Ali Agha (c), Abrar Ahmed, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Hasan Nawaz, Hussain Talat, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Haris (wk), Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Waseem Jnr, Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, Salman Mirza, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Sufyan Moqim.12:24 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Captain checked inTeam India captain Suryakumar Yadav has arrived at the BCCI HQ ahead of the team selection.11:58 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Gill & JaiswalWhile Abhishek’s spot looks untouchable, the debate intensifies over the third opener. Both Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal last played a T20I in July 2024 and haven’t featured in the format since. Their Test form is strong, but in T20Is, they trail far behind Abhishek’s dominance.11:41 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Update&mdash; AraniBasuTOI (@AraniBasuTOI) 11:39 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: The Samson connectionSince October 2024, Abhishek and Sanju Samson have opened together in 12 consecutive matches, consistently giving India fiery starts. Their chemistry at the top has become one of India’s biggest assets heading into the Asia Cup.11:31 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Numbers don’t lieIn 16 T20I innings, Abhishek has blasted 535 runs at a staggering strike rate of 193.85 — the highest by any Indian with over 500 runs in the format. His record includes two centuries and two fifties, cementing his reputation as a powerplay destroyer.11:20 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Abhishek Sharma – Case Closed?Among the many selection debates, one name stands above the rest — Abhishek Sharma. With back-to-back explosive IPL seasons and a No.1 ICC T20I batting ranking, the 24-year-old opener has transformed from an IPL sensation into India’s most indispensable T20 batter.11:04 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Massive updateKindly note that the first press conference is expected to be delayed owing to weather disruptions.10:55 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Coach Predicts Dangerous DuoKuldeep’s coach Kapil Pandey believes the Kuldeep–Varun spin combo could be India’s trump card. “If they bowl together, opposition will have no time to think.

The left-arm wrist-spinner last played at the 2024 T20 World Cup, taking 10 wickets in five games. With 69 scalps in 40 T20Is, Kuldeep remains a lethal option in UAE’s spin-friendly conditions.09:46 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Spin & finisher debateThe spin attack looks strong with Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, and Varun Chakravarthy in pole position, while Washington Sundar could be backed by Gambhir for his all-round skills. In the lower order, Jitesh Sharma’s IPL-winning cameo-filled season gives him an edge over Dhruv Jurel for the second wicketkeeper slot.09:19 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Bowling department clearerUnlike batting, the bowling choices seem straightforward. Hardik Pandya, Jasprit Bumrah, and Arshdeep Singh are automatic picks, while Harshit Rana is the frontrunner for the reserve seamer slot. With Bumrah likely to be rested for the West Indies series in October, Siraj and Prasidh Krishna stand ready as backups.09:10 (IST) Aug 19Women's World Cup India Team Squad Live: Kranti Goud in the SpotlightAmong established names like Harmanpreet, Smriti, Jemimah, and Deepti, Mithali singled out 22-year-old pacer Kranti Goud as a potential X-factor. With only four ODIs under her belt, Goud impressed with a six-wicket haul in England, and Raj believes her raw pace and grit could be pivotal in India’s World Cup campaign.09:07 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Vice-captaincy conundrumIf Gill is recalled, what happens to leadership hierarchy? Gill earlier served as Suryakumar’s deputy before Test duties. Axar Patel, now vice-captain, has been steady in the role. A reshuffle could create dressing-room unease, adding another layer to the Gill inclusion debate.08:59 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Top-Order congestionIndia’s biggest puzzle lies in the top three. Six names are in contention: Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson, Tilak Varma, Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and Sai Sudharsan. With all in good form, selectors must decide whether to reward consistency or make room for Gill’s star power. One change could unsettle the settled XI.08:52 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Selection Day DilemmaThe Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee meets today with one burning question: how to fit Shubman Gill into India’s in-form T20I setup. Under Suryakumar Yadav’s captaincy, India boast an 85% win record (17 wins in 20 matches), making the task of tweaking the batting order both risky and controversial.08:47 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Women's World Cup squad to be announced todayIndia’s recent run of victories has bolstered confidence but the women’s selection panel, headed by Neetu David, will face some tricky questions on the inclusion of Shafali Verma and pacer Renuka Thakur when it meets here on Tuesday to pick the squad for the ODI World Cup.Apart from Pakistan playing all their matches in Colombo, India will host the 50-over World Cup comprising eight teams from September 30 with their eyes firmly set on an elusive global trophy.

The tournament will follow the T20I format and feature eight teams competing across both venues, with Dubai hosting 11 matches and Abu Dhabi hosting eight fixtures."The players who will be selected will be the best for the country, and I am very proud of the way we are playing cricket, the way we played against England. We will win the Asia Cup," Sharma told reporters.The Asian Cricket Council has confirmed the participation of five full member nations - Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka - along with the UAE, Oman, and Hong Kong. The teams have been divided into two groups, with India, Pakistan, UAE, and Oman in Group A, while Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Hong Kong form Group B.08:06 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Top 2 T20I run-scorers for both India and Pakistan won't be part of Asia Cup 2025 - here is whyThe 2025 T20 Asia Cup is set to have a very different look, with the leading run-getters of both India and Pakistan missing from the tournament.For India, stalwarts Rohit Sharma (4,231 runs) and Virat Kohli (4,188 runs) have already bid farewell to T20 internationals. On the other hand, Pakistan’s selectors have taken a bold step by leaving out Babar Azam (4,223 runs) and Mohammad Rizwan (3,414 runs) from the 17-member squad announced on Sunday.Pakistan, under new captain Salman Ali Agha, will warm up for the Asia Cup with a tri-series against Afghanistan and the UAE in Sharjah from August 29 to September 7. The continental showpiece kicks off in the Emirates on September 9.The exclusion of Babar and Rizwan has triggered intense debate across cricketing circles, especially considering the pair played pivotal roles in Pakistan’s iconic 10-wicket victory over India at the 2021 T20 World Cup.READ FULL STORY07:36 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: 'Don’t make Vaibhav Suryavanshi wait'Former India skipper Kris Srikkanth has backed 14-year-old sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi for a place in India’s 15-member squad for the Asia Cup T20, which begins on September 9. His endorsement comes just days before the selectors meet on August 19 to finalise the squad, with stiff competition for spots—particularly at the top of the order.Vaibhav has rapidly risen as a serious contender after a breakout season in IPL 2025, where he amassed 252 runs in just seven matches for the Rajasthan Royals at a strike rate of over 200. His whirlwind 35-ball century against Gujarat Titans was the second-fastest ton in IPL history, further cementing his reputation as one of the brightest young batting talents.The teenager carried that momentum into the U19 tour of England, where he struck a century and impressed across both one-day and four-day formats, showcasing his adaptability and temperament at the highest junior level."You have to play bold. Don't make him wait. Don't say things like 'let him mature'. He is already playing with remarkable maturity. His shot-making has been on another level. If I were chairman, I would definitely have him in the squad," Srikkanth stated on his YouTube show.READ FULL STORY07:06 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: All you need to know!When and where will 15-member side be announced? DateTimingVenue confirmedThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will unveil its 15-member squad for the ACC Men’s Asia Cup 2025 on Tuesday, following a high-profile selection meeting in Mumbai. The Senior Men’s Selection Committee will gather at the BCCI headquarters, with the squad announcement scheduled for 1:30 PM (IST) on the 4th floor of the BCCI HQ.The press conference will be attended by India’s T20 captain and the chairman of selectors.The Asia Cup, to be played in the T20 format in the UAE from September 9 to 28, comes just a year after India lifted the 2024 T20 World Cup.Naturally, the spotlight is on continuity and trust in the young T20 specialists who powered India’s success.Suryakumar Yadav is expected to continue as captain, having cleared his fitness test at the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence.According to a report from TOI, star opener Shubman Gill, despite stellar Test and IPL performances, may find it difficult to break into the T20 side.With Sanju Samson, Abhishek Sharma, and Tilak Varma delivering consistently in the shortest format, the management is keen to back them. TOI understands that Gill remains in the selectors’ long-term plans, but not as a frontline T20 option.On the bowling front, Jasprit Bumrah is set to return after overcoming a minor knee concern, while Mohammed Siraj could be rested following a heavy workload in England.Arshdeep Singh, Hardik Pandya, and Prasidh Krishna are likely seam-bowling options, with spinners Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, and Washington Sundar in contention for the UAE’s slow pitches.India are grouped with Pakistan, UAE, and Oman in the Asia Cup.

Both would be keen to get their hands on leather and rattle the opposition.The two spinners come into the tournament with different recent history.Kuldeep spent the entire tour of England on the bench. Carrying drinks, passing on messages from the coaching staff, and quietly watching his teammates from the dressing room was all the chinaman managed over five Tests.Now, with the Asia Cup squad to be revealed on Tuesday (August 19), Kuldeep will be hoping to don the India blues, even if he didn't get the chance to wear the whites.The 30-year-old last featured in a T20I in the 2024 T20 World Cup, where he picked up 10 wickets in five matches. Overall, Kuldeep has played 40 T20Is, claiming 69 wickets, including two five-wicket hauls.Known for his deceptive wrong ’uns and sharp flippers, he remains a potent threat to batters, especially in UAE's spin-friendly conditions.While Kuldeep hasn’t played a T20I in the UAE, he has featured in ODIs there. He was also part of India’s victorious squads in the 2018 and 2023 editions of the Asia Cup (both in the ODI format).Varun Chakravarthy, meanwhile, has been in excellent form since making his international return last year.The 33-year-old mystery spinner, armed with nine different variations, has already produced match-winning spells, including two five-wicket hauls in T20Is and another in ODIs during India’s ICC Champions Trophy triumph.In his short T20I career so far, he has bagged 33 wickets in 18 matches.READ FULL STORY06:26 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: All-rounders and KeepersWith Nitish Kumar Reddy and Rishabh Pant still recovering from injuries, Shivam Dube is set to be the second seam-bowling all-rounder behind Pandya.

Conditions in Dubai and Abu Dhabi may not be as slow as in the Champions Trophy, but spin will still play a significant role.06:25 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Pacers’ PuzzleHardik Pandya doubles up as a frontline seamer alongside Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh, leaving one spot for a reserve quick. Harshit Rana is currently the frontrunner, with Prasidh Krishna and Mohammed Siraj seen more as red-ball specialists. With a home series against West Indies looming in October, Bumrah could even be rested, allowing Prasidh and Siraj opportunities.06:24 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: 'Sweet' headache for selectorsAs India’s selectors sit down on Tuesday to finalise the 15-member squad for the Asia Cup in the UAE, their biggest challenge could be fitting Shubman Gill into an already stable T20 set-up.Gill, who has enjoyed a stellar run as Test captain in England, has struggled to slot seamlessly into the current T20 combination.
