Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem said the death of three people in Florida caused by a semi truck's wrong U-turn was a gut-wrenching tragedy which should have never happened. Noem said DHS will work with the US Department of Transportation to ensure that illegal aliens do not get licenses from sanctuary jurisdictions. "3 innocent people were killed in Florida because Gavin Newsom’s California DMV issued an illegal alien a Commercial Driver’s License. This gut wrenching tragedy should have never happened," Noem posted."Three innocent people were killed in Florida because Gavin Newsom’s California DMV issued an illegal alien a Commercial Driver’s License—this state of governance is asinine," DHS said in a statement."How many more innocent people have to die before Gavin Newsom stops playing games with the safety of the American public? We pray for the victims and their families. Secretary Noem and DHS are working around the clock to protect the public and get these criminal illegal aliens out of America," the statement added.Florida accident: Why DHS fighting with California Harjinder Singh, the driver of the semi that took a wrong U-turn and caused the deaths of three people who were in their vehicle, got his driving license in California. As California is Democratic ruled, the Trump administration and Governor Gavin Newsom's office started passing the buck on one another for the tragedy. While DHS blamed California for giving a driver's license to the illegal alien, Newsom's office said Singh entered the US in 2018 when Trump was the president. Did Harjinder Singh enter US illegally in 2018?DHS confirmed that Harjinder Singh entered the US illegally through the southern border in 2018 and was arrested within two days. But he said he was scared to go back to India -- a fear that was affirmed by US Citizenship and Immigration Services. At that time, he was released on a $5,000 immigration bond. His immigration proceedings remained pending since then but he managed to get a driver's license in California. California's Assembly Bill 60 (AB 60), enacted in 2015, allows undocumented immigrants to apply for a driver's license if they can provide proof of identity and California residency. These licenses are marked "not for federal identification."About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
