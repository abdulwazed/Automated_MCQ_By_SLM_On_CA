Jabbar has directed senior faculty and department heads not to issue public statements without approval, warning of disciplinary action for media or social media criticism. The move follows remarks by doctors Mohandas and Harris Chirakkal on stalled cadaver organ transplantation and policy lapses, sparking debate over transparency and academic freedom.  Thiruvananthapuram, India: The Principal of Thiruvananthapuram Medical College, Dr. P.K. Jabbar, has issued a directive prohibiting department heads and senior faculty from making public statements without prior approval.The decision was formally conveyed during a meeting of department heads, following controversies triggered by remarks from two senior doctors, Dr. Mohandas and Dr. Harris Chirakkal.According to the directive, any grievances, concerns, or criticisms must be routed through official channels and communicated to higher authorities within the medical education department. Direct remarks in the media, on social media, or in public forums could invite disciplinary action.The move comes after strong criticism by former Head of Nephrology, Dr. Mohandas, who alleged that there had been “absolutely no progress” in cadaver organ transplantation since 2017. His remarks, accompanied by a social media post with photos of deceased former department heads, drew wide attention before being deleted. A memo was later served on him.Similarly, Dr. Harris Chirakkal stated that despite repeatedly flagging concerns through official channels, inaction by authorities compelled him to go public, further fuelling debate over transparency in the medical education sector.Against this backdrop, the Principal warned all department heads not to repeat such actions, stressing that while internal complaints and suggestions are welcome, public criticism of government policies or institutional matters will not be tolerated.The directive, aimed at maintaining discipline in the institution, has also sparked discussions within the medical fraternity on whether restricting public expression could suppress genuine concerns about healthcare policy and patient welfare.
