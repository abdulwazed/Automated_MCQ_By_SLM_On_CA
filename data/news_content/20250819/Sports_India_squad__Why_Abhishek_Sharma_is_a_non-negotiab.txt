His explosive IPL seasons and international success, including topping the ICC T20I batting rankings, make him indispensable. Sharma's formidable opening partnership with Sanju Samson and consistent performances solidify his place as India's T20I spearhead. Abhishek Sharma has staked his claim at the top of the order in India's T20 team.  The Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee will convene at the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai on Tuesday to pick India’s squad for the 2025 Asia Cup. The tournament, scheduled in the UAE from September 9–28, will be played in the T20I format, making it an important stepping stone towards the T20 World Cup next year.LIVE: Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIndia, placed in Group A alongside Pakistan, UAE, and Oman, will be watched closely as the selectors look to strike the balance between experience and youth. One name, however, should not even be up for debate — Abhishek Sharma.EXCLUSIVE: India to boycott Pakistan in Asia Cup? Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'From IPL sensation to India’s T20I spearheadAbhishek Sharma’s case for selection writes itself. His rise has been meteoric since his breakthrough IPL 2024 season for Sunrisers Hyderabad, where he hammered 484 runs at a staggering strike rate of 204.21.And if anyone thought 2024 was a one-off, Abhishek proved them wrong with another breathtaking IPL in 2025: 439 runs, which included a highest score of 141, at another stunning strike rate of 193.39. PollDo you believe the selectors should prioritize experience over youth in the squad selection?Yes, experience is crucialNo, youth brings energyThat form translated to the international stage almost instantly. After an anticlimactic four-ball duck on debut against Zimbabwe in July 2024, he responded with a jaw-dropping 100 off 47 balls in the very next match. Since then, the 24-year-old left-hander has not looked back, cementing his place at the top of India’s T20I order.Fast forward a year, and Abhishek sits at the very top of the ICC T20I batting rankings, making him the youngest Indian ever to achieve the No. 1 status in the format. He currently leads the chart ahead of compatriots Tilak Varma (No.2) and Suryakumar Yadav (No.6). That alone is a telling indicator of his indispensability.The numbers don’t lieIndia batter Abhishek Sharma. In 16 T20I innings for India, Abhishek has amassed 535 runs at a blistering strike rate of 193.85 — the highest for any Indian with over 500 runs in the format. His record already features two centuries and two fifties, underlining his ability to provide explosive starts and play match-winning knocks.His most recent masterpiece came against England at the Wankhede Stadium, where he smashed a record-breaking 135 off 54 balls — the highest individual T20I score by an Indian. That innings included 13 sixes and showcased his unmatched ability to dismantle world-class bowling.Crucially, Abhishek has formed a formidable opening partnership with Sanju Samson. Since being paired together against Bangladesh in October 2024, the duo have opened in 12 consecutive matches, giving India explosive starts almost every time.Abhishek Sharma in last 12 T20Is: 411 runs @34.25, SR 200.49 (2 fifties, 1 hundred)Sanju Samson in last 12 T20Is: 417 runs @37.91, SR 183.70 (3 hundreds)India’s record with Abhishek-Samson opening: 10 wins in 12 matchesThese numbers reflect not just individual brilliance but also a stable, high-impact opening formula that has worked wonders for India. The competition: Shubman Gill and Yashasvi JaiswalAbhishek Sharma, Shubman Gill and Yashasvi JaiswalThe selection dilemma lies in who joins Abhishek and Samson as the third opener. Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill, both coming off a prolific Test series in England, will stake their claims. But their T20I credentials have faded in comparison.Jaiswal’s last T20I: July 2024 vs Sri Lanka (10 off 9).Gill’s last T20I: Same match, scoring 39 off 37.Neither has played a T20I in more than a year, while Abhishek has established himself as India’s most consistent powerplay batter. Given the contrasting trajectories, the selectors may consider carrying either Gill or Jaiswal as backup, but dislodging Abhishek is not an option.Why Abhishek Sharma is non-negotiableWorld No.1 T20I batter – His ranking is a reflection of dominance across opponents and conditions.Explosive strike rate – At nearly 194 in internationals and 193.39 in IPL 2025, his scoring rate dwarfs not just Indian contemporaries but also most global stars.Big-match temperament – Two T20I hundreds already, including a record knock against England, underline his ability to step up.Proven opening partnership – The Abhishek-Samson duo has become India’s most reliable T20I opening combo in recent years.Consistency – Back-to-back stellar IPL seasons, apart from international success, have made him the most bankable young T20 batter in India.As India gear up for the Asia Cup, much chatter will swirl around Shubman Gill’s return, Yashasvi Jaiswal’s case, or middle-order reshuffles. But in the opening slot, there is no ambiguity. Abhishek Sharma has evolved from a promising IPL star into India’s T20I batting spearhead, with numbers, form, and rankings all backing his claim.The selectors may face tough calls in other departments, but when it comes to Abhishek, the decision is straightforward. He is not just a part of India’s Asia Cup squad — he is the foundation on which their T20 future must be built.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
