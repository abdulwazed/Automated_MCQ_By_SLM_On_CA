Gill, who has enjoyed a stellar run as Test captain in England, has struggled to slot seamlessly into the current T20 combination. For chief selector Ajit Agarkar and his panel, the question is whether it makes sense to disturb a side that has been functioning smoothly.   The talent pool available only complicates matters. Indian cricket currently has an abundance of options, with multiple players ready to step in for every position. At the top of the batting order alone, six names are in contention.   While Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson, and Tilak Varma impressed last season, Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and IPL’s Orange Cap winner Sai Sudharsan are equally compelling picks.   In spin, the competition is just as tight. Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, and Ravi Bishnoi are all pressing for selection, while veteran Yuzvendra Chahal remains on the fringes.   Inside the team management, there are two schools of thought. Some feel it would be unjust to drop consistent performers in order to bring back a bigger star. Others argue that Gill represents the future of Indian cricket—an all-format captain in the making and a strong commercial face for the game.   But his return won’t be straightforward. Under Suryakumar Yadav’s captaincy, India has won 17 of its last 20 T20Is, a remarkable record achieved without Gill or Jaiswal. Yet, before focusing on Tests, both had been doing well in T20Is and the IPL.   Gill also briefly served as Surya’s deputy before his Test duties took over, with Axar Patel stepping in as vice-captain. Reinstating Gill could leave Axar feeling sidelined, despite his reliable performances.   If Gill is named in the 15, selectors may need to reshuffle the playing XI, forcing one of Abhishek, Sanju, or Tilak out. Rinku Singh could also miss out, particularly since head coach Gautam Gambhir doesn’t believe in a fixed “finisher’s” role, reducing the left-hander’s importance.   Fast Bowling Choices  Hardik Pandya, Jasprit Bumrah, and Arshdeep Singh are certainties, leaving one reserve seamer’s slot up for grabs. Harshit Rana appears to be the front-runner, with Prasidh Krishna and Mohammed Siraj largely seen as red-ball bowlers. With a home series against the West Indies in October, Bumrah may even be rested, giving others a chance.   Spin Department  Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, and Varun Chakravarthy are the leading names, with Washington Sundar likely to make the cut as well, thanks to his all-round abilities. Although conditions in Dubai and Abu Dhabi may not be overly slow, spinners are still expected to have a say.   All-rounders and Keepers  With Nitish Kumar Reddy and Rishabh Pant unavailable due to injuries, Shivam Dube is set to back up Hardik as a seam-bowling all-rounder. For the second wicketkeeper’s role, the contest is between Dhruv Jurel and Jitesh Sharma. Jitesh, who played a key role as a lower-order hitter in Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s IPL triumph, has the edge for the finisher’s slot. 12:54 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: ScheduleIndia will kick off their campaign against the UAE on September 10, while the high-voltage game against Pakistan is scheduled for the 14th, with both fixtures set to be played in Dubai. India will play their final group stage fixture against Oman on September 19 in Abu Dhabi.After the group stage, the tournament will proceed to the Super 4, where the top two teams from each group will qualify. If India finishes at the top of Group A, then all of their Super 4 matches will be held in Dubai. If India finishes second, then one of their Super 4 clashes will be held in Abu Dhabi and the remaining two in Dubai. The Super 4 stage will run from September 20 to 26. Dubai will host the final, which is scheduled for September 28.12:50 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Key talking pointsWith Suryakumar, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel being batting order certainties, it would be interesting to see if Shreyas gets a look in. What really strengthens Shreyas’ case is his spin-hitting prowess, much-improved skills to handle short balls and showing assurance as a reliable middle-order batter for Punjab Kings in IPL 2025.On the other hand, Jitesh’s name is a hot favourite for the reserve keeper-batter slot, who can also play finisher’s role when needed with his power-hitting skills and repertoire of ramps and scoops. Jitesh had a stellar IPL 2025 season with the bat and gloves to help Royal Challengers Bengaluru win its maiden IPL title.Amidst all this, Rinku, who was a part of India’s last T20I assignment against England in January, may just miss out. Rinku has been a designated finisher for both India and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). But a patchy IPL season and what if India seeks an all-rounder to excel in slow conditions in Dubai and Abu Dhabi may conjure up to weaken Rinku’s case.With Nitish Kumar Reddy still undergoing rehab for knee ligament injury, Riyan, Sundar and Shivam Dube shape up as contenders for an all-rounders’ slot. Sundar’s off-spin along with his batting makes him a tempting prospect while Dube is a like-to-like replacement for Nitish in terms of skillsets.Riyan, whose batting and handy spin bowling got him on T20I tours of Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka in 2024, provides the balance, but has not done anything worthwhile yet. With Axar, Kuldeep Yadav, and Varun Chakaravarthy set to helm spin department, it would be interesting to see who between Sundar and Riyan gets selectors’ backing.In fast bowling department, with Hardik, Jasprit Bumrah (provided he’s picked) and Arshdeep Singh around, decision needs to be made on including either of Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna and Harshit Rana. In the end, the Asia Cup squad will be the first glimpse of India’s plans for the World Cup, and debate over inclusions and omissions is certain to continue until the main tournament gets underway.12:38 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Pakistan squadSalman Ali Agha (c), Abrar Ahmed, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Hasan Nawaz, Hussain Talat, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Haris (wk), Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Waseem Jnr, Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, Salman Mirza, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Sufyan Moqim.12:24 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Captain checked inTeam India captain Suryakumar Yadav has arrived at the BCCI HQ ahead of the team selection.11:58 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Gill & JaiswalWhile Abhishek’s spot looks untouchable, the debate intensifies over the third opener. Both Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal last played a T20I in July 2024 and haven’t featured in the format since. Their Test form is strong, but in T20Is, they trail far behind Abhishek’s dominance.11:41 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Update&mdash; AraniBasuTOI (@AraniBasuTOI) 11:39 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: The Samson connectionSince October 2024, Abhishek and Sanju Samson have opened together in 12 consecutive matches, consistently giving India fiery starts. Their chemistry at the top has become one of India’s biggest assets heading into the Asia Cup.11:31 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Numbers don’t lieIn 16 T20I innings, Abhishek has blasted 535 runs at a staggering strike rate of 193.85 — the highest by any Indian with over 500 runs in the format. His record includes two centuries and two fifties, cementing his reputation as a powerplay destroyer.11:20 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Abhishek Sharma – Case Closed?Among the many selection debates, one name stands above the rest — Abhishek Sharma. With back-to-back explosive IPL seasons and a No.1 ICC T20I batting ranking, the 24-year-old opener has transformed from an IPL sensation into India’s most indispensable T20 batter.11:04 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Massive updateKindly note that the first press conference is expected to be delayed owing to weather disruptions.10:55 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Coach Predicts Dangerous DuoKuldeep’s coach Kapil Pandey believes the Kuldeep–Varun spin combo could be India’s trump card. “If they bowl together, opposition will have no time to think.

The left-arm wrist-spinner last played at the 2024 T20 World Cup, taking 10 wickets in five games. With 69 scalps in 40 T20Is, Kuldeep remains a lethal option in UAE’s spin-friendly conditions.09:46 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Spin & finisher debateThe spin attack looks strong with Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, and Varun Chakravarthy in pole position, while Washington Sundar could be backed by Gambhir for his all-round skills. In the lower order, Jitesh Sharma’s IPL-winning cameo-filled season gives him an edge over Dhruv Jurel for the second wicketkeeper slot.09:19 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Bowling department clearerUnlike batting, the bowling choices seem straightforward. Hardik Pandya, Jasprit Bumrah, and Arshdeep Singh are automatic picks, while Harshit Rana is the frontrunner for the reserve seamer slot. With Bumrah likely to be rested for the West Indies series in October, Siraj and Prasidh Krishna stand ready as backups.09:10 (IST) Aug 19Women's World Cup India Team Squad Live: Kranti Goud in the SpotlightAmong established names like Harmanpreet, Smriti, Jemimah, and Deepti, Mithali singled out 22-year-old pacer Kranti Goud as a potential X-factor. With only four ODIs under her belt, Goud impressed with a six-wicket haul in England, and Raj believes her raw pace and grit could be pivotal in India’s World Cup campaign.09:07 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Vice-captaincy conundrumIf Gill is recalled, what happens to leadership hierarchy? Gill earlier served as Suryakumar’s deputy before Test duties. Axar Patel, now vice-captain, has been steady in the role. A reshuffle could create dressing-room unease, adding another layer to the Gill inclusion debate.08:59 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Top-Order congestionIndia’s biggest puzzle lies in the top three. Six names are in contention: Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson, Tilak Varma, Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and Sai Sudharsan. With all in good form, selectors must decide whether to reward consistency or make room for Gill’s star power. One change could unsettle the settled XI.08:52 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Selection Day DilemmaThe Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee meets today with one burning question: how to fit Shubman Gill into India’s in-form T20I setup. Under Suryakumar Yadav’s captaincy, India boast an 85% win record (17 wins in 20 matches), making the task of tweaking the batting order both risky and controversial.08:47 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Women's World Cup squad to be announced todayIndia’s recent run of victories has bolstered confidence but the women’s selection panel, headed by Neetu David, will face some tricky questions on the inclusion of Shafali Verma and pacer Renuka Thakur when it meets here on Tuesday to pick the squad for the ODI World Cup.Apart from Pakistan playing all their matches in Colombo, India will host the 50-over World Cup comprising eight teams from September 30 with their eyes firmly set on an elusive global trophy.

The tournament will follow the T20I format and feature eight teams competing across both venues, with Dubai hosting 11 matches and Abu Dhabi hosting eight fixtures."The players who will be selected will be the best for the country, and I am very proud of the way we are playing cricket, the way we played against England. We will win the Asia Cup," Sharma told reporters.The Asian Cricket Council has confirmed the participation of five full member nations - Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka - along with the UAE, Oman, and Hong Kong. The teams have been divided into two groups, with India, Pakistan, UAE, and Oman in Group A, while Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Hong Kong form Group B.08:06 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Top 2 T20I run-scorers for both India and Pakistan won't be part of Asia Cup 2025 - here is whyThe 2025 T20 Asia Cup is set to have a very different look, with the leading run-getters of both India and Pakistan missing from the tournament.For India, stalwarts Rohit Sharma (4,231 runs) and Virat Kohli (4,188 runs) have already bid farewell to T20 internationals. On the other hand, Pakistan’s selectors have taken a bold step by leaving out Babar Azam (4,223 runs) and Mohammad Rizwan (3,414 runs) from the 17-member squad announced on Sunday.Pakistan, under new captain Salman Ali Agha, will warm up for the Asia Cup with a tri-series against Afghanistan and the UAE in Sharjah from August 29 to September 7. The continental showpiece kicks off in the Emirates on September 9.The exclusion of Babar and Rizwan has triggered intense debate across cricketing circles, especially considering the pair played pivotal roles in Pakistan’s iconic 10-wicket victory over India at the 2021 T20 World Cup.READ FULL STORY07:36 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: 'Don’t make Vaibhav Suryavanshi wait'Former India skipper Kris Srikkanth has backed 14-year-old sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi for a place in India’s 15-member squad for the Asia Cup T20, which begins on September 9. His endorsement comes just days before the selectors meet on August 19 to finalise the squad, with stiff competition for spots—particularly at the top of the order.Vaibhav has rapidly risen as a serious contender after a breakout season in IPL 2025, where he amassed 252 runs in just seven matches for the Rajasthan Royals at a strike rate of over 200. His whirlwind 35-ball century against Gujarat Titans was the second-fastest ton in IPL history, further cementing his reputation as one of the brightest young batting talents.The teenager carried that momentum into the U19 tour of England, where he struck a century and impressed across both one-day and four-day formats, showcasing his adaptability and temperament at the highest junior level."You have to play bold. Don't make him wait. Don't say things like 'let him mature'. He is already playing with remarkable maturity. His shot-making has been on another level. If I were chairman, I would definitely have him in the squad," Srikkanth stated on his YouTube show.READ FULL STORY07:06 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: All you need to know!When and where will 15-member side be announced? DateTimingVenue confirmedThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will unveil its 15-member squad for the ACC Men’s Asia Cup 2025 on Tuesday, following a high-profile selection meeting in Mumbai. The Senior Men’s Selection Committee will gather at the BCCI headquarters, with the squad announcement scheduled for 1:30 PM (IST) on the 4th floor of the BCCI HQ.The press conference will be attended by India’s T20 captain and the chairman of selectors.The Asia Cup, to be played in the T20 format in the UAE from September 9 to 28, comes just a year after India lifted the 2024 T20 World Cup.Naturally, the spotlight is on continuity and trust in the young T20 specialists who powered India’s success.Suryakumar Yadav is expected to continue as captain, having cleared his fitness test at the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence.According to a report from TOI, star opener Shubman Gill, despite stellar Test and IPL performances, may find it difficult to break into the T20 side.With Sanju Samson, Abhishek Sharma, and Tilak Varma delivering consistently in the shortest format, the management is keen to back them. TOI understands that Gill remains in the selectors’ long-term plans, but not as a frontline T20 option.On the bowling front, Jasprit Bumrah is set to return after overcoming a minor knee concern, while Mohammed Siraj could be rested following a heavy workload in England.Arshdeep Singh, Hardik Pandya, and Prasidh Krishna are likely seam-bowling options, with spinners Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, and Washington Sundar in contention for the UAE’s slow pitches.India are grouped with Pakistan, UAE, and Oman in the Asia Cup.

Both would be keen to get their hands on leather and rattle the opposition.The two spinners come into the tournament with different recent history.Kuldeep spent the entire tour of England on the bench. Carrying drinks, passing on messages from the coaching staff, and quietly watching his teammates from the dressing room was all the chinaman managed over five Tests.Now, with the Asia Cup squad to be revealed on Tuesday (August 19), Kuldeep will be hoping to don the India blues, even if he didn't get the chance to wear the whites.The 30-year-old last featured in a T20I in the 2024 T20 World Cup, where he picked up 10 wickets in five matches. Overall, Kuldeep has played 40 T20Is, claiming 69 wickets, including two five-wicket hauls.Known for his deceptive wrong ’uns and sharp flippers, he remains a potent threat to batters, especially in UAE's spin-friendly conditions.While Kuldeep hasn’t played a T20I in the UAE, he has featured in ODIs there. He was also part of India’s victorious squads in the 2018 and 2023 editions of the Asia Cup (both in the ODI format).Varun Chakravarthy, meanwhile, has been in excellent form since making his international return last year.The 33-year-old mystery spinner, armed with nine different variations, has already produced match-winning spells, including two five-wicket hauls in T20Is and another in ODIs during India’s ICC Champions Trophy triumph.In his short T20I career so far, he has bagged 33 wickets in 18 matches.READ FULL STORY06:26 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: All-rounders and KeepersWith Nitish Kumar Reddy and Rishabh Pant still recovering from injuries, Shivam Dube is set to be the second seam-bowling all-rounder behind Pandya.

Conditions in Dubai and Abu Dhabi may not be as slow as in the Champions Trophy, but spin will still play a significant role.06:25 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Pacers’ PuzzleHardik Pandya doubles up as a frontline seamer alongside Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh, leaving one spot for a reserve quick. Harshit Rana is currently the frontrunner, with Prasidh Krishna and Mohammed Siraj seen more as red-ball specialists. With a home series against West Indies looming in October, Bumrah could even be rested, allowing Prasidh and Siraj opportunities.06:24 (IST) Aug 19India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: 'Sweet' headache for selectorsAs India’s selectors sit down on Tuesday to finalise the 15-member squad for the Asia Cup in the UAE, their biggest challenge could be fitting Shubman Gill into an already stable T20 set-up.Gill, who has enjoyed a stellar run as Test captain in England, has struggled to slot seamlessly into the current T20 combination.

Another possible casualty is Rinku Singh, whose finishing role has diminished under head coach Gautam Gambhir, who does not believe in the idea of a “designated finisher.”TrendingKagiso RabadaAUS vs SA Live ScoreSuryakumar YadavAbhishek SharmaIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIga SwiatekWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementCarlos AlcarazVarun ChakravarthyRohit SharmaKagiso RabadaAUS vs SA Live ScoreSuryakumar YadavAbhishek SharmaIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIga SwiatekWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementCarlos AlcarazVarun ChakravarthyRohit SharmaKagiso RabadaAUS vs SA Live ScoreSuryakumar YadavAbhishek SharmaIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIga SwiatekWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementCarlos AlcarazVarun ChakravarthyRohit SharmaTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTop Stories Right NowRussell Wilson's wife Ciara becomes first descendants of enslaved Africans to re...Stephen Curry’s wife Ayesha Curry shares an unforgettable moment of baby Cai wal...Maple Leafs fans on edge as Connor McDavid’s new contract update sparks speculat...More TOP StoriesQuick LinksWTC Points TableNHL NewsNBA NewsEsports and Gaming NewsLatest Cricket NewsWWE NewsCricket Match ScheduleInternational SportsMLB NewsNFL NewsEducation NewsLive Cricket ScoreExplore Every CornerAcross The GlobeIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementICAI CA Admit CardAUS vs SA LiveVP CandidateShubhanshu ShuklaMumbai RainsSimone TataAlaska MeetWang YiCP RadhakrishnanRahul GandhiZelenskyyHarjinder SinghGiorgia MeloniIsraeli Intel ChiefKristi NoemWWE Raw ResultsDubai Pink DiamondGST RatesWang YiUS Student VisaFASTag Annual PassBank Holidays AugustHamas CeasefireMumbai school closedRJS Prelims ResultStephanie WhiteTyson BagentConnor McDavidAbout usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesLiving and EntertainmentCricbuzzLifestyleNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTVTimes PrimeTravel DestinationsWhats HotETimesTimes LifeTimes PetsMyLifeXPServicesCouponDuniaTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgetsTimes EventsWork with UsColombiaHot on the WebAchyut Potdar Death NewsVitamins For Hair GrowthKidney Disease SymptomsCloves Health BenefitsReverse Fatty LiverTulsi Health BenefitsAbhinav ShuklaBlood Pressure ManagementAR MurugadossLongest International RiverSaswata ChatterjeeLow Value CurrencyLow CholesterolAmeesha PatelKidney Cancer SymptomsArmaan MalikCancer RiskJaanWorst States In AmericaFaissal KhanLiver Disease SymptomsAngelina JolieMonsoon Snake PreventionBlood Pressure ManagementWar 2 Box Office CollectionArchana Puran SinghCoolie Movie ReviewCoolie Box Office CollectionMahavatar Narsimha Box Office CollectionGarlic BenefitsDarshan ThoogudeepaColon Cancer SymptomsSanskrit EffectNatural SupplementsHigh Cholesterol SymptomsSide Effects Of Dragon FruitColorectal CancerOral SymptomsReduce Face Fat DietSide Effects Of BananasGinger Tea Side EffectsKidney Damage SymptomsTrending TopicsMadison BeerAdam SchefterNFL New DealTravis KelceDonald TrumpD GukeshUPSC EPFO RecruitmentWho is Anmoljit SinghMDSU BA SEM 1 ResultSBI PO Prelims ResultAbhishek SharmaAmbati RayuduRohit SharmaWho is Brian OkelleyNEET UG CounsellingBihar Jeevika RecruitmentWB NEET UG CounsellingNEET PG Result 2025Sarfaraz KhanDelhi Girl RescueMumbai Red AlertOperation SindoorMeerut Army Jawan AssaultedManish SisodiaSurat Phone in WashroomMumbai Travel AdvisoryMumbai RainsDwarka Expressway UER 2 InaugurationDelhi RapeAir India Flight NewsJeff BezosFastag Annual PassAnupam MittalGeoffrey HintonSridhar VembuApple iPhone 17Nyt ConnectionsMega Tsunami WarningAirtel DownJamie DimonWordle TodaySteve JobsPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth+ TipsIndian TV ShowsTechnologyTravelEtimesHealth & FitnessNFLAugust Long Weekend 2025India vs EnglandAstrologyWeather TodayPlatinum Rate TodaySilver Rate TodayGold Rate TodayIs Bank open todayIs Bank Open TomorrowBank Holidays in AugustPublic Holidays in AugustStock Market HolidaysFinancial CalculatorsTechnology NewsInternational SportsPublic HolidaysBank HolidaysLatest NewsUS Open 2025: Mixed doubles offers big names, big money and big question markUAE: Falcon prices hit $10,000 at Abu Dhabi auctions ahead of major hunting and equestrian expoNo 'harsh action' against strays till SC order: Delhi CM Rekha GuptaIs Vietnam going too far with its tax revolution?'Paradha' pre-release event: Director Praveen Kandregula says women-centric films deserve box office wins too - ReadHate crime in UK: Teenagers attack Sikh men, remove their turbans - videoThiruvananthapuram Medical College bars faculty from public criticism of govt policies, institutional matterAmbulance row: TN health minister Ma Subramanian slams Edappadi K Palaniswami over threat to staff;

Women's World Cup India Team Squad Live: Spotlight on Shafali Verma

The tournament, featuring eight teams, will begin September 30 with India hosting all matches except Pakistan's games, which will be played in Colombo.   India enters the World Cup with strong momentum after defeating England in white-ball series and winning the ODI tri-series involving Sri Lanka and South Africa in April. The team will also host Australia for three ODIs as part of their preparation.   The selectors face a crucial decision regarding Shafali Verma's inclusion in the batting lineup. Since her return against England, she has shown mixed form with scores of 3, 47, 31, and 75, followed by underwhelming performances against Australia A scoring 3, 3, and 41.   The current batting order appears settled with Smriti Mandhana and Pratika Rawal opening, supported by Jemimah Rodrigues, Harleen Deol, and captain Harmanpreet Kaur in the middle order.   Renuka Thakur's fitness assessment will be another key consideration. The premier seam bowler has been sidelined since March, and her recovery status will be evaluated considering the upcoming World Cup's workload demands.   Richa Ghosh is set to be the primary wicketkeeper, with Yastika Bhatia, who recently scored two fifties against Australia A in Brisbane, as a potential backup. 12:29 (IST) Aug 19Women's World Cup Squad Live: Tournament Details OutThe ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025 will run from September 30 to November 2.

Back then, for women’s cricket, that wasn’t normal. The players were shocked to see so many people,” she said, calling it a turning point for the women’s game in India.10:46 (IST) Aug 19Women's World Cup India Team Squad Live: Jemimah on WPL EffectWith 50 days to go for the ICC Women’s World Cup 2025, Jemimah Rodrigues credited the Women’s Premier League for giving young players the confidence to excel on the international stage. She highlighted pacer Kranti Gaud’s fearless bowling in England, where the 22-year-old emerged as the leading wicket-taker with nine scalps, including a stunning six-for.10:39 (IST) Aug 19Women's World Cup Squad Live:  Focus on Present, Not MilestonesFresh from series wins in England (2-1 T20Is, 3-2 ODIs), Mandhana stressed that the team is concentrating only on preparations. “Whenever we’ve done well, everything else has taken care of itself. We’ve had a camp, the England tour, and one more before the World Cup — that’s our focus,” she noted.10:21 (IST) Aug 19Women's World Cup Squad Live: Lessons from 2017 World CupMandhana recalled India’s memorable 2017 campaign, where she scored 232 runs, including a century vs West Indies. “We all remember that World Cup… Harmanpreet’s 171, everyone’s contribution.

We know where to work hard and how to implement,” she told ICC.09:45 (IST) Aug 19Women's World Cup Squad Live: Confidence from recent winsWith India set to open their campaign against Sri Lanka on September 30 in Bengaluru, Harmanpreet believes the team carries strong momentum. “The confidence is very high. The kind of cricket we have played over the last couple of years, especially in England, gives us a lot of belief,” the skipper said recently.Don't missanything!Subscribe to our newsletter and get all the stories that matter delivered to your inboxInvalid id.

At the time I didn’t realise its impact, but when we came back, the support we received was overwhelming,” she said.09:18 (IST) Aug 19Women's World Cup Squad Live: Harmanpreet’s world cup missionIndia captain Harmanpreet Kaur says her approach to the upcoming ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup will be “the same as my first ODI World Cup” — to enjoy her game while giving 100%. Leading in her maiden World Cup as skipper, Kaur is determined to “break that final barrier” and deliver India’s first senior ICC trophy.09:02 (IST) Aug 19Women's World Cup Squad Live: Winning at home would be hugeMithali stressed that clinching the Cup in India would be a landmark moment for women’s cricket in the country. “We’ve come close twice, but never lifted it.

Deepti Sharma, Sneh Rana and Radha Yadav remain the frontline options, while youngster N Shree Charani impressed in T20Is against England. The selectors must balance experience with youth in India’s spin-heavy arsenal.08:41 (IST) Aug 19Women's World Cup India Team Squad Live: Renuka Thakur’s Fitness TestThe status of pacer Renuka Thakur is a major concern. Out since March with injury, the right-arm quick could prove crucial with the new ball in Indian conditions. The upcoming ODI series against Australia may act as her comeback stage, provided she clears fitness and workload assessments.08:40 (IST) Aug 19Women's World Cup India Team Squad Live: Spotlight on Shafali VermaShafali Verma’s inclusion remains the talking point. Since her return against England, she scored 3, 47, 31 and 75, but faltered in the Australia A series with twin failures (3, 3, 41).

Stay tuned. Women's World Cup India Team Squad Live: The selection committee led by Neetu David is set to announce India's Women's ODI World Cup squad and the team for the three-match home ODI series against Australia on Tuesday afternoon. The same squad is likely to be chosen for both events, with only minimal changes possible based on the decisions of the five-member selection committee and team management.

The selection committee is also expected to pick an India A team for the World Cup warm-up game against South Africa at the BCCI Centre of Excellence Ground in Bengaluru.

The first two women's ODIs between India and Australia will be held at the Mullanpur stadium on September 14 and 17, followed by the final match at New Delhi's Arun Jaitley Stadium on September 20.

Mullanpur will host women's international cricket for the first time, while New Delhi will stage a women's ODI after nearly 28 years.

The Indian team, under Harmanpreet Kaur's leadership, enters its final World Cup preparation phase after successful ODI tri-series victory in Sri Lanka and white-ball series wins in England.

Smriti Mandhana, Harmanpreet Kaur, Jemimah Rodrigues, and Richa Ghosh are confirmed for the batting lineup. Pratika Rawal, who has scored 703 runs since her debut last year, and Harleen Deol are likely to continue, with Yastika Bhatia as second wicketkeeper.

Shafali Verma's selection remains uncertain due to inconsistent performance. Despite head coach Amol Muzumdar indicating her consideration for World Cup selection, her recent scores in Australia have been modest.

Amanjot Kaur, who replaced the injured Pooja Vastrakar, faces careful workload management due to a back injury from the England ODI series. While cleared to play, she might be reserved for crucial World Cup matches.TrendingKagiso RabadaAUS vs SA Live ScoreSuryakumar YadavAbhishek SharmaIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIga SwiatekWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementCarlos AlcarazVarun ChakravarthyRohit SharmaKagiso RabadaAUS vs SA Live ScoreSuryakumar YadavAbhishek SharmaIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIga SwiatekWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementCarlos AlcarazVarun ChakravarthyRohit SharmaKagiso RabadaAUS vs SA Live ScoreSuryakumar YadavAbhishek SharmaIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIga SwiatekWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementCarlos AlcarazVarun ChakravarthyRohit SharmaTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTop Stories Right NowRussell Wilson's wife Ciara becomes first descendants of enslaved Africans to re...Stephen Curry’s wife Ayesha Curry shares an unforgettable moment of baby Cai wal...Maple Leafs fans on edge as Connor McDavid’s new contract update sparks speculat...More TOP StoriesQuick LinksWTC Points TableNHL NewsNBA NewsEsports and Gaming NewsLatest Cricket NewsWWE NewsCricket Match ScheduleInternational SportsMLB NewsNFL NewsEducation NewsLive Cricket ScoreExplore Every CornerAcross The GlobeIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementICAI CA Admit CardAUS vs SA LiveVP CandidateShubhanshu ShuklaMumbai RainsSimone TataAlaska MeetWang YiCP RadhakrishnanRahul GandhiZelenskyyHarjinder SinghGiorgia MeloniIsraeli Intel ChiefKristi NoemWWE Raw ResultsDubai Pink DiamondGST RatesWang YiUS Student VisaFASTag Annual PassBank Holidays AugustHamas CeasefireMumbai school closedRJS Prelims ResultStephanie WhiteTyson BagentConnor McDavidAbout usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesLiving and EntertainmentCricbuzzLifestyleNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTVTimes PrimeTravel DestinationsWhats HotETimesTimes LifeTimes PetsMyLifeXPServicesCouponDuniaTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgetsTimes EventsWork with UsColombiaHot on the WebAchyut Potdar Death NewsVitamins For Hair GrowthKidney Disease SymptomsCloves Health BenefitsReverse Fatty LiverTulsi Health BenefitsAbhinav ShuklaBlood Pressure ManagementAR MurugadossLongest International RiverSaswata ChatterjeeLow Value CurrencyLow CholesterolAmeesha PatelKidney Cancer SymptomsArmaan MalikCancer RiskJaanWorst States In AmericaFaissal KhanLiver Disease SymptomsAngelina JolieMonsoon Snake PreventionBlood Pressure ManagementWar 2 Box Office CollectionArchana Puran SinghCoolie Movie ReviewCoolie Box Office CollectionMahavatar Narsimha Box Office CollectionGarlic BenefitsDarshan ThoogudeepaColon Cancer SymptomsSanskrit EffectNatural SupplementsHigh Cholesterol SymptomsSide Effects Of Dragon FruitColorectal CancerOral SymptomsReduce Face Fat DietSide Effects Of BananasGinger Tea Side EffectsKidney Damage SymptomsTrending TopicsMadison BeerAdam SchefterNFL New DealTravis KelceDonald TrumpD GukeshUPSC EPFO RecruitmentWho is Anmoljit SinghMDSU BA SEM 1 ResultSBI PO Prelims ResultAbhishek SharmaAmbati RayuduRohit SharmaWho is Brian OkelleyNEET UG CounsellingBihar Jeevika RecruitmentWB NEET UG CounsellingNEET PG Result 2025Sarfaraz KhanDelhi Girl RescueMumbai Red AlertOperation SindoorMeerut Army Jawan AssaultedManish SisodiaSurat Phone in WashroomMumbai Travel AdvisoryMumbai RainsDwarka Expressway UER 2 InaugurationDelhi RapeAir India Flight NewsJeff BezosFastag Annual PassAnupam MittalGeoffrey HintonSridhar VembuApple iPhone 17Nyt ConnectionsMega Tsunami WarningAirtel DownJamie DimonWordle TodaySteve JobsPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth+ TipsIndian TV ShowsTechnologyTravelEtimesHealth & FitnessNFLAugust Long Weekend 2025India vs EnglandAstrologyWeather TodayPlatinum Rate TodaySilver Rate TodayGold Rate TodayIs Bank open todayIs Bank Open TomorrowBank Holidays in AugustPublic Holidays in AugustStock Market HolidaysFinancial CalculatorsTechnology NewsInternational SportsPublic HolidaysBank HolidaysLatest NewsUS Open 2025: Mixed doubles offers big names, big money and big question markUAE: Falcon prices hit $10,000 at Abu Dhabi auctions ahead of major hunting and equestrian expoNo 'harsh action' against strays till SC order: Delhi CM Rekha GuptaIs Vietnam going too far with its tax revolution?'Paradha' pre-release event: Director Praveen Kandregula says women-centric films deserve box office wins too - ReadHate crime in UK: Teenagers attack Sikh men, remove their turbans - videoThiruvananthapuram Medical College bars faculty from public criticism of govt policies, institutional matterAmbulance row: TN health minister Ma Subramanian slams Edappadi K Palaniswami over threat to staff;

Marsh, who led Australia to a 2-1 victory in the T20I series, will continue his captaincy role as regular captain Pat Cummins takes a rest.   The Australian team successfully implemented an attacking strategy from the start in the T20I series, though it occasionally resulted in batting collapses.   "Getting ready to spend three and a half hours in the field will be a little bit different for a few of the boys. But as a group and as a whole, nothing really changes. (There's a) bit of a mindset change, it's obviously different format. But the same stuff rolls on," Marsh told reporters on Monday.   Marsh has experience leading Australia in ODIs, having captained nine times previously, including tours to South Africa in 2023 and England in 2024 when Cummins was unavailable.   The Australian captain suggested they might continue their preference for chasing targets in the ODI series, similar to their T20I approach.   "It's a bit of a common trend, generally speaking, in T20 cricket these days. You get to assess the conditions, but you also just know what you're chasing. I'm certainly not afraid to bat first. But we have lent towards bowling first. Playing with dew is not something that we're used to in Australia. We saw the ball get really soft in Darwin. That's been a different challenge for us," he elaborated.   The ODI series will continue with the second and third matches scheduled at the Great Barrier Reef Arena in Mackay on Friday and Sunday.

Australia have shown good discipline with the ball as spin has been effective, and a few chances here and there have been created. However, the Aussies haven't been able to string wickets in clusters, which has allowed the Proteas to string partnerships. With 8 wickets in hand and a couple of proper hitters yet to come, the tourists seem to be off to a big total on a slow pitch. Currently, this stand between Matthew Breetzke and skipper Temba Bavuma has stitched together 53 runs, and Australia are in search of a breakthrough. A couple of quick wickets moving towards the climax of the innings could prove handy. But they need them now. A change in bowling as Aaron Hardie returns for another spell. He is 1-0-13-0 so far. Also, as per the new ICC rules, it seems like Australia have picked one ball of the two to continue till the end of the innings. 12:19 (IST) Aug 19Score after 34 overs 184 - 2Runs Scored: 0 004001Matthew Breetzke 36 (36)Temba Bavuma 31 (44)Nathan Ellis5-0-27-01Overs33.6Score184 - 2 Nathan Ellis to Matthew Breetzke, Length ball, angled into off and middle, Breetzke is late on the shot but jams his bat down in time and gets it in front of point for a single.12:19 (IST) Aug 190Overs33.5Score183 - 2 Nathan Ellis to Matthew Breetzke, This one stays low!

Following his impressive performance in the T20I series, Brevis' entry marks South Africa's preparation for the 2027 ODI World Cup, which they will co-host with Zimbabwe and Namibia.

Temba Bavuma, fresh from lifting the World Test Championship mace at Lord's, will lead the South African side. The team sees the return of Keshav Maharaj in the spin department, while Bavuma has confirmed his position at No. 3 in the batting order.

Wiaan Mulder seeks to build on his bowling success from the Champions Trophy as he aims to cement his place in the 50-over format.

The Australian team faces lineup changes due to injuries to Matt Short, Mitchell Owen, and Lance Morris. This has created opportunities for newcomers Cooper Connolly, Aaron Hardie, and Matt Kuhnemann.

Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc will not participate in the series. Marnus Labuschagne returns to the squad, looking to revive his international career after being dropped from the Test side earlier this year.

Mitchell Marsh will captain the Australian side. He has indicated a preference for bowling first after winning the toss, though dew conditions in Cairns may affect this decision.

The venue's history suggests challenging batting conditions. Previous ODIs between Australia and New Zealand in 2022 saw totals rarely exceeding 267, favoring the bowling sides.

Cameron Green, who scored his highest ODI score of 89 not out at this ground, is expected to play a key role, potentially batting at No. 3.

With three matches scheduled over five days, Australia plans to rotate their fast bowlers, giving South Africa varying bowling combinations to face.

Brevis, known for his aggressive batting style and ability to hit boundaries, represents South Africa's future in ODI cricket as they begin their journey toward the 2027 World Cup.

The series presents an opportunity for both teams to test new talent while maintaining competitive standards in this established cricket rivalry.TrendingKagiso RabadaAUS vs SA Live ScoreSuryakumar YadavAbhishek SharmaIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIga SwiatekWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementCarlos AlcarazVarun ChakravarthyRohit SharmaKagiso RabadaAUS vs SA Live ScoreSuryakumar YadavAbhishek SharmaIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIga SwiatekWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementCarlos AlcarazVarun ChakravarthyRohit SharmaKagiso RabadaAUS vs SA Live ScoreSuryakumar YadavAbhishek SharmaIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIga SwiatekWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementCarlos AlcarazVarun ChakravarthyRohit SharmaTired of too many ads?go ad free nowMatch StatisticsHead to Head in ODITotal Matches 1105155VenueCazaly's Stadium, CairnsAUS PLAYING XIMitchell Marsh (C)Travis HeadMarnus LabuschagneSee AllSA PLAYING XIAiden MarkramRyan Rickelton (W)Temba Bavuma (C)See AllTop Stories Right NowRussell Wilson's wife Ciara becomes first descendants of enslaved Africans to re...Stephen Curry’s wife Ayesha Curry shares an unforgettable moment of baby Cai wal...Maple Leafs fans on edge as Connor McDavid’s new contract update sparks speculat...More TOP StoriesQuick LinksWTC Points TableNHL NewsNBA NewsEsports and Gaming NewsLatest Cricket NewsWWE NewsCricket Match ScheduleInternational SportsMLB NewsNFL NewsEducation NewsLive Cricket ScoreExplore Every CornerAcross The GlobeIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementWomen ODI WC Squad AnnouncementICAI CA Admit CardAUS vs SA LiveVP CandidateShubhanshu ShuklaMumbai RainsSimone TataAlaska MeetWang YiCP RadhakrishnanRahul GandhiZelenskyyHarjinder SinghGiorgia MeloniIsraeli Intel ChiefKristi NoemWWE Raw ResultsDubai Pink DiamondGST RatesWang YiUS Student VisaFASTag Annual PassBank Holidays AugustHamas CeasefireMumbai school closedBattlefield 6Stephanie WhiteTyson BagentConnor McDavidAbout usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesLiving and EntertainmentCricbuzzLifestyleNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTVTimes PrimeTravel DestinationsWhats HotETimesTimes LifeTimes PetsMyLifeXPServicesCouponDuniaTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgetsTimes EventsWork with UsColombiaHot on the WebAchyut Potdar Death NewsVitamins For Hair GrowthKidney Disease SymptomsCloves Health BenefitsReverse Fatty LiverTulsi Health BenefitsAbhinav ShuklaBlood Pressure ManagementAR MurugadossLongest International RiverSaswata ChatterjeeLow Value CurrencyLow CholesterolAmeesha PatelKidney Cancer SymptomsArmaan MalikCancer RiskJaanWorst States In AmericaFaissal KhanLiver Disease SymptomsAngelina JolieMonsoon Snake PreventionBlood Pressure ManagementWar 2 Box Office CollectionArchana Puran SinghCoolie Movie ReviewCoolie Box Office CollectionMahavatar Narsimha Box Office CollectionGarlic BenefitsDarshan ThoogudeepaColon Cancer SymptomsSanskrit EffectNatural SupplementsHigh Cholesterol SymptomsSide Effects Of Dragon FruitColorectal CancerOral SymptomsReduce Face Fat DietSide Effects Of BananasGinger Tea Side EffectsKidney Damage SymptomsTrending TopicsMadison BeerAdam SchefterNFL New DealTravis KelceDonald TrumpKelly StaffordUPSC EPFO RecruitmentWho is Anmoljit SinghMDSU BA SEM 1 ResultSBI PO Prelims ResultAbhishek SharmaAmbati RayuduRohit SharmaWho is Brian OkelleyNEET UG CounsellingBihar Jeevika RecruitmentWB NEET UG CounsellingNEET PG Result 2025Sarfaraz KhanDelhi Girl RescueMumbai Red AlertOperation SindoorMeerut Army Jawan AssaultedManish SisodiaSurat Phone in WashroomMumbai Travel AdvisoryMumbai RainsDwarka Expressway UER 2 InaugurationDelhi RapeAir India Flight NewsJeff BezosFastag Annual PassAnupam MittalGeoffrey HintonSridhar VembuApple iPhone 17Nyt ConnectionsMega Tsunami WarningAirtel DownJamie DimonWordle TodaySteve JobsPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth+ TipsIndian TV ShowsTechnologyTravelEtimesHealth & FitnessNFLAugust Long Weekend 2025India vs EnglandAstrologyWeather TodayPlatinum Rate TodaySilver Rate TodayGold Rate TodayIs Bank open todayIs Bank Open TomorrowBank Holidays in AugustPublic Holidays in AugustStock Market HolidaysFinancial CalculatorsTechnology NewsInternational SportsPublic HolidaysBank HolidaysLatest NewsAugust 2025’s night sky will sparkle with 1,00,000 stars at once: Know when and where to watchRJS 2025 prelims result out on hcraj.nic.in;

Revelation! 'Pushed the rope backwards': Ex-cricketer on Surya's catch
Ambati Rayudu has revealed that the boundary rope in the T20 World Cup final between India and South Africa was unintentionally moved back due to broadcast equipment. This adjustment, according to Rayudu, played a crucial role in Suryakumar Yadav's catch to dismiss David Miller. Despite the controversy, Rayudu maintains the catch was legitimate, attributing India's triumph to divine intervention.

Despite the controversy, Rayudu maintains the catch was legitimate, attributing India's triumph to divine intervention. Suryakumar Yadav NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Ambati Rayudu has shed new light on one of the most debated moments from the T20 World Cup 2024 final between India and South Africa — Suryakumar Yadav’s boundary catch to dismiss David Miller. According to Rayudu, the catch became possible because the boundary rope had been unintentionally pushed back earlier in the day when broadcast equipment was placed near the rope.Rayudu’s revelation comes more than a year after India’s title-winning final against South Africa, where Suryakumar’s stunning effort at the boundary was remembered as one of the defining moments.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!EXCLUSIVE: India to boycott Pakistan in Asia Cup? Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'The dismissal, which turned out to be a defining moment in India’s triumph, drew scrutiny when replays showed the rope appeared to be positioned differently than usual.Speaking on the Unfiltered Podcast, Rayudu, who was part of the commentary team during the final, explained: "There were world feed commentators. During the break, what usually happens is they put a chair there and a screen in order to help the broadcasters see what is happening. That is why they pushed the rope backwards a little bit. But, they left it like that (even after taking the screen and the chair away). That is how the boundary became a little bigger for us. We (the commentators) could see it from above. It was god's plan."When asked whether the shot would have cleared the boundary under normal circumstances, Rayudu replied:PollDo you agree with Rayudu's statement that 'God was with us'?Yes, it's a matter of fateNo, skill was the deciding factorI think it's a mix of bothI don't believe in fate"I don't know if it was a six (in natural circumstances) or not. If the rope had been placed at its normal position, maybe Surya would've run from inside."Despite the controversy, Rayudu insisted the dismissal was legitimate. "End of the day, God was with us," he said, adding that it was a “clean catch.”The rope placement sparked reactions from several current and former cricketers at the time, though the debate eventually faded.

The tournament, scheduled in the UAE from September 9–28, will be played in the T20I format, making it an important stepping stone towards the T20 World Cup next year.LIVE: Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementIndia, placed in Group A alongside Pakistan, UAE, and Oman, will be watched closely as the selectors look to strike the balance between experience and youth. One name, however, should not even be up for debate — Abhishek Sharma.EXCLUSIVE: India to boycott Pakistan in Asia Cup? Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'From IPL sensation to India’s T20I spearheadAbhishek Sharma’s case for selection writes itself. His rise has been meteoric since his breakthrough IPL 2024 season for Sunrisers Hyderabad, where he hammered 484 runs at a staggering strike rate of 204.21.And if anyone thought 2024 was a one-off, Abhishek proved them wrong with another breathtaking IPL in 2025: 439 runs, which included a highest score of 141, at another stunning strike rate of 193.39. PollDo you believe the selectors should prioritize experience over youth in the squad selection?Yes, experience is crucialNo, youth brings energyThat form translated to the international stage almost instantly. After an anticlimactic four-ball duck on debut against Zimbabwe in July 2024, he responded with a jaw-dropping 100 off 47 balls in the very next match. Since then, the 24-year-old left-hander has not looked back, cementing his place at the top of India’s T20I order.Fast forward a year, and Abhishek sits at the very top of the ICC T20I batting rankings, making him the youngest Indian ever to achieve the No. 1 status in the format. He currently leads the chart ahead of compatriots Tilak Varma (No.2) and Suryakumar Yadav (No.6). That alone is a telling indicator of his indispensability.The numbers don’t lieIndia batter Abhishek Sharma. In 16 T20I innings for India, Abhishek has amassed 535 runs at a blistering strike rate of 193.85 — the highest for any Indian with over 500 runs in the format. His record already features two centuries and two fifties, underlining his ability to provide explosive starts and play match-winning knocks.His most recent masterpiece came against England at the Wankhede Stadium, where he smashed a record-breaking 135 off 54 balls — the highest individual T20I score by an Indian. That innings included 13 sixes and showcased his unmatched ability to dismantle world-class bowling.Crucially, Abhishek has formed a formidable opening partnership with Sanju Samson. Since being paired together against Bangladesh in October 2024, the duo have opened in 12 consecutive matches, giving India explosive starts almost every time.Abhishek Sharma in last 12 T20Is: 411 runs @34.25, SR 200.49 (2 fifties, 1 hundred)Sanju Samson in last 12 T20Is: 417 runs @37.91, SR 183.70 (3 hundreds)India’s record with Abhishek-Samson opening: 10 wins in 12 matchesThese numbers reflect not just individual brilliance but also a stable, high-impact opening formula that has worked wonders for India. The competition: Shubman Gill and Yashasvi JaiswalAbhishek Sharma, Shubman Gill and Yashasvi JaiswalThe selection dilemma lies in who joins Abhishek and Samson as the third opener. Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill, both coming off a prolific Test series in England, will stake their claims. But their T20I credentials have faded in comparison.Jaiswal’s last T20I: July 2024 vs Sri Lanka (10 off 9).Gill’s last T20I: Same match, scoring 39 off 37.Neither has played a T20I in more than a year, while Abhishek has established himself as India’s most consistent powerplay batter. Given the contrasting trajectories, the selectors may consider carrying either Gill or Jaiswal as backup, but dislodging Abhishek is not an option.Why Abhishek Sharma is non-negotiableWorld No.1 T20I batter – His ranking is a reflection of dominance across opponents and conditions.Explosive strike rate – At nearly 194 in internationals and 193.39 in IPL 2025, his scoring rate dwarfs not just Indian contemporaries but also most global stars.Big-match temperament – Two T20I hundreds already, including a record knock against England, underline his ability to step up.Proven opening partnership – The Abhishek-Samson duo has become India’s most reliable T20I opening combo in recent years.Consistency – Back-to-back stellar IPL seasons, apart from international success, have made him the most bankable young T20 batter in India.As India gear up for the Asia Cup, much chatter will swirl around Shubman Gill’s return, Yashasvi Jaiswal’s case, or middle-order reshuffles. But in the opening slot, there is no ambiguity. Abhishek Sharma has evolved from a promising IPL star into India’s T20I batting spearhead, with numbers, form, and rankings all backing his claim.The selectors may face tough calls in other departments, but when it comes to Abhishek, the decision is straightforward. He is not just a part of India’s Asia Cup squad — he is the foundation on which their T20 future must be built.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy  NEW DELHI: The spin duo of Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy will be eagerly awaiting the selectors’ call as India’s squad for the Asia Cup 2025, scheduled from September 9, is set to be announced.

SUBSCRIBE NOW!EXCLUSIVE: India to boycott Pakistan in Asia Cup? Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'Kuldeep spent the entire tour of England on the bench. Carrying drinks, passing on messages from the coaching staff, and quietly watching his teammates from the dressing room was all the chinaman managed over five Tests.Now, with the Asia Cup squad to be revealed on Tuesday (August 19), Kuldeep will be hoping to don the India blues, even if he didn't get the chance to wear the whites.The 30-year-old last featured in a T20I in the 2024 T20 World Cup, where he picked up 10 wickets in five matches. Overall, Kuldeep has played 40 T20Is, claiming 69 wickets, including two five-wicket hauls.Known for his deceptive wrong ’uns and sharp flippers, he remains a potent threat to batters, especially in UAE's spin-friendly conditions.While Kuldeep hasn’t played a T20I in the UAE, he has featured in ODIs there.

Kuldeep was sad too. But I told him — whatever has gone is gone, it’s time to look forward. He is really looking forward to a chance in the Asia Cup. He is hungry for wickets. India will benefit hugely from Kuldeep. And if he forms a combo with Varun, then the opposition will have a tough time. Varun is a solid bowler. They both complement each other when on the field," Kapil told TimesofIndia.com."Opposition teams were scared of Kuldeep, and now they are scared of Varun too. If India play Pakistan, it will be a night to remember. These two guys will completely outfox them. They will not give them time to think. Kuldeep is very hungry right now," the coach added.India have been placed in Group A alongside Oman, hosts UAE, and arch-rivals Pakistan. Group B consists of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, and Sri Lanka.With the Asia Cup followed by the 2026 T20 World Cup, the tournament provides both Kuldeep and Varun with the perfect opportunity to stake their claim for long-term spots in India’s T20I setup.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

His innings helped Mumbai post a strong total. Suved Parkar and Aakash Parkar also contributed with half-centuries. Sarfaraz's performance highlights his determination to regain a spot in the Indian Test team. Sarfaraz Khan (PTI Photo) CHENNAI: When some of his Mumbai teammates and TNCA XI players were waiting for the curtains to come down following a rain interruption towards the end of Monday’s play, Sarfaraz Khan was itching to get back on the field. Sarfaraz, who had retired hurt with cramps after smashing 138 (114 balls, 10x4, 6x6), had his pads on and was craving for more on the opening day of the Buchi Babu invitational red-ball tournament at the Gojan ‘B’ Ground here. Courtesy of his stroke-filled ton and halfcenturies from Suved Parkar (72) and Aakash Parkar (67 not out), Mumbai posted a handsome first-innings score of 367-5 at stumps. How Virat Kohli & Ravi Shastri sparked India's Test revolution | Insights from Bharat Arun | #BSEGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!The hunger that Sarfaraz showed reflected the burning desire which he has to get back to India’s Test set-up. The 27-year-old only warmed the bench during the BorderGavaskar Trophy in Australia and was ignored for the recent tour to England. Playing his first competitive longformat match since turning out for India ‘A’ against England Lions, the right-hander, on Monday, was fully immersed in the task of accumulating runs. So much so that he had to be informed by his teammates after completing his century on the stroke of tea. The Mumbai batter brought up his milestone with a Virender Sehwag-esque upper cut over the wicketkeeper’s head, which resulted in a boundary. Up against a not-so-strong bowling attack, Sarfaraz made TNCA XI pay heavily for their drops. He was handed reprieves – both off left-arm spinner M Siddharth’s bowling – on 15 and 121 before deciding to leave the field with cramps. Sarfaraz was particularly severe on the two slow bowlers, Siddharth (he hit him for 49 runs off 42 balls) and off-spinning allrounder Mohamed Ali (28 off 14 balls), as he treated them with disdain. He used his slog-sweeps to good effect to collect many fours in the square leg-midwicket region while opting to access the ‘V’ when trying to clear the fence. Besides his attractive strokemaking, what caught the eye was his eagerness to run hard between the wickets. He put his speed boots on quite a few times, one of the notable moments being him pinching a single a few minutes before suffering a minor setback. Having a leaner frame, a result of his recent transformation, may have helped him in the cause. Sarfaraz, once overlooked by the national selectors for fitness issues despite amassing loads of runs, shed about 17 kgs in a short time in his bid to once again climb to the top. Sarfaraz’s brother Musheer Khan hailed him for putting on another good show. “My bhai has made it a habit to hit tons. We have a good score and hope to score more in the remaining overs (on Tuesday),” Musheer said in a post-day chat.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

"It's always exciting when you see the young faces. Obviously, the big talk has been on Brevis, (he's been) putting up his hand and showing what he is capable of.

For India, Rohit Sharma (4,231 runs) and Virat Kohli (4,188 runs) have already retired from T20 internationals, while Pakistan’s selectors made the bold call to omit Babar Azam (4,223 runs) and Mohammad Rizwan (3,414 runs) from their 17-member squad announced on Sunday.Pakistan, led by Salman Ali Agha, will play a preparatory tri-series against Afghanistan and UAE in Sharjah from August 29 to September 7 before the Asia Cup begins in the Emirates on September 9.

Calling this a “new era” without Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, Harbhajan praised the youngsters for carrying forward Indian cricket’s legacy. India's player of the series India's captain Shubman Gill on day five of the fifth cricket test match between England and India at The Kia Oval in London, Monday, Aug. 4, 2025. (AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) NEW DELHI: The Asia Cup 2025 India squad is set to be announced, and the burning question is whether Test captain Shubman Gill will find a place in the team. With India’s T20I batting lineup already packed with hard-hitters like Abhishek Sharma, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson, Tilak Varma, captain Suryakumar Yadav, and Hardik Pandya, the selectors face a “sweet headache” when it comes to Gill’s inclusion.India’s top six T20I batters boast impressive strike rates: Abhishek Sharma (193.84), Suryakumar Yadav (167.07), Yashasvi Jaiswal (164.31), Hardik Pandya (141.67), Tilak Varma (155.07), and Sanju Samson (152.38).Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!In comparison, Gill has played 21 T20Is so far, with a strike rate of 139.27.So, will the selectors still back Shubman?Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh, who has closely observed Gill, strongly believes the youngster deserves a place in the squad.“In the T20 format, it’s important to understand that it’s not just about big hitting. If Shubman decides to attack, he can match anyone, because he is a very solid player with strong basics. A batter with such a strong foundation can score runs in any format," Harbhajan told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview."If you look at the IPL, Shubman has scored runs every season. He has worn the Orange Cap — and that doesn’t happen by chance. And it’s not like he bats only at a strike rate of 120 or 130; he can also bat at a strike rate of 160," he added."Yes, we do have players like Abhishek Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, and Tilak Varma, but you cannot undermine or underestimate Shubman Gill. He is a very talented batter who can adapt to any format. He is an all-format player. In my opinion, he can play T20s and even dominate the format. We as fans are used to seeing fours and sixes every ball, but you also need batters who can play long innings and rescue the team when required,” Harbhajan said.When asked to name his 15 for the Asia Cup, which is set to be picked on Tuesday, Harbhajan replied: "I think the squad should be: Yashasvi Jaiswal, Abhishek Sharma, Shubman Gill, Suryakumar Yadav – the captain, Hardik Pandya, Shreyas Iyer, Washington Sundar, Riyan Parag for the middle order, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Mohammed Siraj, Arshdeep Singh, KL Rahul, Jasprit Bumrah and Rishabh Pant.”'CRICKET NEVER STOPS FOR ANYONE'The Asia Cup will mark India’s first major multi-team tournament without stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. The duo featured in India’s previous two global triumphs — the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 and the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 — both won under Rohit’s leadership.This, as Harbhajan puts it, is the beginning of a new era.“See, cricket never stops for anyone. Whether we talk about the time of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, or Sachin Tendulkar, the game has always gone on. Someone or the other comes in and takes the team forward. Right now, the way Shubman Gill and his team-mates have played in England… Rohit and Virat have left their legacy in the right hands. We have seen the shift happen smoothly. It will be a big tournament that will be played without Virat and Rohit," Harbhajan said.PollShould Shubman Gill be included in the Asia Cup 2025 squad?Yes, he deserves a spotNo, we have better options"The way these youngsters have taken responsibility… I believe this is the natural rule of life — change is inevitable. If there is no change, things become stagnant. Moving forward is always good. And the way Shubman Gill and his team-mates have performed, it’s really pleasing to see."Of course, we have seen this shift earlier as well. When the big players move on, someone else steps up, takes responsibility, and carries the team forward. As long as the team keeps moving in the right direction, that is the main goal. The way Gill and his team have played in England, Rohit and Virat have definitely left their legacy in safe hands,” he added.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

He emphasizes the importance of long-term planning for Bumrah's career. Gloster highlights Bumrah's support system and his positive return from injury. He suggests prioritizing Bumrah's longevity over immediate series appearances. Gloster believes Bumrah's management will benefit both the player and Indian cricket. India's Jasprit Bumrah celebrates with teammate Washington Sundar (PTI Photo/R Senthilkumar) Mumbai: At a time when there’s a raging debate amongst former cricketers and journalists around India’s ace pacer Jasprit Bumrah’s workload, following his appearance in just three out of five Tests in the recently held series in England to manage his workload, former Team India physio John Gloster has offered an interesting perspective. Replying to a question on whether Bumrah should be given leeway in choosing which games he would play in a series/tournament, Glosters said, “Look, I know that's a very controversial topic at the moment, and I'll happily tackle most controversial topics. I think that the athlete at the end of the day knows themselves better than anybody.”How Jasprit Bumrah is preparing for Lord's Test - batting, bowling and lot of jokes!Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Speaking at a book launch at the Cricket Club of India on Monday, Gloster said, “Most athletes these days who have good sports teams around them are taking advice from those people. But intuitively, most athletes know what's right and what's wrong. And he is a mature athlete. He’s a smart individual who knows exactly what he’s doing.” The 31-year-old Bumrah took 14 wickets in three Tests at 26.00 in the Tendulkar-Anderson Trophy, and was under fire for missing the crucial third and fifth Tests of the series due to workload management. Overall, Bumrah has taken 219 wickets in 48 Tests at 19.82, with 15 five-wicket hauls, and is set to feature in the Asia Cup, which Gloster felt “should not be a problem, since the tournament will be played in a T20 format and Bumrah has to bowl only four overs in a match.” Making a pertinent point about the need to manage Bumrah’s workload to ensure that he lasts for more years rather than just focusing on how he could play more and more matches in a series, which could put him at risk of burnout or injury, Gloster said, “And I think nine times out of ten, mature athletes who have good support are going to make the right decisions. And what we need to think about is not Bumrah for the next series or the series after that. We've got to think about Bumrah for the next two to three years.”PollHow important is workload management for professional athletes?Very importantSomewhat importantNot importantUnsure “In Jasprit's case, he had significant success when he came back. With the type of injury that he had, or has, he always knew that there were going to be times when it would need to be managed differently in order for him to continue to have success and stay playing at the highest level. And it is through good counsel that he comes to terms with that.” Gloster pointed out that it was crucial in Bumrah’s case that he received the right guidance in terms of his workload and injury management, which meant that a lot of times, there could be “others taking decisions for him,” in order for him to have a long and successful career in international cricket. “He knows that his career and the length of his career, his sporting longevity, is going to be through sound counsel and sound advice. This is what it's going to be like. And he knows that there are going to be situations where others are going to have to make decisions for him in order for him to have the best and longest career that he's going to have,” Gloster said.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

His international record shows steady progress, but it was IPL 2025 where he found good rhythm. Turning out for Gujarat Titans, Gill scored 650 runs in 15 innings, giving his team consistent starts at the top. For India, however, the opening slots are currently held by Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson, who have partnered each other in the last 12 T20Is. This means Gill will need to push his case strongly to break into the top order.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Kris Srikkanth, former India captain, has surprisingly advocated for 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi's inclusion in the Asia Cup T20 squad. Suryavanshi's impressive IPL 2025 performance and U19 tour of England have made him a strong contender.

RR's Vaibhav Suryavanshi celebrates his fifty (PTI Photo/Manvender Vashist Lav) Former India captain Kris Srikkanth has advocated for 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi's inclusion in India's 15-member squad for the upcoming Asia Cup T20, starting September 9. Srikkanth's endorsement comes as selectors prepare to finalize the squad on August 19, amid intense competition for spots, particularly in the opening positions.Vaibhav Suryavanshi has emerged as a strong contender following his performance in IPL 2025, where he scored 252 runs in seven matches for Rajasthan Royals at a strike rate exceeding 200. He also claimed the second-fastest century in IPL history, reaching the milestone in 35 deliveries against Gujarat Titans.Everything is special about Vaibhav Suryavanshi: Vikram RathourGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!The young prodigy continued his impressive form during the U19 tour of England, scoring a century and delivering strong performances in both one-day and four-day formats."You have to play bold. Don't make him wait. Don't say things like 'let him mature'. He is already playing with remarkable maturity. His shot-making has been on another level. If I were chairman, I would definitely have him in the squad," Srikkanth stated on his YouTube show.The selection discussion involves several established players, including Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson, who have secured their positions with an aggressive approach under coach Gautam Gambhir. Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill and current IPL Orange Cap holder Sai Sudharsan are also in contention.Srikkanth expressed uncertainty about Sanju Samson's inclusion in the squad and outlined his preferred opening combinations."Samson is doubtful, according to me," Srikkanth said. "My first-choice opener is Abhishek Sharma, no doubt. I will have two more openers. My picks would be Vaibhav Suryavanshi or Sai Sudharsan, with Shubman Gill as an option. If I were a selector, I would keep Vaibhav in the 15 for the T20 World Cup. He has been outstanding."PollShould Vaibhav Suryavanshi be included in India's squad for the Asia Cup T20?Yes, absolutely!No, he should wait."I think it should be Yashasvi Jaiswal, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, and Sai Sudharsan. I would take two out of these three. That would be my preference," he added.Since the T20 World Cup final in June 2024, Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson have been India's leading run-scorers in T20 internationals. Both players have received support from the team management, including head coach Gambhir and captain Suryakumar Yadav, for their aggressive batting style.Abhishek has accumulated 535 runs at an average of 33.43 with a strike rate of 193.84, including two centuries during this period. Samson has scored three hundreds in 17 matches at a strike rate of 171.47.However, Samson's recent performance in the five-match series against England has raised concerns. He struggled against short-pitched bowling and recorded three single-digit scores in five innings.Srikkanth, who previously captained a 16-year-old Sachin Tendulkar during his debut in Pakistan in 1989, believes India should not delay incorporating Vaibhav into the national setup as they prepare for next year's T20 World Cup.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

SUBSCRIBE NOW!"If the medical team advises, if the doctor tells me that I have to take antibiotics, then I have to consume them," Sharma said in "The Great Indian Cricket Show" on Doordarshan. "If our physios are telling a player to manage workload, I think we should listen to them because they are the better judges."The comments were made at an event where Prasar Bharati, the country's public service broadcaster, signed a deal with London-based cricket analytics company.Sharma, who had a successful bowling partnership with Kapil Dev and claimed over 125 wickets in Tests and ODIs, expressed confidence in India's chances at the upcoming Asia Cup in the UAE."I know that whoever is selected will be the best for the country. And the kind of cricket we are playing right now, I'm really proud with the way India played in England," he added."And I'm very confident that we are definitely going to win the Asia Cup (to be played in T20 format) because soon after that we are playing the T20 World Cup (in 2026) in India."It's a very big thing when you are playing (the World Cup) in you own backyard. If the intent is right, the results will also be good."The event was attended by notable cricket personalities including Madan Lal from the 1983 World Cup-winning team, former India players Murali Kartik and Aakash Chopra, along with Prasar Bharati Chairman Navneet Kumar Sehgal.When asked about including Test captain Shubman Gill, who scored four centuries in the drawn England series, in the Asia Cup squad under Suryakumar Yadav's leadership, Sharma emphasised the need for selecting the best possible team. "Look, that is up to the selectors what they see. My opinion does not matter because I am no longer the chairman (of selectors), so I will only say that the best possible team should be selected," he stated."We have such good cricketers that not just the top-15 but even if the top-30 are selected, they are all very good. Really proud of them."Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
