Joshi deemed the government's actions as unconstitutional and an attack on democracy. The film, directed by Vivek Agnihotri, explores the 1946 Great Calcutta killings and stars Anupam Kher and Mithun Chakraborty.  Actress Pallavi Joshi has criticised the West Bengal administration after the trailer launch of ‘The Bengal Files’ was allegedly stopped in Kolkata last week. Joshi, who stars in the movie, called the government’s actions “unconstitutional” and dubbed the halt an 'attack on democracy'.On August 16, 2025, the film's director, Vivek Agnihotri claimed that the trailer launch was stopped at a five-star hotel in Kolkata. NDTV later reported that Kolkata Police said the director had not sought administrative permission for a public trailer viewing. Videos of police entering the venue quickly went viral on social media.Anupam Kher Praises Pallavi Joshi; Actress Stuns In ‘Tanvi The Great’ First LookPallavi reactsAs reported by India Today, Pallavi spoke at the trailer launch in New Delhi on Monday and said, "Since the story is rooted in Bengal, we felt it would be most appropriate to launch the trailer in Bengal in August, but the government silenced us. We feel it is an act which is not only arbitrary but also unconstitutional."She added, "What happened that day was not merely an assault on the film, but an assault on democracy itself. The voices of people and the voice of Bharat were suppressed and censored. The absence of dignity and the absence of the value of human life are the themes of our film. The government proved our theme is correct."Trailer launch halted on “laughable grounds”Joshi also expressed frustration at the reason given for stopping the event, was on "very laughable grounds." She went on to add, "They said we didn't have municipal permission...The videos are about the chaos that followed. Many women journalists got hurt. I was also very uncomfortable. Thanks to Vivek, we managed to get out. We feel the police and the government are forgetting their basic duty, i.e, protecting its citizens, especially women, and their modesty. That should have been the sole priority of women."About ‘The Bengal Files’‘The Bengal Files’ is based on the 1946 Great Calcutta killings, a tragic historical episode during the final years of British colonial rule. The film stars Anupam Kher, Mithun Chakraborty, Saswata Chatterjee, and Pallavi Joshi. Directed by Vivek Agnihotri, the film is set to release on September 5, 2025."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
