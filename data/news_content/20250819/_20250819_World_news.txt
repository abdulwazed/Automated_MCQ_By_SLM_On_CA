Why do air disasters keep happening in African skies?
Recent fatal crashes in Africa have spotlighted critical issues within the continent's aviation sector, including pilot training, regulatory enforcement, and maintenance standards. Experts attribute these incidents to human error, systemic negligence, and increasingly unpredictable weather patterns exacerbated by climate change. Calls are growing for stricter adherence to international standards and improved government oversight to enhance safety and restore public trust.

Experts attribute these incidents to human error, systemic negligence, and increasingly unpredictable weather patterns exacerbated by climate change. Calls are growing for stricter adherence to international standards and improved government oversight to enhance safety and restore public trust. ANI file photo  In recent months, Africa's skies have been under intense scrutiny as a series of fatal crashes have raised questions over pilot training, regulatory enforcement, maintenance standards, weather preparedness and other key issues pertaining to the safety of the continent's aviation industry.On August 6, a Harbin Z-9EH military helicopter used by Ghana's air force slammed into a forested mountainside in the southern Ashanti Region, killing all eight passengers, including Defence Minister Edward Omane Boamah, Environment and Science Minister Ibrahim Murtala Muhammed as well as other senior political and security figures.Just one day later, this tragedy was overshadowed by another crash, when a Cessna air ambulance operated by AMREF Flying Doctors in Kenya crashed into a residential area near the capital Nairobi shortly after takeoff, claiming six lives — four on board and two on the ground.In January, a chartered Beechcraft 1900D carrying oil workers from South Sudan's Unity State to the capital Juba went down just minutes after departure from the GPOC Unity Airstrip in Rubkona County, killing all 21 on board.In June 2024, Malawi lost Vice-President Saulos Chilima and former First Lady Patricia Shanil Muluzi to another fatal crash when a Malawi Defence Force Dornier 228 plane plunged into the Chikangawa Forest Reserve en route to the city of Mzuzu, causing nine fatalities.Growing reports of severe turbulence incidents, which have left multiple passengers injured during civilian flights, have also intensified the attention towards African aviation.Human error — and hubrisIndustry experts say the machines themselves are not the problem, stressing that human error, systemic negligence, an insufficient safety culture, and increasingly unpredictable weather patterns are the factors that, over time, have resulted in this worrying track record."Airplanes are faithful machines. They are built to serve. They are built so well that [they're] loaded with a lot of redundant components in such a way that before anything goes wrong, the airplane faithfully tells the pilots and the engineers at every point in time," Nigerian aviation consultant Godwin Ike told DW, highlighting the abundance of backup systems in modern planes and helicopters.In his view, aircraft will typically only "fall out of the skies because human operators can be very unfaithful and more often than not, horribly dishonest."According to Ike, there's a certain element of human pride that can still get in the way of otherwise perfectly operational aircraft. Ike insists that taking simple actions like refusing take-off when automated systems detect a fault can make all the difference between life and death, adding that adhering to regular maintenance schedules are also just as important."Turn that plane in for maintenance that is due. In that way, you can be guaranteed usage without any issues," he said, adding this is not a form of weakness but safety in action.Mind the weatherFor Felicity Ahafianyo, the head of Ghana's Central Analysis and Forecast Office, the greater danger is less about preparedness and reaction on the ground but rather in the skies. She warns that climate change has affected weather patterns in the higher levels of the atmosphere across the globe, making certain hazards less predictable."When it comes to aviation industry, weather is a key factor. The first part has to do with the convective activities. That's the formation of thunderstorm clouds. Another one has to do with visibility. Another one has to do with the wind shear. Some areas are getting more rainfall more than usual," she said."Apart from the convective activities that affect the aircraft operations, there is clear weather turbulence or clear air turbulence, which also affects aircraft operations."Ahafianyo's team provides helicopters with various, crucial information for the safe and proper operation of aircraft. This includes "the vertical profile of the atmosphere from flight level 600 up to 12,000 feet high in the sky, the tropical boundary locations for the day," and "if there could be any shears that may disturb their operations."But not every pilot listens, she says: "I was once an aviation forecaster, and could see that some pilots don't care about the weather." When faced with persistent weather problems, Ike argued, pilots should head to "the nearest airport, and announce that they want to do an emergency landing."However, he added that sometimes pilots decided to follow this standard protocol too late — especially when transporting government ministers and other influential leaders, whose time may appear to be too precious for an emergency landing and interruption of the trip.Africa's negligence of international standardsThe two analysts highlighted that the recent crashes also exposed deeper political and regulatory failings.Weak government oversight, an inconsistent safety culture, and growing economic pressures from rising fuel prices as well as the high cost of obtaining spare parts all combined to create ever growing risks.Ike also said that while the issue of human error in the cockpit must be addressed, the problem of human negligence on the ground might be even greater.Until Africa's aviation industry caught up to the highest air traffic standards, he said, pilots must be told to treat every mechanical alert and each weather warning as an instruction, not a suggestion.International aviation bodies meanwhile have also repeatedly urged African governments to strengthen the enforcement of their safety standards and to better adapt to growing climate volatility, as each crash further erodes public trust.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousTaarak Mehta’s Sunayana Fozdar’s top 10 ethnic lookstv'Coolie' actress Rachita Ram's most gorgeous picturesEntertainmentPreity Mukhundhan radiates eleganceEntertainmentNeha Harsora’s dazzling and dreamy ethnic lookstvBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning weekend looks of the contestantstvFun facts about the Param Sundari actor Sidharth MalhotraEntertainment8 simple habits that will help reduce stress on the eyes and improve vision naturallyLifestyle8 times Samantha Ruth Prabhu turned perfect muse for Krésha BajajLifestyleSaree tales by actress Nisha RavikrishnantvManasi Parekh Serves Style & SmilesEntertainment Next123 Photostories  When Bollywood dared to break silence on social injusticeFrom 68.5 to 55 kg in Just 45 Days: Sunita Gogoi shares the discipline behind her 13 kg weight loss journeySmiles replace tensions as Zelenskyy visits Trump: EU, Nato leaders rally at White House - photos10 lesser known health benefits of eating cardamomWhy Ganga aarti is performed every evening: Understanding its spiritual significanceHow to make Chia Seed and Coconut Oil hair mask for quick hair growthBrown bread vs multigrain bread vs white bread, which is worse?Power passports: Citizens of these 5 countries can enter 185+ nations visa-free or on arrivalHow to build a timeless wardrobe inspired by Meryl StreepMovies that capture the strength of smiling through pain123Hot PicksCP RadhakrishnanMumbai RainsHurricane Erin 2025Brooklyn Nightclub ShootingMarco RubioCrimeaBank Holidays AugustTop TrendingPatrick MahomesAntonio BrownRaheem MorrisJoy TaylorTravis Hunters WifeOlivia Paige DunneMartina NavratilovaMarco BelinelliPatrick MahomesTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire Website‘Not a great day’: Donald Trump displays artwork of Butler attack to European leaders - videoUS crackdown on foreign students: Over 6,000 visas revoked this year;

According to a department official, the visas were revoked because individuals either overstayed their permits or violated US laws. The “vast majority” of the legal violations involved assault, driving under the influence, burglary, and “support for terrorism.” Of the more than 6,000 revocations, about 4,000 were linked to criminal offenses. Secretary of state Marco Rubio said in an interview with EWTN in early August that a student visa is not a constitutional right.“There is no constitutional right to a student visa. A student visa is something we decide to give you. Visas of every kind are denied every day all over the world. As I speak to you now, someone’s visa application to the US is being denied. So, if I would have denied you a visa had I known something about you, and I find out afterwards that I gave you a visa and I found this out about you, why wouldn’t I be able to revoke your visa?”Between 200 and 300 visas were canceled over alleged terrorism under provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that bar foreign nationals from entry due to “terrorist related activities”, CNN reported. The revocations came as the Trump administration escalated its scrutiny of universities and student visa programs. Officials particularly focused on international students participating in protests against the war in Gaza, accusing them of antisemitism and supporting terrorism. In one high-profile case, Tufts University PhD student Rumeysa Ozturk’s visa was canceled. She was detained by masked federal agents in March and placed in ICE custody, before a judge ordered her release in May. In June, the State Department instructed embassies and consulates to more closely vet student visa applicants for “hostile attitudes towards our citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles.” Applicants were asked to make their social media profiles public as part of the process.  According to the State Department, roughly 400,000 F1 student visas were issued in fiscal year 2024.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

CSIS had posted on its official X handle “Back in June, CSIS launched its #PrideSeason celebrations with a few guest speakers. Thanks to the talented Two-spirit hoop dancer Makhena Ranken Guerin, the hilarious Canadian comedienne Ava Val, and inspirational public servant David Da Silva...”The post quickly sparked an outpouring of critical remarks online. Some commentators seized on the juxtaposition of a national security agency engaging in Pride celebrations, ridiculing the blend of intelligence work with performative inclusivity. Some social-media users mockingly reacted that CSIS had “gone full rainbow”. Others said such initiatives risked trivializing the gravity of national security concerns.Observers noted that the intelligence agency had been increasingly active on social media platforms, engaging publicly and actively sharing cultural moments.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The moment was captured on video, which circulated widely on social media, and quickly garnered views with many users reacting to the gesture. While some described it as the “Modi effect,” others highlighted the growing camaraderie between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Italian leader. This was not the first time Meloni used the gesture. Earlier, at the G7 Summit in Italy, she was also seen welcoming world leaders with a “namaste.” Her interactions with PM Modi have repeatedly sparked conversations online on several occasions. The Italian prime minister was in Washington on the invitation of US President Donald Trump for a multilateral meeting. Other attendees included European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine amidst the Russia-Ukraine war. At the meeting, Meloni thanked Trump while noting Russia’s willingness to discuss ways to end the conflict. “I think it is an important day, a new phase, after three years ... [when] we didn't see any kind of sign from the Russian side, that there [is] a willingness for dialogue,” she said. “So something is changing. Something has changed.”Read | 'Putin wants to make a deal for me': Donald Trump heard whispering to Emmanuel Macron; reveals Russia’s ceasefire intentionAbout the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Donald Trump and Ursula von der Leyen discussed the global problem of missing children, emphasizing reunification efforts. Melania Trump's letter urged Putin to protect Ukrainian children and restore their laughter. ANI file photo  Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday expressed his gratitude to US First Lady Melania Trump for penning a “peace letter” to Russian president Vladimir Putin, addressing the abduction of Ukrainian children.Zelenskyy said the abductions highlighted one of the most “painful and difficult issues” of the conflict and reaffirmed his commitment to pursuing an “all-for-all” exchange of prisoners of war.“I want to thank @FLOTUS Melania Trump for her attention to one of the most painful and difficult issues of this war, the abduction of Ukrainian children by Russia. We deeply appreciate her compassion and her letter to Putin,” Zelenskyy said through a post on X.‘This issue lies at the heart of the war’s humanitarian tragedy, our children, broken families, the pain of separation. At least 20,000 children were taken,” Zelenskyy said. He added that he gave US president Donald Trump a letter from Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, to be passed on to Melania Trump.“Her (Melania's) voice matters, and her care gives strength to this cause,” Zelenskyy added.The Ukrainian president said the government continued efforts to secure the return of children, as well as prisoners of war and civilians held in Russia. Some of those detainees, he noted, have been imprisoned since 2014.“Thousands of people still need to be freed – and this is a part of making peace. We will work to negotiate all-for-all prisoners of war exchange, and we are grateful to have strong friends who help,” Zelenskyy said.Zelenskyy’s comments came after Trump said on Tuesday that he and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen discussed the “massive worldwide problem of missing children.” Trump described the issue as a priority and said efforts would be made to reunite children with their families."Ursula von der Leyen, the distinguished and highly respected president of the European Commission, and I have been discussing the massive worldwide problem of missing children. This is, likewise, a big subject with my wife, Melania. It is a subject at the top of all lists, and the world will work together to solve it, hopefully bringing them home to their families!" Trump said through a post on Truth Social.Melania Trump penned a letter on August 15 addressed to Putin and urged him to act to protect Ukrainian children, saying he could restore their laughter and safeguard their innocence."Such a bold idea transcends all human division, and you, Mr Putin, are fit to implement this vision with a stroke of the pen today," the letter read. "It is time."Zelenskyy’s talks with the US president came shortly after Trump met Putin over the weekend. European leaders also gathered in Washington to express solidarity with Ukraine and press to bolster security guarantees in any post-war framework.Participants included Trump, Zelenskyy, UK prime minister Keir Starmer, French president Emmanuel Macron, Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni, German chancellor Friedrich Merz, Finnish president Alexander Stubb, Nato secretary general Mark Rutte, and Ursula von der Leyen.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Trump hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and seven European leaders, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, Nato secretary general Mark Rutte, and European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen. During the meeting, a hot mic inadvertently caught audio of Trump whispering to Emmanuel Macron during the meeting.“I think he [Russian President Vladimir Putin] wants to make a deal,” Trump said. “I think he wants to make a deal for me, you understand that? As crazy as it sounds,” the New York Post reported.The remark suggested that Trump believed Putin was inclined to strike an agreement, offering further insight into his assessment of his recent talks with the Russian leader. Trump had met Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday. Both leaders described the meeting in positive terms, but no formal agreement or signed deal was announced. Trump stated, “We had an extremely productive meeting, and many points were agreed to,” while adding, “We didn’t get there.” Addressing reporters, he remarked, “There’s no deal until there’s a deal.” Trump and special presidential envoy Steve Witkoff, who also participated in the Alaska summit, claimed that they had secured Putin’s agreement to allow US and other NATO forces to come to Ukraine’s defense should Moscow violate any terms of a potential peace arrangement. Following Monday’s consultations with Zelenskyy and European leaders, Trump said he called Putin to begin preparing a direct meeting between the two warring sides, which would be followed by a trilateral session including the US president.

Alexander Stubb: Finnish President Alexander Stubb praised US President Donald Trump for the progress made in talks to resolve Russia’s war in Ukraine. “I think in the past two weeks, we’ve probably had more progress in ending this war than we have in the past three and a half years,” he said today, pointing to the symbolic nature of the leaders gathering to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine.Friedrich Merz: German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the path is open for more serious negotiations to be held on the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. “I can’t imagine that the next meeting will take place without a ceasefire,” he said. “So let’s work on that.”Mark Rutte: “The fact that you have said ‘I am willing to participate in the security guarantees’ is a big step, it’s really a breakthrough, and it makes all the difference. So also thank you for that,” Nato secretary general Mark Rutte said to Trump. Emmanuel Macron: French president Emmanuel Macron said a European leader should be at the table when Trump, Zelenskyy, Putin sit for the next meeting. “I think as a follow up, we would need probably a quadrilateral meeting. Because when we speak about security guarantees, we speak about the whole security of the European continent,” he said.Giorgia Meloni: Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni thanks Trump for Russia's willingness to talk about ending the war. "I think it is an important day, a new phase, after three years ... [when] we didn't see any kind of sign from the Russian side, that there [is] a willingness for dialogue," she said.

Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem said the death of three people in Florida caused by a semi truck's wrong U-turn was a gut-wrenching tragedy which should have never happened. Noem said DHS will work with the US Department of Transportation to ensure that illegal aliens do not get licenses from sanctuary jurisdictions. "3 innocent people were killed in Florida because Gavin Newsom’s California DMV issued an illegal alien a Commercial Driver’s License. This gut wrenching tragedy should have never happened," Noem posted."Three innocent people were killed in Florida because Gavin Newsom’s California DMV issued an illegal alien a Commercial Driver’s License—this state of governance is asinine," DHS said in a statement."How many more innocent people have to die before Gavin Newsom stops playing games with the safety of the American public? We pray for the victims and their families. Secretary Noem and DHS are working around the clock to protect the public and get these criminal illegal aliens out of America," the statement added.Florida accident: Why DHS fighting with California Harjinder Singh, the driver of the semi that took a wrong U-turn and caused the deaths of three people who were in their vehicle, got his driving license in California. As California is Democratic ruled, the Trump administration and Governor Gavin Newsom's office started passing the buck on one another for the tragedy. While DHS blamed California for giving a driver's license to the illegal alien, Newsom's office said Singh entered the US in 2018 when Trump was the president. Did Harjinder Singh enter US illegally in 2018?DHS confirmed that Harjinder Singh entered the US illegally through the southern border in 2018 and was arrested within two days. But he said he was scared to go back to India -- a fear that was affirmed by US Citizenship and Immigration Services. At that time, he was released on a $5,000 immigration bond. His immigration proceedings remained pending since then but he managed to get a driver's license in California. California's Assembly Bill 60 (AB 60), enacted in 2015, allows undocumented immigrants to apply for a driver's license if they can provide proof of identity and California residency. These licenses are marked "not for federal identification."About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Instead of photos of Ukrainian children suffering the war that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy brought to the White House in February, this time Zelenskyy brought a letter from Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska addressed to First Lady Melania Trump and offered it to Donald Trump at the beginning of their joint sit-down Monday. This was taking a leaf out of the recent example set by Trump himself who hand-delivered Melania's letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Zelenskyy praised the gesture and then took out the letter from his wife and specified that the letter was not meant for Trump. "Thank you very much for your efforts, personal efforts to stop the killings and stop this war," Zelenskyy said, adding that Melania's letter mentioned Ukraine's children. “My wife, the first lady of Ukraine, she gave the letter. It’s not to you but to your wife,” he said"I want," Trump said in his instant reaction.What Melania wrote in her letter to Trump"In today's world, some children are forced to carry a quiet laughter, untouched by the darkness around them," Melania wrote. "Mr Putin, you can singlehandedly restore their melodic laughter," it added. "In protecting the innocence of these children, you will do more than serve Russia alone -- you serve humanity itself.""Such a bold idea transcends all human division, and you, Mr Putin, are fit to implement this vision with a stroke of the pen today," the letter read. "It is time."During Monday's press conference, Trump spoke about Melania;s letter to Putin, urging him to protect children amid the push to end his war in Ukraine, and said it was “very well received” by the Russian leader. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, alongside Zelenskyy that Melania “loves children and she hates to see something like this happening.” “She would love to see this end,” Trump said. “She says it very openly, very proudly, and with great sorrow.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Smiling, the Ukrainian leader replied, “This is the best I had.”Zelenskyy, long known for his trademark military-style attire, surprised many by turning up in a black blazer over a buttoned black shirt.The lighter moment marked a contrast from both the leader’s February meeting, which had ended in tense exchanges.Back then, Trump poked fun at Zelenskyy’s military-style outfit, joking to reporters as Zelenskyy appeared in a black sweater, “Oh look, he’s all dressed up today!”During the press conference, Zelenskyy was questioned about why he never wears a suit. The reporter asked, "You're the highest level in this country's office and you refuse to wear a suit. Just want to see if you do own a suit."Zelenskyy pushed back, asking if the reporter had a problem with his outfit, and said, "I don't have such an office. I will wear costume after this war will finish. Yes. Maybe. Maybe something like yours. Yes. Maybe something better. I don't know. We will see. Maybe something cheaper than this."That earlier meeting had ended in heated exchanges, with Vice President JD Vance accusing Zelenskyy of being ungrateful for Trump’s peace efforts. However, both leaders have since shown willingness to ease tensions.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

(AP) The strike by over 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants entered its third day on Monday, leaving hundreds of thousands of passengers stranded amid the peak summer travel season. The Canada Industrial Relations Board (CIRB) had declared the stoppage illegal and ordered workers back to their posts, but the union has refused to comply. CUPE National President Mark Hancock, speaking at a briefing on Monday, signaled the union’s determination. “There's no limit. We're going to stay strong. We're going to stay committed to making sure that those workers can do the job they love doing and actually be able to afford a roof over their heads, to afford caring for their families,” he said. “And if it means folks like me going to jail, then so be it. If it means our union being fined, then so be it. We're looking for a solution here. Our members want a solution here. But that solution has to be found at a bargaining table.” Flight attendants walked off the job early Saturday after rejecting Air Canada’s request to enter government-directed arbitration, which would allow a third party to determine contract terms. Hancock publicly tore up a copy of the initial back-to-work order outside Toronto’s Pearson International Airport, to the cheers of picketing workers. Air Canada has warned staff that those defying the order may be held personally accountable. The airline suspended plans to restart operations Sunday evening after the union refused to return to work, affecting about 130,000 passengers daily. Prime Minister Mark Carney urged both sides to resolve the dispute quickly. “We are in a situation where literally hundreds of thousands of Canadians and visitors to our country are being disrupted by this action,” he said, emphasizing the need for fair compensation and a resolution. The union is demanding wages comparable to those at Air Transat and pay for work on the ground, such as boarding passengers. Air Canada’s offer included a 38% increase in total compensation over four years, but CUPE rejected it, citing insufficient first-year raises against inflation. With no immediate sign of compromise, the standoff is expected to continue, leaving passengers uncertain and the government weighing potential legal or legislative measures to end the strike.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

After Indian-origin truck driver Harjinder Singh killed three taking a wrong turn with his semi-truck in Florida, the Donald Trump administration dug out all his previous records and it's now confirmed that he was arrested by the Border Patrol two days after he illegally entered the country through California in 2018. Harjinder Singh's immigrant proceedings are pending following his arrest on September 20, 2018, said the Department of Homeland Security.When he was arrested in 2018, he was processed for expedited removal but he claimed at that time that he was scared to return to India. Fox News reported that his fear was affirmed by US Citizenship and Immigration Services and he was released on a $5,000 immigration bond. 3 killed on Florida TurnpikeSingh was arrested after three people were killed near Fort Pierce on the Florida Turnpike on August 12. All three of them were in a minivan. Two passengers, a 37-year-old woman from Pompano Beach and a 54-year-old man from Miami, died at the scene, and the driver, a 30-year-old man from Florida City, later died in the hospital.PollDo you think stricter immigration checks could prevent incidents like this?Yes, stronger checks are neededNo, other measures are more effectiveSingh was arrested by US Marshals in California on Saturday on a warrant for three counts of vehicular homicide in connection with a deadly crash in Florida, according to Fox News. Under Florida law, vehicular homicide is a second-degree felony, punishable by up to 15 years in prison.After the video recorded inside the semi-truck went viral, Indians were attacked for driving mishaps on US roads and after Singh was found to be an illegal alien from India, the incident became a major political flashpoint. DHS said Singh stated that he does not have a serious physical or mental medical condition, has "no known immediate relatives serving in the US military and is not the primary caretaker of a person with mental or physical disability, a minor or person with a serious illness." Singh is also unmarried, has no minor dependent children and is not a victim of domestic violence or human trafficking -- factors that could have stopped his immediate deportation. "After careful consideration of all factors and available records, Singh is considered a significant threat to public safety and is an exceptional circumstance warranting enforcement action due to the serious nature of his criminal history," DHS said.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

'If you are trying to brain-drain Bangalore...': US economist's H-1B explanation goes viral

American economist Peter St Onge's video explaining the H-1B system and what changes the Donald Trump administration is trying to bring is has gone viral as he summarized that the H-1B overhaul that Trump is planning will restore the visa program to what it was meant for and not brain-draining India's Bangalore to run IT sweatshop in the US, depriving American workers. "Will Americans who did learn to code get jobs?" the economist asked as the administration is planning to switch to a wage-based H-1B hiring which means companies will be allowed to hire only high-wage top talents from foreign countries. "JD Vance blasted companies that laid off Americans and then replaced them at half the price with H-1Bs. The administration now plans to return the program to its original purpose of bringing in top talent rather than running coding sweatshops that replace Americans," the economist said. "The background is H-1B was introduced in 1990 to bring top talent in engineering technology and medicine. The original salary cut-off was $60,000 which in 1990 was about twice the salary of an entry-level programmer. In other words, top talent.""The problem is it was never adjusted for inflation and $60K is now below an entry-level programmer. If it were adjusted for inflation, the minimum H-1B today would be $139,000. So what was originally supposed to be the best and brightest in the world is now a giant sweatshop. And giant it is. The initial H-1B cap was just 65,000 workers a year that grew to 85, then they added an unlimited exemption for universities, non-profits and government. Given each H-1B is a six-year visa and extendable, not 65,000, it's not 85,000, it's 730,000 H-1Bs, which is about one in 8 tech jobs," Onge broke it down. "It gets worse because after a few years as H-1Bs can be converted into green cards, who get to stay permanently. By one estimate, that's another 1.5 to 2 million H-1Bs, plus in dependents educated with your tax dollars, and we are talking roughly 3 million people on the H-1b gravy train, including roughly a million and a half tech workers, which is about one quarter of all tech jobs.""Now it's one thing if the workers were making $139 or $190, that's top talent who build companies and create jobs but at 60,000 is a different story. At that level, they are replacing entry-level American tech workers who never got the chance to upskill, build companies and create jobs."Onge said the cleanest fix would be simply to adjust for inflation, so instead of 60 it's 139,000, as what Elon and Vivek were proposing earlier this year, along with an annual fee to ensure H-1Bs are only used for top talent. "Now Trump is planning something more aggressive, converting the program to a kind of reverse auction where the highest wages get the slots. So if you are hiring a rockstar German AI programmer for half a million, it's automatic as it should be. If you're trying to brain drain Bangalore, it is a no," the economist said.

The US embassy in India issued a fresh warning to Indians against overstaying in the US and explained the difference between the 'Admit until date' and the expiry of the visa date. "Your authorized period of stay is the 'Admit Until Date' on your I-94, not your U.S. visa expiration date. Staying in the United States beyond your authorized date is called an “overstay” and could result in a visa revocation, possible deportation, and ineligibility for future visas," the embassy said.What is 'admit until date'?It is the date mentioned on I-94 (arrival/departure record) which is issued by the US Customs and Border Protection. It is not written on the visa. If you entered the US on a visa with a fixed duration (like B-1/B-2 visitor visas, F-1 students, or H-1B workers), the admit until date will usually be a specific calendar date. You must either leave the US, extend your stay, or change status on or before that date to remain in lawful status.In some cases (like many F-1 student visas or J-1 exchange visitors), the I-94 may say “D/S” (Duration of Status) instead of a date. That means you are admitted for as long as you maintain your student or exchange status, not until a specific day.Visa expiry dateThe 'admit until date' is different from the visa expiry date, which is stamped in the passport. It is the last day one can use to visa to enter the United States. It does not control how long you can stay inside the US after you’ve already entered.If one overstays the date mentioned on the I-94 document as the 'admit until date', they are out of status even if their visa has not expired. While the visa expiry date denotes the deadline to enter the US, the 'admit until date' is the deadline to stay in the US.
