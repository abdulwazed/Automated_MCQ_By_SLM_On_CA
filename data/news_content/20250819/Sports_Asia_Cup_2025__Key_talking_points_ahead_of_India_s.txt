Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Surya secure as leader? Suryakumar Yadav, after clearing a BCCI fitness test, is set to continue as T20 captain, potentially through to the 2026 T20 World Cup.The Gill dilemma: Despite Shubman Gill’s stellar IPL-2025 (650 runs, avg 50, strike-rate 155.87 as Gujarat Titans skipper), selectors are likely to exclude him from the Asia Cup squad. The focus is likely to be on boundary-hitting prowess. Samson, Abhishek to open? Sanju Samson (three T20I hundreds last year) and Abhishek Sharma (explosive 135 vs England earlier this year) are seen as firstchoice openers. Tilak Varma at No. 3: Despite an average IPL, Varma’s two T20I hundreds in South Africa guarantee his spot, highlighting the priority of international form over IPL stats. Jaiswal as third opener? Yashasvi Jaiswal is touted to be the preferred third opener over Gill, primarily due to his hitting abilities in the Powerplay. What happens to Shreyas Iyer? Shreyas Iyer, despite a strong IPL (captaining Punjab Kings to the final) and top-scoring in the 2025 Champions Trophy (243 runs), faces stiff competition from left-handed big-hitters like Shivam Dube and Rinku Singh.Bumrah good to go: The ace pacer has confirmed his availability. Meanwhile, Mohammed Siraj has been rested. Expect Arshdeep Singh, Prasidh Krishna (IPL Purple Cap with 25 wickets) and Harshit Rana to fill the quota of fast bowlers in the squad. Spin arsenal: Varun Chakravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Washington Sundar and Axar Patel are locked in for the pitches in UAE, blending attack and allround abilities. Jitesh in the fray: Jitesh Sharma, IPL champion with RCB, is likely to get the nod as backup ’keeper due to his finishing skills.
