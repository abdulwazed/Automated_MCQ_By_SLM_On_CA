Ashwin Kumar's mythological epic, 'Mahavatar Narsimha,' has become a box office success, grossing ₹161.1 crore in 25 days. It's now the sixth highest-grossing Hindi film of 2025 and may surpass Aamir Khan's 'Sitaare Zameen Par.' Despite facing competition, the film's strong performance, driven by positive word-of-mouth and cultural resonance, highlights the power of content-driven storytelling in Bollywood. Ashwin Kumar’s mythological epic Mahavatar Narsimha has scripted a remarkable success story at the Hindi box office. After a steady 25-day run, the film has collected Rs 161.1 crore net, officially making it the sixth highest-grossing Hindi film of 2025 so far. What’s more, with Aamir Khan’s Sitaare Zameen Par standing just ahead at Rs 166.18 crore, trade believes Mahavatar Narsimha could well challenge for the fifth spot by the coming weekend as the animation film was able to survive the clash between Rajinikanth’s Coolie and Hrithik Roshan-Jr NTR’s War 2 and both films are now losing audience with each passing day.The year 2025 has been crowded with big-ticket Hindi releases, ranging from historical dramas to comedies and sequels. The top five at the moment include Chhaava (Rs 585.7 crore), Saiyaara (Rs 324.67 crore), Housefull 5 (Rs 183.88 crore), Raid 2 (Rs 173.44 crore), and Sitaare Zameen Par (Rs 166.18 crore). For Mahavatar Narsimha a film without an A-list star headlining it breaking into this list is a feat in itself.The film opened modestly with Rs 1.35 crore on Day 1in Hindi, but its collections grew quickly as positive word-of-mouth spread and it ended week 1 on Rs 32.45 crore. By Week 2 the film added another Rs 54.95 crore to its kitty. During Week 3 the collections remained steady as it added another Rs 53.75 crore to its tally and during the fourth weekend it minted Rs 18.45 crore. On Monday the film earned another Rs 1.5 crore, taking the overall Hindi collection of the film to Rs 161.1 crore as per Sacnilk, while the overall collection of the film stands at Rs 212.6 crore Such box office stamina indicates that the film has connected deeply with audiences, particularly in the Hindi heartland, where mythological stories continue to hold immense cultural resonance.At its current total of Rs 161.1 crore, Mahavatar Narsimha is just Rs 5 crore short of overtaking Sitaare Zameen Par. Given its present trend of Rs 1-2 crore weekday earnings and higher weekend jumps, trade believes the crossover could happen within the next few days. If that occurs, Ashwin Kumar’s directorial will climb to the 5th position among 2025’s Hindi blockbusters, displacing an Aamir Khan starrer, no small achievement for a film led by content rather than sheer star power.The film’s success can be attributed to multiple factors. The mythological theme, blending spirituality with cinematic spectacle, has resonated with family audiences. With Rs 161.1 crore already in its kitty, Mahavatar Narsimha has not just surprised trade pundits but also cemented Ashwin Kumar’s place as a filmmaker to watch. The coming weekend will be crucial—if the film overtakes Sitaare Zameen Par, it will rewrite the rankings yet again and prove that content-driven storytelling still has the power to challenge Bollywood’s biggest stars at the box office."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
