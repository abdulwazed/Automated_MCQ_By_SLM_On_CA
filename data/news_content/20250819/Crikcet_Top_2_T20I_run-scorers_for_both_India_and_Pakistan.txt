For India, Rohit Sharma (4,231 runs) and Virat Kohli (4,188 runs) have already retired from T20 internationals, while Pakistan’s selectors made the bold call to omit Babar Azam (4,223 runs) and Mohammad Rizwan (3,414 runs) from their 17-member squad announced on Sunday.Pakistan, led by Salman Ali Agha, will play a preparatory tri-series against Afghanistan and UAE in Sharjah from August 29 to September 7 before the Asia Cup begins in the Emirates on September 9. The team management’s decision to leave out two of Pakistan’s most successful modern-day batters has sparked major debate, given that Babar and Rizwan were central to Pakistan’s famous 10-wicket win over India in the 2021 T20 World Cup.
