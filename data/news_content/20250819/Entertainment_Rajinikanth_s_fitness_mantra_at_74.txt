A viral gym video showcases his dedication to fitness through disciplined workouts. Beyond physical exercise, he emphasizes yoga, meditation, and a clean vegetarian diet for overall well-being. His latest film, ‘Coolie,’ released on August 14th, has already grossed over Rs.  Rajinikanth, often called one of the greatest icons of Indian cinema, has ruled the silver screen for nearly fifty years. With a career packed with blockbuster hits and an unmatched fan base, his charm and energy continue to inspire people across the world. Even at seventy-four, the superstar of ‘Coolie’ and ‘Jailer’ shows no signs of slowing down. Instead, he is proving every day that age is no barrier to fitness, health and success.Viral gym videoRecently, a short clip of Rajinikanth exercising in a gym went viral on social media. Fans were thrilled to see the actor working out with the same discipline that made him a star. In the video, he begins with an incline dumbbell press, building strength in his upper body. He then moves to squats with the help of a bench, targeting his legs and core. To finish, he flexes his biceps while his trainer stands proudly beside him. The video was shared widely, with fans praising his determination and showing how fitness is a lifelong commitment.The power of Yoga, Meditation and KriyaWhile gym workouts are important, Rajinikanth also gives equal importance to inner strength. Yoga and breathing exercises have been part of his daily routine for years, reported The Health Site. In an interview cited by Telugu movie entertainment website Cinejosh, he has often credited more than 20 years of Kriya Yoga practice for giving him energy, focus and inner calm. This discipline, he believes, is the real reason behind his ability to remain positive and balanced even with the pressures of stardom.A simple and clean vegetarian dietRajinikanth made a big change in his lifestyle in 2014 when he adopted vegetarianism for health reasons. Since then, his meals are fresh, simple and home-cooked. As reported by Business Standard, he prefers fruits, vegetables, grains and nuts, while cutting out processed foods, sugar, fast food and refined dairy products. This clean diet not only keeps his body fit but also gives him the energy he needs to perform with such vigour on screen.Rest, recovery and time in natureAnother secret to his energy is proper rest and recovery. Sleep is non-negotiable for Rajinikanth. After completing each film, he takes time off to recharge and visits the Himalayas, where he finds both peace and strength in the lap of nature. These trips are not just about physical rest but also about spiritual healing, which helps him return to work with renewed energy.Discipline over quick fixesUnlike many who look for shortcuts, Rajinikanth’s fitness is built on years of discipline. He combines structured workouts, meditation, clean eating and rest in a way that balances both body and mind. His lifestyle shows that real strength comes from consistency, mindfulness and a deep spiritual connection. This is why he remains a wellness icon for fans across all age groups.‘Coolie’ roars at the Box OfficeEven as he maintains his health, Rajinikanth continues to deliver massive hits. His latest film ‘Coolie’, released on 14 August, turned theatres into a festival. The film created huge excitement from the start and lived up to expectations with a strong opening. Despite clashing with the big Bollywood spy thriller ‘War 2’, starring Hrithik Roshan, Jr NTR and Kiara Advani, ‘Coolie’ stormed ahead from day one. According to Sacnilk, the film collected over Rs. 206 crores in just five days, proving once again that Rajinikanth’s magic at the box office is as powerful as ever."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
