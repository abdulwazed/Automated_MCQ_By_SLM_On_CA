In several cases, it proposes to introduce "improvement notices" for first-time violations, replacing fines with penalties and giving violators an opportunity to rectify their non-compliance.Introducing the bill, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said it seeks to enhance trust-based governance for ease of doing business. The bill was referred to the select committee of LS for scrutiny, which is to submit its report by the first day of the next session of Parliament.The Bill seeks to simplify 355 provisions - decriminalising 288 provisions and amending 67. It uses the term "contraventions" instead of "offence" to give an opportunity to violators to mend their ways. It proposes to rationalise penalties for repeat violations.PollShould imprisonment be removed for minor offences according to the new bill?Yes, it makes sense.No, it should remain.Officials said the bill reflects a shift from the earlier approach of "penalise on first detection" to a "warning-correct-penalise" model, which would promote voluntary compliance. For deterrence, a steep hike in penalties has been proposed for second and subsequent violations in several cases.For example, in the Central Silk Board Act, 1948, the bill proposes to replace the provision of imprisonment of up to one year and up to Rs 1,000 fine to "warning" for first contravention while for subsequent violations the proposed penalty has been hiked manifold (Rs 25,000-1 lakh) for furnishing any false statement. Similarly, the proposed penalty for manufacturing and sale of Ayurvedic, Siddha or Unani drugs in contravention to the provision of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act is three times more. As per the bill, the provision of up to six months' jail and fine of at least Rs 10,000 would be replaced with only fine of at least Rs 30,000.The bill proposes to amend provisions related to sectors such as agriculture export, industries, transport, electricity, municipal services, textile and coir. It states that the fear of imprisonment for minor offences is a "major factor" hampering the business ecosystem and individual confidence.The legislation proposes to amend 20 provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act to provide relaxation and clarity in compliance, including statewide vehicle registration instead of jurisdiction-specific; driving licence (DL) renewal effective from date of renewal if applied after expiry; 30 days grace period after licence expiry; reporting period for vehicle registration cancellation extended to 30 days from 14; and insurer intimation period on transfer of insurance certificate extended to 30 days from 14.However, for stricter action against air-pollution, the bill proposes Rs 10,000 fine and disqualification to hold DL for first offence while jail and penalty for subsequent offence. This proposes to set a 12-month timeline for claims tribunals to dispose of accident related cases.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousTaarak Mehta’s Sunayana Fozdar’s top 10 ethnic lookstv'Coolie' actress Rachita Ram's most gorgeous picturesEntertainmentPreity Mukhundhan radiates eleganceEntertainmentNeha Harsora’s dazzling and dreamy ethnic lookstvBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning weekend looks of the contestantstvFun facts about the Param Sundari actor Sidharth MalhotraEntertainment8 simple habits that will help reduce stress on the eyes and improve vision naturallyLifestyle8 times Samantha Ruth Prabhu turned perfect muse for Krésha BajajLifestyleSaree tales by actress Nisha RavikrishnantvManasi Parekh Serves Style & SmilesEntertainment Next123 Photostories  When Bollywood dared to break silence on social injusticeFrom 68.5 to 55 kg in Just 45 Days: Sunita Gogoi shares the discipline behind her 13 kg weight loss journeySmiles replace tensions as Zelenskyy visits Trump: EU, Nato leaders rally at White House - photos10 lesser known health benefits of eating cardamomWhy Ganga aarti is performed every evening: Understanding its spiritual significanceHow to make Chia Seed and Coconut Oil hair mask for quick hair growthBrown bread vs multigrain bread vs white bread, which is worse?Power passports: Citizens of these 5 countries can enter 185+ nations visa-free or on arrivalHow to build a timeless wardrobe inspired by Meryl StreepMovies that capture the strength of smiling through pain123Hot PicksCP RadhakrishnanMumbai RainsHurricane Erin 2025Brooklyn Nightclub ShootingMarco RubioCrimeaBank Holidays AugustTop TrendingPatrick MahomesAntonio BrownRaheem MorrisJoy TaylorTravis Hunters WifeOlivia Paige DunneMartina NavratilovaMarco BelinelliPatrick MahomesTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteINDIA bloc continues SIR protest: Telangana Congress demands urea for farmers; ruckus adjourns parliamentHow 'India’s secrets' helped Shubhanshu Shukla in space: Astronaut shares experience with PM Modi - WatchWhy should one pay to spend 12 hours in traffic jams?
