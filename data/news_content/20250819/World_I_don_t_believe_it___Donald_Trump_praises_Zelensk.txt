Smiling, the Ukrainian leader replied, “This is the best I had.”Zelenskyy, long known for his trademark military-style attire, surprised many by turning up in a black blazer over a buttoned black shirt.The lighter moment marked a contrast from both the leader’s February meeting, which had ended in tense exchanges.Back then, Trump poked fun at Zelenskyy’s military-style outfit, joking to reporters as Zelenskyy appeared in a black sweater, “Oh look, he’s all dressed up today!”During the press conference, Zelenskyy was questioned about why he never wears a suit. The reporter asked, "You're the highest level in this country's office and you refuse to wear a suit. Just want to see if you do own a suit."Zelenskyy pushed back, asking if the reporter had a problem with his outfit, and said, "I don't have such an office. I will wear costume after this war will finish. Yes. Maybe. Maybe something like yours. Yes. Maybe something better. I don't know. We will see. Maybe something cheaper than this."That earlier meeting had ended in heated exchanges, with Vice President JD Vance accusing Zelenskyy of being ungrateful for Trump’s peace efforts. However, both leaders have since shown willingness to ease tensions.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
