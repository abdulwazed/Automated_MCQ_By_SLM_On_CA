The strategy, which aligns with the broader We the UAE 2031 vision, outlines a unified national framework to attract exceptional minds to the UAE’s priority sectors and foster an environment that retains them long-term.Strengthening the UAE’s global talent strategyThe Global Talent Attraction and Retention Committee was established under a Cabinet decision as a key mechanism to oversee the implementation of the UAE’s national strategy for attracting and retaining global talent. It is mandated to coordinate national efforts across government and private sector entities to build a sustainable, future-ready talent ecosystem. The committee chaired by Dr. Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, Minister of Foreign Trade and the official in charge of the talent strategy, met recently to evaluate and advance the initiatives under the second phase of the National Talent Attraction and Retention Strategy 2024-2027. It serves as a central driver of the UAE’s efforts to cultivate a globally competitive talent ecosystem. This second phase of the strategy includes a series of initiatives to be executed collaboratively across federal and local government entities as well as the private sector. Among its key goals are:  Attracting professionals in strategic economic sectors   Launching global promotional campaigns to spotlight the UAE as a hub for talent   Organizing international events focused on talent attraction and development   The committee includes representatives from a wide range of national bodies:  Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation   Ministry of Education   Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research   Ministry of Community Empowerment   Ministry of Culture   Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Ports Security   Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Center   Abu Dhabi Residents Office (Department of Economic Development – Abu Dhabi   Department of Economy and Tourism – Dubai   Emirates Scientists Council   Emirates Council for Artificial Intelligence and Digital Transactions   During the session, members shared insights on emerging trends and best practices from around the world and exchanged ideas for new projects that align with the UAE’s long-term talent goals.Key focus areas and strategic objectivesThe UAE’s talent strategy is built around four foundational axes:  Executing the national strategy to attract and retain high-value talent   Empowering the knowledge economy by ensuring a steady influx of strategic talent   Establishing the UAE as a preferred destination for global talent through sustained visibility and competitiveness   Improving the UAE’s international rankings in talent attraction and retention, especially within global competitiveness indices   The government’s aim is to establish the UAE not just as a workplace, but as a permanent base for global professionals, offering them long-term growth, inclusion, and a sense of belonging. Dr. Al Zeyoudi emphasized that this integrated ecosystem is essential to maintaining the UAE’s momentum in becoming one of the top 10 global talent destinations by 2031. He also noted the significant progress the UAE has already achieved. As per the 2024 Global Talent Competitiveness Report by the International Institute for Management Development (IMD):  The UAE ranks 17th globally and 1st in the Arab world   It climbed five places compared to 2023   It ranks 12th globally in the “Gravity Index”   It holds the 2nd position globally in the “Readiness Index”   These advancements, Dr. Al Zeyoudi said, are driven by the UAE’s forward-looking leadership and continuous strategic planning aimed at ensuring sustainable economic growth powered by human capital.Target sectors and long-term visionThe Cabinet-approved second phase of the Global Talent Attraction Strategy 2031 will focus heavily on sectors that are central to the UAE’s economic future. These include:  Technology   Renewable energy   Healthcare and biotechnology   Logistics and aviation   Advanced industries   Financial services   Food and water technology   Creative economy   At the core of this strategy is the intention to not only attract talent but to ensure that the UAE has the right talent in the right sectors, supporting innovation, diversification, and long-term sustainability. Three specific targets guide the broader Talent Attraction and Retention Strategy:  Positioning the UAE among the top 10 countries in global talent competitiveness   Ensuring talent availability across all strategic sectors   Solidifying the UAE’s reputation as an ideal place to live, work, and invest   The UAE's approach integrates policy development, talent ecosystem support, and international partnerships — building a comprehensive framework that supports both inbound investment and professional migration.Alignment with the “We the UAE 2031” visionThe committee’s work aligns directly with the “We the UAE 2031” vision, the country’s long-term strategic plan unveiled on November 22, 2022, during the UAE Government Annual Meetings. This national blueprint aims to:  Strengthen the UAE’s international standing   Achieve economic diversification   Enhance quality of life for residents   Cement the UAE’s place among the world’s top financial centres   With its core pillars, Forward Society, Forward Economy, Forward Diplomacy, and Forward Ecosystem, the vision leverages artificial intelligence, digital transformation, and strategic investments to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth. A key economic benchmark set by the plan is doubling the UAE’s GDP from AED 1.49 trillion to AED 3 trillion by 2031. Talent is central to this transformation, serving as both a catalyst and beneficiary of the UAE’s shift towards a knowledge- and innovation-based economy. The implementation of “We the UAE 2031” is supported through robust public-private partnerships and global cooperation, ensuring that the vision’s impact extends across sectors and communities.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
