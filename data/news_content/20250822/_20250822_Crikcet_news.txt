However, while Sidhu took five matches to achieve the landmark, Breetzke needed just four, underlining the scale of his achievement.EXCLUSIVE: India to boycott Pakistan in Asia Cup? Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'Breetzke had already announced himself in international cricket with a record-breaking 150 on ODI debut against New Zealand earlier this year, the highest score by any batter in their first match. He followed it up with 83 against Pakistan, 57 in the opening match of this series against Australia, and Friday’s authoritative knock of 88.Matthew Breetzke in ODIs so far150 vs NZ, Lahore83 vs PAK, Karachi57 vs AUS, Cairns88 vs AUS, MackaySidhu had scored 73 vs Australia, 75 vs New Zealand, 51 vs Australia, and 55 vs Zimbabwe to set the record in 1987. However, since he did not bat in his third match against Zimbabwe, it had taken him five ODIs to achieve the feat.Coming in at No. 4 after South Africa lost both openers cheaply to Xavier Bartlett, Breetzke steadied the innings with partnerships alongside Tony de Zorzi (38) and Tristan Stubbs (74 off 87). His innings included eight boundaries and two sixes, and though he fell just 12 runs short of a second century, his contribution was pivotal in guiding the Proteas to a competitive 277 in 49.1 overs.Australia’s Adam Zampa (3/63) and Nathan Ellis (2/46) ensured South Africa couldn’t push beyond 300, but Breetzke’s landmark will stand out as the talking point of the day. With the Proteas leading the three-match series 1-0, his record-setting innings has now placed them in a strong position to seal the contest.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

India vs Pakistan T20 game (X- Hardik Pandya) Former Indian cricketer Manoj Tiwary has expressed concerns about the upcoming India-Pakistan cricket match at the Asia Cup 2025, questioning its appropriateness in light of the recent Pahalgam terror attack and subsequent Operation Sindoor. The match scheduling has sparked debate, particularly after Indian legends recently boycotted their games against Pakistan in the World Championships of Legends due to bilateral tensions.India is set to begin their Asia Cup campaign against the UAE on September 10, followed by the highly anticipated match against Pakistan on September 14 in Dubai.

Tiwary told ANI.The Indian team for the Asia Cup 2025 was announced on Tuesday, with Suryakumar named as captain and Shubman Gill as vice-captain.

Jaiswal has been placed in the reserves alongside Washington Sundar, Riyan Parag, Prasidh Krishna, and Dhruv Jurel."Two deserving candidates, Shreyas Iyer and Yashasvi Jaiswal, have not been able to make it to the team... If you see old videos of Gautam Gambhir, he had said that Yashasvi Jaiswal is such a player that we cannot think of keeping him out of T-20. Now that he himself is the coach, there is no place for Shreyas Iyer in the team. Shreyas Iyer's performance is the best if you look at the last year... It's eye-opening that he didn't get a place in the T20... The selection process should be made live so that sports lovers know who has been selected and why..."

SUBSCRIBE NOW!The 2025 Women's World Cup matches were moved out of Bengaluru as the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) failed to secure permission for the games following the tragic events of June 4 when RCB's victory march turned tragic resulting in death of 11 fans and injuries to scores due to a stampede, despite being granted an extension in this regard by the BCCI. The DY Patil Stadium will now host five matches in the tournament, which comprise the three league matches (Bangladesh versus Sri Lanka match on Oct 20, India versus New Zealand clash on Oct 23, India versus Bangladesh match on Oct 26, the second semifinal on Oct 30 and potentially the final (provided that Pakistan don't make it to the summit clash) of the 13th edition of the Women's ODI World Cup on Nov 2. The opening match of the tournament, between hosts India and Sri Lanka, will now be held on Sept 30 in Guwahati. The rest of the schedule of the tournament remains unchanged.This will be the first-ever ICC tournament to be staged at the world-class DY Patil Stadium, which has witnessed a full house (45,000 capacity crowd) for Women's international matches in recent years-the 20022 India versus Australia T20I series being a prime example. The DY Patil Stadium had staged 11 matches of the inaugural season of the Women's Premier League in March 2023. The state of the art stadium also hosted Indian Premier League (IPL) finals in 2008 and 2010, when the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai was undergoing massive renovation.Endorsing the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai as "a genuine home for women's cricket," ICC chairman Jay Shah said, “Navi Mumbai has emerged as a genuine home for women’s cricket in recent years. The support it has received during international fixtures and the Women’s Premier League has been remarkable, creating an atmosphere that elevates the players and inspires fans. I am certain that the same energy will define the big matches of the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup as it returns to India after 12 years." “We stand at a pivotal moment in the journey of the women’s game. This World Cup has the potential to be remembered as one of those defining milestones that shaped the sport’s future, not only in India but across the cricketing world. While unforeseen circumstances required us to adjust the schedule and replace a venue, we are pleased to now have a line-up of five world-class venues that will showcase the very best of the women’s game. The stage is set, and I am confident this tournament will capture imaginations and inspire a new generation of fans,” he added.Expressing his gratitude to ICC chairman Jay Shah after being asked to host an ICC tournament for the first time in the venue's history, Vijay Patil, the owner of the DY Patil Stadium, and a former president of the Mumbai Cricket Association, told TOI on Friday,"I would like to thank Jay Shah, the chairman of the International Cricket Council, BCCI for allocating the Women's World Cup matches to the DY Patil Stadium for the first time ever. It's a great step forward for Women's cricket and a massive opportunity for fans in the region. I am truly thrilled and overwhelmed with news," The tournament dates of 30 September - 2 November remain unchanged, as do the other venues, which are the ACA Stadium (Guwahati), Holkar Stadium (Indore), ACA-VDCA Stadium (Visakhapatnam) and R. Premadasa Stadium (Colombo, Sri Lanka).The final of the tournament will be held either in Colombo or Navi Mumbai on 2 November, with the first semifinal set to be in Guwahati or Colombo on 29 October and the second semifinal in Navi Mumbai on 30 October.The ICC announcement ended days of suspense over the venue which will replace Bengaluru as the host of the upcoming Women's World Cup, which begins from Sept 30 in India and Sri Lanka. It had been reported by the media that Thiruvananthapuram too is a favourite for the displaced games, but again, Kerala experiences relentless rain at that time of the year. The only glitch is that Mumbai too experiences incessant rain till the end of Sept, but the monsoon should relent when the tournament moves to Navi Mumbai on Oct 23. Last Monday, the ICC marked the 50-day countdown to the tournament with an event in Mumbai.The uncertainty over Bengaluru matches led the ICC to delay the ticket sales for the matches of the tournament too.The Chinnaswamy Stadium was initially allotted five games of the 2025 Women's World Cup. Besides the tournament opener, the other league games originally slotted to Bengaluru were England-South Africa (on October 3), India-Bangladesh (on October 26), and then the two knockout matches. However, things became difficult, with the State Government toughening its stand towards cricket matches at the Chinnaswamy Stadium following the stampede tragedy. The Karnataka government recently did not give permission for the Maharaja Cup which had to be shifted to Mysuru.The eight competing teams for the Women's World Cup are Australia, England, South Africa, New Zealand, Bangladesh and Pakistan besides hosts India and Sri Lanka.

Taylor Swift and Kevin Pietersen (Images via AP & Screengrab/YouTube) Pop icon Taylor Swift once admitted to being baffled by cricket during an appearance on The Graham Norton Show, where she shared the couch with former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen. The exchange, which aired in 2014, resurfaced for the singer’s candid and light-heartedly hilarious remarks about the sport. At the time, Pietersen was promoting his autobiography KP: The Autobiography, which revisited the infamous “textgate” controversy of 2012. The former England batter faced pointed questions from Norton about sending provocative messages to members of the South African team during a Test series, a scandal that tainted his relationship with then-captain Andrew Strauss.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

While the discussion turned serious for Pietersen, Swift admitted she was still trying to wrap her head around the game. “I’ve never been to a cricket match,” she confessed, before adding, “But I went to Lord’s today.” Pietersen jumped at the chance to tease her. “If you Google ‘cricket’, you will get a result that ‘Lord’s is the home of cricket.’ So Taylor walked through the door at Lord’s, and said: ‘Cricket, of course I know who you are’. ‘No, you don’t! You don’t know what cricket is!’” he joked. Swift defended herself, describing her limited understanding of the sport. “I know what cricket is. I know it’s relatively violent,” she said, drawing laughter from the audience. She went on to explain where the impression came from. “In an episode of the popular sitcom Friends, Ross Geller is dating an English girl, and in a scene Ross joins his girlfriend’s friends in a game of cricket. He tries to play and he breaks all the bones in his body! It’s wild,” Swift recalled.PollWhich sport do you think is more complex to understand: cricket or rugby?CricketRugbyNeither, they're both simple To this, the host Graham Norton responded with amusement: “Wasn’t that rugby?” Swift too, accepted that she got the two mixed up with an awkward smile on her face.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

'You don’t talk, rookie': Ex-Australia batter recalls Virat Kohli’s fiery reply on his Test debut

Joe Burns recalls his debut Boxing Day Test in 2014 against India, where a brief attempt to sledge Virat Kohli backfired spectacularly.

Joe Burns recalls his debut Boxing Day Test in 2014 against India, where a brief attempt to sledge Virat Kohli backfired spectacularly. Kohli, then emerging as India's Test captain, silenced Burns with a sharp retort and a boundary. Burns learned a valuable lesson about engaging with the fierce competitor, whose leadership shaped India's aggressive cricketing identity. Virat Kohli (X) Former Australia batter and current Italy captain Joe Burns recently shared his experience of encountering Virat Kohli during the 2014-15 Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, where Kohli delivered a sharp response to Burns’ attempt at sledging during his debut match. The incident took place during India’s tour of Australia, which also marked Kohli’s emergence as India’s Test leader following MS Dhoni’s retirement after the Melbourne Test. During the Boxing Day clash, Australia had posted 530 runs, and India’s reply was led by Kohli’s brilliant 169. Burns, who was fielding at bat-pad, recalled trying to engage with Kohli after staying silent for four hours.How Virat Kohli & Ravi Shastri sparked India's Test revolution | Insights from Bharat Arun | #BSEGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! “In my first game, first Test match at the MCG on Boxing Day, I was 24. I was fielding at bat-pad (close to the batter). Virat scored a hundred that day. There was a bit of chirp going on, not sledging, just the usual with Hadzi (Brad Haddin) behind the stumps and Watto (Shane Watson) at first slip. Nathan Lyon was bowling and I was in close. After four hours of silence, I finally said one line to him: ‘Virat, you’ve got to play some shots,’” Burns recounted. Kohli’s response was immediate and unforgettable. Burns described the moment: “He stopped Nathan Lyon mid-run, turned to me and said, ‘You don’t talk, rookie.’ The very next ball, he smacked it through covers. It was very embarrassing for me. I didn’t say a word for the next four days, but it showed me Virat was not someone to mess with. As a 24-year-old debutant at bat-pad, I realised I picked the wrong player and the wrong time to speak,” he told CricTracker.PollWhich aspect of Kohli's game do you admire the most?His batting skillsHis leadership qualitiesHis competitive nature The 2014-15 tour proved significant for Kohli, who amassed 692 runs in eight innings, including four centuries. The series cemented his leadership credentials as he stepped in for Dhoni, who missed the first match and later announced his retirement. Reflecting on Kohli’s impact, Burns said: “Virat Kohli doesn’t take a backward step. He really shaped that team’s identity. Even now, when he’s not in the team, you can see India still play in the mould of what he built over the years. He was always a fierce competitor. Personally, I tried not to look at him on the field because I knew that spurred him on.” Burns, who recently led Italy to their maiden T20 World Cup qualification, added: “I didn’t want to engage with him because he thrived on that. He’s a world-class batter, one of the greatest of all time. That combination of skill and competitiveness defined him, and it set the tone for Indian cricket.” Kohli’s career statistics underline his greatness, with 9,230 runs in 123 Test matches. The incident with Burns during the Boxing Day Test was a small but telling example of Kohli’s ability to respond to challenges with both words and performance.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

USA Cricket severs ties with strategic partner ACE; risks bankruptcy

USA Cricket has ended its agreement with American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), the force behind Major League Cricket, leading to uncertainty surrounding World Cup preparations and financial stability. The decision, driven by board members, raises concerns about potential bankruptcy due to the loss of ACE's financial support, which has totalled over $10 million since 2019.

The decision, driven by board members, raises concerns about potential bankruptcy due to the loss of ACE's financial support, which has totalled over $10 million since 2019. A fan watches a cricket match during the third season of Major League Cricket in USA. (Sportzpics) USA Cricket has formally terminated its 50-year agreement with American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), the company behind Major League Cricket, following a three-hour board meeting, reported Cricbuzz. The decision, supported by Chairman Venu Pisike and a faction of board members, has created uncertainty around World Cup preparations and financial stability for the organisation that has been under ICC suspension since July 2024.The termination notice was initiated by Chairman Venu Pisike and Board Member David Haubert, gaining support from Srini Salver, Anj Balusu, and Pintoo Shah. This group outvoted opposing directors Nadia Gruny, Kuljit Nijjar, Atul Rai, and Arjun Gona.Major League Cricket 2025 Explained: Teams, Schedule & Where to WatchThe original partnership, established in June 2019, granted ACE exclusive rights to operate a premier T20 league in the United States and manage the commercialisation of national teams and cricket infrastructure development.USA Cricket CEO Johnathan Atkeison and legal counsel present at the meeting expressed concerns about the decision. The board's legal counsel indicated that the termination might not withstand arbitration, while an external attorney reportedly labeled the decision as "reckless."The financial implications of this decision are significant. Sources indicate that USA Cricket could face bankruptcy within weeks without ACE's quarterly payments. Since 2019, ACE has provided over $10 million in support for sanction fees, operating costs, and player payments.The dispute primarily focuses on the management and finances of the US National Team. USA Cricket has expressed their desire for Major League Cricket to continue operations, noting that MLC's ICC sanction removes dependency on USA Cricket for continuity.The termination impacts immediate preparation plans for the World Cup. A $700,000 budget and access to MLC venues in Dallas and Morrisville were being arranged to support preparatory fixtures for National Men's, Women's, and Junior programs, including matches against West Indies A and West Indies Women's team in October.The conflict escalated on June 23 when USA Cricket issued a termination warning citing various alleged breaches by ACE. The entity responded in July by addressing these claims point by point, but USA Cricket proceeded with the termination notice without further communication.According to documents reviewed by Cricbuzz, only two claims qualify as material breaches under the termination clause: failure to pay yearly minimum guarantees and failure to construct a high-performance centre. Bank records show ACE has maintained quarterly minimum-guarantee payments.In response to the high-performance centre requirements, ACE stated in their July communication that the facility in Grand Prairie was developed in consultation with USA Cricket leadership. They noted that it "exceeds the standards of high performance centres of most other ICC Associate nations, and has even been deemed of sufficient standard for the ICC to conduct World Cup matches in 2024."Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

'Jaiswal is better than Gill'- Ex India batter sparks selection debate

The selection of India's Asia Cup 2025 squad is creating controversy. Yashasvi Jaiswal is surprisingly left out. Shubman Gill makes a comeback to the T20I team. He is also appointed as the vice-captain. Experts are questioning Jaiswal's exclusion despite his strong performance. Sai Sudharsan's omission is also raising concerns.

The selection of India's Asia Cup 2025 squad is creating controversy. Yashasvi Jaiswal is surprisingly left out. Shubman Gill makes a comeback to the T20I team. He is also appointed as the vice-captain. Experts are questioning Jaiswal's exclusion despite his strong performance. Sai Sudharsan's omission is also raising concerns. Subramaniam Badrinath highlights potential recency bias in the selection process.  Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal India’s Asia Cup 2025 squad has stirred debate after the omission of star opener Yashasvi Jaiswal, leaving fans and former cricketers questioning the selection choices. Shubman Gill returns to the T20I squad for the first time since July 2024, and the BCCI has handed him the vice-captaincy role, a clear sign of faith in the youngster’s leadership. Jaiswal, who has been a key figure in India’s T20 set-up, was named among the reserve players despite his impressive record. He has scored 723 runs in 23 T20Is, including a century and five fifties at a strike rate of over 164. In the IPL 2025, he continued his excellent form, scoring 559 runs in 14 matches with six half-centuries at a strike rate of 160. His omission has raised eyebrows among cricket experts.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Former Chennai Super Kings player Subramaniam Badrinath weighed in on the decision, calling it a positive move to back Shubman Gill, but questioning the rationale behind leaving out players like Jaiswal and Sai Sudharsan.“I see this mostly as a positive that they are backing a youngster and projecting him for the future. But what about Yashasvi Jaiswal? He has done even better than Shubman Gill. Also, why has Sai Sudharsan missed out after scoring 700 runs in IPL 2025 and performing better than Shubman Gill? Sanju Samson himself is now in doubt to start in the playing 11,” Badrinath said on his YouTube channel.PollDo you agree with the exclusion of Yashasvi Jaiswal from India's Asia Cup 2025 squad?Yes, it was the right decision.No, he should have been included. Badrinath further questioned whether the selection was influenced by recency bias, a trend often seen in Indian cricket where players performing well in the immediate past are preferred, even if their overall numbers are stronger. He added, “So while backing Shubman Gill, you ask what wrong have Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sai Sudharsan done when their numbers are better than Gill’s. It’s not a bad decision but one that’s 50-50.”While Shubman Gill’s leadership and experience are valued, many feel that Yashasvi Jaiswal’s consistency and impact make him deserving of a more prominent role. Most likely, India will open the innings with Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma, leaving the middle order to accommodate other key batters, including Sanju Samson, who may have to adapt to a new role.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

The Highveld will then take centre stage. Centurion is scheduled to host the Eliminator on Thursday, January 22, while the Wanderers in Johannesburg will stage Qualifier 2 the following day, which decides the second finalist. All previous SA20 finals have been played in front of capacity crowds, and League Commissioner Graeme Smith expects that trend to continue. “SA20 Season 4 is shaping up to be an incredibly exciting summer of cricket, kicking off on Boxing Day and running through the holiday period,” Smith said. “Last year Newlands sold out all five matches at the venue and with the Final taking place on a Sunday, it sets up an incredible afternoon with great weather, entertainment and a lively atmosphere to crown our Season 4 Champions.” Smith also highlighted Durban’s new role in the Playoffs. “Durban will host a Playoff for the first time and we’re hoping this will excite the fans, especially because the two best teams of the competition will be playing in that Qualifier 1,” he said. “We’re also excited to go back to Centurion and Wanderers on the Thursday and Friday nights, it’s always key to have the venues close together because the matches are a day apart.” The Commissioner admitted scheduling the knockout stages is always a challenge given the short turnaround after the group phase. “It's always an interesting challenge for us to get the scheduling of the Playoff matches done and done well. Especially after an exciting Group Match stage that finishes two days before the first Playoff match. I am looking forward to seeing who will be competing.”PollDo you think Durban hosting a Playoff for the first time will attract more fans?Yes, definitelyNo, it won't make a difference The announcement of the Final and Playoff venues comes ahead of the Season 4 Player Auction on September 9, when the six franchises will complete their 19-player squads.

Mohammad Rizwan (AFP Photo) NEW DELHI: Things are not going Pakistan’s star wicketkeeper-batter Mohammad Rizwan’s way.

SUBSCRIBE NOW!Playing for St Kitts and Nevis Patriots, Rizwan managed only 3 runs before being dismissed by spinner Jomel Warrican. Attempting a sweep, he missed the turn completely, lost his balance, fell to the ground, and saw his stumps shattered. The dismissal drew laughter from players on the field and even from the opposition dressing room. He was badly trolled on social media as well. Champions Trophy: 'India put in more effort, were braver than us,' admits Mohammad RizwanA dejected Rizwan shook his head in disappointment as he walked back to the pavilion.Earlier, the PCB had scrapped the top category of its central contracts after a series of poor results, demoting former captains Babar Azam and Rizwan to category B for the first time since the system was introduced 21 years ago.Despite being among Pakistan’s biggest cricketing names, both Azam and Rizwan lost their places in the T20I squads for the upcoming tri-series and Asia Cup following inconsistent performances over the past year.Joining them in category B are T20I captain Salman Agha, Fakhar Zaman, Abrar Ahmed, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Saim Ayub, Shadab Khan, and Shaheen Shah Afridi. Meanwhile, Test skipper Shan Masood was pushed further down, from category B to D.Pakistan’s decline has been stark across formats. They beat England 2-1 in a home Test series last year but subsequently lost 2-0 in South Africa and drew 1-1 at home against a struggling West Indies, finishing last in the World Test Championship.In ODIs, Pakistan registered their first series win in Australia in 22 years and blanked South Africa 3-0, but then suffered a shocking first-round exit from the Champions Trophy, which they co-hosted with Dubai.The downward spiral continued in T20Is as well, with a first-round exit at last year’s T20 World Cup and a 2-1 series defeat in Bangladesh.Pakistan will next feature in a tri-series in Sharjah from August 29, also involving Afghanistan and the United Arab Emirates, followed by the Asia Cup in Dubai.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Ashwin defended himself, while recalling Mitchell Starc's playful reference to the video during the Indore Test. R Ashwin and Rahul Dravid  NEW DELHI: Former India head coach Rahul Dravid and senior spinner Ravichandran Ashwin revisited a controversial moment from the 2023 Border-Gavaskar Trophy during the latest episode of Kutti Stories with Ash. The incident revolved around Ashwin facing backlash for allegedly helping Australia through a Tamil-language YouTube video on playing spin in India.The controversy erupted after Ashwin uploaded the video following Australia’s defeat in the second Test. The criticism intensified when India lost the third Test at Indore, with social media users accusing Ashwin of “coaching” the opposition. The channel was eventually forced to change the video’s thumbnail.Rahul Dravid reflects on RR's narrow losses: 'One or two hits away in every game'Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

So that's the one I've seen about you.

And I'm thinking, Ash, the series is not over," Dravid said.Ashwin responded in his defence: "If I knew how to do that, I would have told our boys how to play spin. I mean, why would I go and tell the Aussies?"Dravid admitted he was joking but also revealed he too had faced flak at the time. "The flak I got was 'Ashwin is coaching better than you are — what are you doing?'" he said with a laugh.PollDo you think Ashwin's YouTube video gave Australia an unfair advantage?Yes, it definitely helped themNo, it was just a learning resourceAshwin also recalled a conversation with Mitchell Starc during the Indore Test: "An interesting thing was that (Mitchell) Starc came and told me. I mean, he bowled a bumper, and I just left it in the Indore Test match. I think we were 80 for 7 or something. We went for lunch, and he was walking with me. He was like, 'Can I tell you how to play the bouncer like your YouTube video?'"Dravid further joked that the Australians might have found a translator: "It's good to know that Starc knows Tamil.

'He backs players he likes': Gambhir questioned over Shreyas Iyer snub

Sadagoppan Ramesh has ignited controversy by alleging that Gautam Gambhir didn't support Shreyas Iyer's Asia Cup inclusion, despite Iyer's stellar form, including a strong IPL and Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy performance. Ramesh also questioned the praise surrounding India's drawn Test series in England and highlighted Iyer's pivotal role in the Champions Trophy victory, where he was India's top scorer.

Gautam Gambhir (AFP Photo) NEW DELHI: Former India opener Sadagoppan Ramesh has alleged that head coach Gautam Gambhir did not support Shreyas Iyer’s inclusion in the Asia Cup squad, despite the batter’s outstanding form in recent tournaments. His remarks come amid ongoing criticism of BCCI chief selector Ajit Agarkar over Iyer’s omission from the squad for the Asia Cup, scheduled to begin on September 9 in the UAE.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Iyer has been in prolific touch this season, amassing 604 runs in the 2025 IPL at a strike rate of 174, along with more than 300 runs in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy at a strike rate of 188. Yet, he failed to find a place in India’s 15-member Asia Cup squad.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Ramesh also questioned the narrative around India’s recent 2-2 Test series draw in England, led by Shubman Gill in the absence of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.PollShould Shreyas Iyer have been included in the Asia Cup squad?Yes, he deserves a spot.No, there are better options."He backs the players he likes but completely lets go of those he doesn't. Winning consistently abroad had started long back under Kohli and Shastri. But now, just the drawn series in England is being projected as a big achievement in Gambhir's track record," Ramesh said.He pointed out Iyer’s crucial role in India’s Champions Trophy triumph earlier this year, where he was India’s top scorer with 243 runs—second overall behind New Zealand’s Rachin Ravindra (263)."Gambhir's biggest achievement remains the Champions Trophy triumph, and Iyer was the biggest reason for that success. Yet, Gambhir is not backing him. Someone like Jaiswal, who is an X-factor player, must play all formats. Keeping him in standby is a poor move," Ramesh added.The former opener stressed that Iyer’s form and confidence made him indispensable to India’s white-ball setup."Shreyas Iyer produced incredible performances in the same UAE during the Champions Trophy and should be a permanent fixture in India's white-ball teams. Players must be backed when they are high on confidence and in form, not when they fade away.

Rajasthan Royals coach Rahul Dravid (PTI Photo) Former Indian cricket legend Rahul Dravid has named Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath and Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan as the toughest bowlers he faced during his 16-year international career spanning from 1996 to 2012. Dravid, who played 164 Tests, 344 ODIs, and one T20I, made this revelation during a recent appearance on Kutti Stories with Ash, hosted by R Ashwin.During his illustrious career, Dravid encountered numerous world-class bowlers including Shane Warne, Brett Lee, Shaun Pollock, Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, Shoaib Akhtar, Chaminda Vaas, Courtney Walsh, James Anderson, Stuart Board, and Makhaya Ntini.Rahul Dravid reflects on RR's narrow losses: 'One or two hits away in every game'Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!When asked about the most challenging fast bowler he faced, Dravid specifically highlighted Glenn McGrath's exceptional skills and consistency. He did, however, point out that Akram's abilities were on the downward curve in the fag end of his career."As a fast bowler, it had to be Glenn McGrath. I thought McGrath was… I kind of played Wasim (Akram) and Waqar (Younis) at the back end of their careers. So it's not kind of fair… People who played Wasim earlier say that he was in a different league, and I could imagine after seeing the videos, I can imagine… And even bowling at the back end of his career, he was damn good. But I played McGrath at his peak. He was a phenomenal bowler. He challenged my off stump more than anyone ever did. Just being able to go close to the stumps, get the bounce and just the level of fitness… He was able to come at you right through the whole day. I have played faster bowlers than him, but in terms of consistency and skill, he must be the toughest bowler I've faced."In terms of spin bowling, Dravid acknowledged Muttiah Muralitharan's exceptional abilities and relentless approach."As a spinner, Muralitharan was the best bowler that I played against. Great skill. He had the ability to spin the ball both ways. Especially when he came round the wicket and got the doosra away from you. So, he was someone who was never tired and bowled really long spells. He kept at you and kept at you… and he is just a phenomenal spinner."McGrath's career statistics demonstrate his dominance in international cricket. He represented Australia in 124 Tests and 250 ODIs from 1993 to 2007, claiming 563 Test wickets and 381 ODI wickets.McGrath holds the distinction of being Australia's most successful fast bowler in Test cricket and maintains the record for the most wickets in ODIs for his country.Muralitharan's career numbers are equally impressive. The Sri Lankan spinner accumulated 800 Test wickets, 534 ODI wickets, and 13 T20I wickets during his international career.Dravid's own career statistics underscore his authority to evaluate these bowlers.

One-dayers remain an unsolved puzzle for Shafali Verma

Shafali Verma, after leading India to U-19 World Cup glory, faced a setback, getting dropped from the ODI World Cup squad due to inconsistent performances. Despite domestic success and WPL flair, she struggles in ODIs, averaging just 23. Pratika Rawal replaced her, capitalizing on opportunities.

Shafali Verma, after leading India to U-19 World Cup glory, faced a setback, getting dropped from the ODI World Cup squad due to inconsistent performances. Despite domestic success and WPL flair, she struggles in ODIs, averaging just 23. Pratika Rawal replaced her, capitalizing on opportunities. Shafali Verma (Photo by Chris Hyde/Getty Images) Chennai: In Jan 2023, when Shafali Verma hoisted the Under-19 Women’s T20 World Cup trophy in South Africa, with tears of joy, she said: “This is just the beginning.” The journey from that “beginning,” though, turned far bumpier than the young opening batter could have imagined, culminating in her getting dropped from the India squad for the ODI World Cup at home starting in September.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! With lean returns in ODIs and a dismal show at home against New Zealand, the axe fell in Nov last year. Shafali was dropped from the ODI squad for the Australia tour and remained out of favour. Her last half-century came in 2022. When the door closed, Shafali turned to domestic cricket and emerged as the leading run-scorer in a format that has troubled her the most. She piled up 527 runs at a strike rate of 152.31 in the One-dayers for Haryana, including a 197 off 115 balls. In March, donning Delhi Capitals jersey in the WPL, she finished as the fourth-highest run-getter overall. In July this year, Shafali roared back in Indian colours and showed flashes of her swagger during the T20I series in England. For all her flair in the shortest format, ODIs remain Shafali’s unsolved puzzle. The batter has managed an average of 23 in 29 matches, and on the recent India A tour of Australia, her performance was underwhelming. So, when her name went missing from the upcoming home ODI World Cup squad, it hardly raised eyebrows. In her place came Pratika Rawal, who made her debut last year, and has made her case with steady returns at an average of 54. The 21-year-old Shafali needs to crack the 50-over format, according to WV Raman, who was India women’s head coach when a 15-year-old Shafali first broke into the scene. Shafali was India’s leading run-getter in the 2020 T20 World Cup, a campaign where India went all the way to the final under Raman’s watch. “She has to work her way back into the team by working on her shortcomings. Basically, she needs to put up consistent performances in the 50-over format as Pratika has grabbed her opportunities and displaced Shafali.PollDo you think Shafali Verma will make a successful comeback to the ODI squad?Yes, she has the talentNo, she needs more timeI’m not sure “The other area that needs improvement is her fielding. What is important is for her is to fight her way back into the team. And she was given a fair bit of leeway when she started. A setback is always good to make a strong comeback,” Raman told TOI. Shafali, who as a kid once walked into an under-12 all-boys local tournament and walked out with the ‘Man of the Match’ and ‘Man of the Series’ medal, has always carried the same audacity to the international stage. Today, even as she faces the first big setback of her international career, the fierce and spunky prodigy still has age and time to turn things around. Shantha Rangaswamy, former chief selector, is confident of Shafali’s comeback. “She’s very talented but she needs to score consistently. Unless she does that, it won’t be fair to drop Pratika, who has done very well. My advice to her is: ‘You (Shafali) have age on your side, you are a talented cricketer, you just need to keep building scores consistently.’ I feel she will definitely make a comeback, because she is a huge talent,” said Shantha, the first captain of the Indian women’s cricket team.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

'You never know': Aussie all-rounder comeback could reshape Australia’s Ashes plans

Cameron Green aims to bowl again before the Ashes, potentially returning in the Sheffield Shield after back surgery sidelined him last year. While he's contributed with the bat, Green believes his bowling will significantly boost Australia against England.

Cameron Green aims to bowl again before the Ashes, potentially returning in the Sheffield Shield after back surgery sidelined him last year. While he's contributed with the bat, Green believes his bowling will significantly boost Australia against England. Cameron Green of Australia (Photo by Paul Harding/Gallo Images/Getty Images) Cameron Green has set his sights on returning to bowling before the Ashes later this year, with a potential comeback in the Sheffield Shield. The Australian all-rounder has not bowled in a competitive match since undergoing back surgery last year, which forced him to miss the entire Test summer. The 26-year-old has made a strong return with the bat, featuring in four Tests since the World Test Championship final and the Caribbean tour. He has also become an important part of Australia’s white-ball setup. However, Green believes his ability to bowl could significantly strengthen Australia against England. “I’m not quite certain which match I’ll bowl in, but I’m feeling really good, in a good spot,” he told Fox Sports. “It’s exciting being back bowling at a reasonable intensity.”Pat Cummins on WTC Final: 'Cameron Green deserves a spot in the lineup'Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

He scored a half-century and two knocks in the 40s but also registered two single-digit scores against South Africa at Lord’s. With Australia still unsettled at the top of the order for the Ashes opener in Perth this November, his batting position remains uncertain. “You never know,” Green said. “There are a lot of guys who can fill that role. I’m proud I was able to step up there, but wait and see.”PollDo you think Cameron Green will successfully return to bowling before the Ashes?Yes, definitelyNo, he will need more timeSteve Smith is expected to bat at No.4, with Travis Head at five. All-rounder Beau Webster has slotted in at No.6 but could make way if Green resumes bowling duties. Green has marked the Sheffield Shield as crucial preparation, planning to get valuable overs under his belt for Western Australia. “In the past, it’s worked really well when I focused on Shield cricket,” he explained. “That might be the best way to return to bowling, getting a few overs across a few days.
