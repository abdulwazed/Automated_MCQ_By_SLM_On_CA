UAE's "We are the UAE 2031" aims to double the nation’s GDP to AED 3 trillion through AI, tech, and talent-driven growth/ Representative image In a renewed push to position the United Arab Emirates as one of the world’s most attractive destinations for high-calibre professionals, the Global Talent Attraction and Retention Committee has convened to discuss the implementation of the second phase of its National Talent Attraction and Retention Strategy 2024–2027. The strategy, which aligns with the broader We the UAE 2031 vision, outlines a unified national framework to attract exceptional minds to the UAE’s priority sectors and foster an environment that retains them long-term.Strengthening the UAE’s global talent strategyThe Global Talent Attraction and Retention Committee was established under a Cabinet decision as a key mechanism to oversee the implementation of the UAE’s national strategy for attracting and retaining global talent. It is mandated to coordinate national efforts across government and private sector entities to build a sustainable, future-ready talent ecosystem. The committee chaired by Dr. Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, Minister of Foreign Trade and the official in charge of the talent strategy, met recently to evaluate and advance the initiatives under the second phase of the National Talent Attraction and Retention Strategy 2024-2027. It serves as a central driver of the UAE’s efforts to cultivate a globally competitive talent ecosystem. This second phase of the strategy includes a series of initiatives to be executed collaboratively across federal and local government entities as well as the private sector. Among its key goals are:  Attracting professionals in strategic economic sectors   Launching global promotional campaigns to spotlight the UAE as a hub for talent   Organizing international events focused on talent attraction and development   The committee includes representatives from a wide range of national bodies:  Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation   Ministry of Education   Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research   Ministry of Community Empowerment   Ministry of Culture   Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Ports Security   Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Center   Abu Dhabi Residents Office (Department of Economic Development – Abu Dhabi   Department of Economy and Tourism – Dubai   Emirates Scientists Council   Emirates Council for Artificial Intelligence and Digital Transactions   During the session, members shared insights on emerging trends and best practices from around the world and exchanged ideas for new projects that align with the UAE’s long-term talent goals.Key focus areas and strategic objectivesThe UAE’s talent strategy is built around four foundational axes:  Executing the national strategy to attract and retain high-value talent   Empowering the knowledge economy by ensuring a steady influx of strategic talent   Establishing the UAE as a preferred destination for global talent through sustained visibility and competitiveness   Improving the UAE’s international rankings in talent attraction and retention, especially within global competitiveness indices   The government’s aim is to establish the UAE not just as a workplace, but as a permanent base for global professionals, offering them long-term growth, inclusion, and a sense of belonging. Dr. Al Zeyoudi emphasized that this integrated ecosystem is essential to maintaining the UAE’s momentum in becoming one of the top 10 global talent destinations by 2031. He also noted the significant progress the UAE has already achieved. As per the 2024 Global Talent Competitiveness Report by the International Institute for Management Development (IMD):  The UAE ranks 17th globally and 1st in the Arab world   It climbed five places compared to 2023   It ranks 12th globally in the “Gravity Index”   It holds the 2nd position globally in the “Readiness Index”   These advancements, Dr. Al Zeyoudi said, are driven by the UAE’s forward-looking leadership and continuous strategic planning aimed at ensuring sustainable economic growth powered by human capital.Target sectors and long-term visionThe Cabinet-approved second phase of the Global Talent Attraction Strategy 2031 will focus heavily on sectors that are central to the UAE’s economic future. These include:  Technology   Renewable energy   Healthcare and biotechnology   Logistics and aviation   Advanced industries   Financial services   Food and water technology   Creative economy   At the core of this strategy is the intention to not only attract talent but to ensure that the UAE has the right talent in the right sectors, supporting innovation, diversification, and long-term sustainability. Three specific targets guide the broader Talent Attraction and Retention Strategy:  Positioning the UAE among the top 10 countries in global talent competitiveness   Ensuring talent availability across all strategic sectors   Solidifying the UAE’s reputation as an ideal place to live, work, and invest   The UAE's approach integrates policy development, talent ecosystem support, and international partnerships — building a comprehensive framework that supports both inbound investment and professional migration.Alignment with the “We the UAE 2031” visionThe committee’s work aligns directly with the “We the UAE 2031” vision, the country’s long-term strategic plan unveiled on November 22, 2022, during the UAE Government Annual Meetings. This national blueprint aims to:  Strengthen the UAE’s international standing   Achieve economic diversification   Enhance quality of life for residents   Cement the UAE’s place among the world’s top financial centres   With its core pillars, Forward Society, Forward Economy, Forward Diplomacy, and Forward Ecosystem, the vision leverages artificial intelligence, digital transformation, and strategic investments to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth. A key economic benchmark set by the plan is doubling the UAE’s GDP from AED 1.49 trillion to AED 3 trillion by 2031. Talent is central to this transformation, serving as both a catalyst and beneficiary of the UAE’s shift towards a knowledge- and innovation-based economy. The implementation of “We the UAE 2031” is supported through robust public-private partnerships and global cooperation, ensuring that the vision’s impact extends across sectors and communities.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

‘War crime that should haunt us all’: UN declares first Middle East famine in Gaza City; Israel dismisses claim as ‘Hamas lies’

The United Nations confirms famine in Gaza City. This marks the first official famine in the Middle East. The crisis may spread without a ceasefire and aid. UN aid chief Tom Fletcher says obstruction by Israel is the reason. Israel rejects the report, calling it false. The IPC uses strict criteria for famine classification.

The United Nations confirms famine in Gaza City. This marks the first official famine in the Middle East. The crisis may spread without a ceasefire and aid. UN aid chief Tom Fletcher says obstruction by Israel is the reason. Israel rejects the report, calling it false. The IPC uses strict criteria for famine classification. After almost 3 years of war, UN declares a famine in Gaza City  The United Nations on Friday confirmed that famine has struck Gaza City, marking the first officially declared famine in the Middle East. The declaration came from the integrated food security phase classification (IPC), the world’s leading authority on food crises.The IPC report said famine was now occurring in the Gaza Governorate, which includes Gaza City and accounts for around 20 per cent of the territory. Experts cautioned that the crisis could extend to southern areas like Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah without an immediate ceasefire and full access for humanitarian aid.‘A famine that haunts us all’: UN aid chief UN aid chief Tom Fletcher delivered a message during a briefing in Geneva, saying the famine was entirely preventable. “It is a famine that we could have prevented if we had been allowed. Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel,” Fletcher said. He called the situation “a famine that will and must haunt us all”.UN rights chief Volker Turk said "it is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare", moments after famine was declared.According to the IPC, from early July to mid-August, Gaza witnessed the sharpest deterioration in food security since monitoring began. One-third of Gaza’s population is projected to face catastrophic levels of hunger by the end of next month, the report stated.‘Hamas lies’: Israeli governmentIsraeli foreign ministry dismissed the UN-backed report as “false and biased”. In a statement, it said: “There is no famine in Gaza,” and claimed the findings were based on “Hamas lies laundered through organisations with vested interests”.Similarly, COGAT, the Israeli military agency responsible for aid transfers, called the report “false and biased” and said significant steps have been taken recently to increase aid delivery to Gaza.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also rejected reports of starvation.Why is Gaza now officially in famine?Famine classification requires strict conditions to be met, and the IPC uses a globally recognised system. It labels an area as being in famine when three criteria are confirmed:At least 20 per cent of households face extreme food shortages.At least 30 per cent of children aged six months to five years suffer from acute malnutrition by weight-to-height measurement, or 15 per cent based on arm circumference.Two adults or four children under five per 10,000 people die daily from starvation or related disease.The IPC said data collected between July 1 and August 15 showed these thresholds had been reached in Gaza City. Mortality data is harder to confirm due to access restrictions.First famine in the Middle EastThis is the first time the IPC has confirmed famine in the Middle East. The organisation has previously declared famine in Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and parts of Sudan’s Darfur region in 2023.The IPC includes over a dozen UN agencies, governments, and humanitarian organisations. An independent Famine Review Committee (FRC) also verified the Gaza findings, adding another layer of scrutiny.Why are deaths hard to trackExperts note that deaths during famine often occur from a combination of malnutrition and infection rather than hunger alone. “There are no standard guidelines for physicians to classify cause of death as ‘malnutrition’ as opposed to infection,” said Alex de Waal, author of Mass Starvation and executive director of the World Peace Foundation.He explained that diarrhoea and dehydration linked to infections commonly affect children with severe malnutrition. Most excess deaths in such crises result from disease, deprivation, and malnutrition together, rather than starvation alone.The IPC warned that without a ceasefire and unrestricted aid deliveries, famine conditions will spread beyond Gaza City within weeks. “The situation is worsening at an unprecedented pace,” the report said.Since the conflict began on October 7, 2023, following Hamas’ attack on Israel, more than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza’s health ministry.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

China tragedy: Under construction brige collapses into Yellow river; 10 dead, 4 missing

A bridge under construction over the Yellow River in northwest China collapsed on Friday due to a steel cable failure, resulting in at least ten fatalities and four missing individuals. The incident occurred on the Sichuan–Qinghai Railway project, recognized as the world’s largest-span double-track continuous steel truss arch bridge.

A bridge under construction over the Yellow River in northwest China collapsed on Friday due to a steel cable failure, resulting in at least ten fatalities and four missing individuals. The incident occurred on the Sichuan–Qinghai Railway project, recognized as the world’s largest-span double-track continuous steel truss arch bridge.  At least 12 workers have died and four others are missing after an under construction bridge collapsed into the Yellow River in northwest China on Friday, state media said.Footage aired by state broadcaster CCTV captured the moment the arch section of the bridge gave way and crashed into the waters below. According to state news agency Xinhua, the disaster was triggered by a steel cable failure.The People’s Daily reported that 16 people: 15 workers and a project manager had been on site when the structure gave way. CCTV confirmed that ten people were killed, while two others were seriously injured at first and died later. Four people have yet to be found, AFP reported.The bridge, part of the Sichuan–Qinghai Railway, has been hailed as the world’s largest-span double-track continuous steel truss arch bridge. It is also the first railway steel truss arch bridge in China to cross the Yellow River, the country’s second-longest river.Pictures shared by state media showed the broken frame of the unfinished bridge, its middle section missing, with cranes and tall scaffolding towers standing around the site.Hundreds of emergency responders were dispatched to join search and rescue efforts, Xinhua said.Accidents of this kind are not uncommon in China, where enforcement of safety rules is often weak. In December last year, 13 workers went missing after a cave-in at a railway construction site in the southern city of Shenzhen. No survivors were reported.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

UAE: How a heart from a brain-dead child in Abu Dhabi saved the life of 7-year-old Saudi boy

A critically ill seven-year-old Saudi boy received a lifesaving heart transplant at KFSHRC in Riyadh, with the donor heart airlifted from Abu Dhabi. The complex, time-sensitive operation involved seamless cross-border coordination between Saudi and UAE medical authorities. The procedure highlights KFSHRC’s global leadership in cardiac care and the success of Gulf-wide healthcare collaboration.

A critically ill seven-year-old Saudi boy received a lifesaving heart transplant at KFSHRC in Riyadh, with the donor heart airlifted from Abu Dhabi. The complex, time-sensitive operation involved seamless cross-border coordination between Saudi and UAE medical authorities. The procedure highlights KFSHRC’s global leadership in cardiac care and the success of Gulf-wide healthcare collaboration. King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Riyadh is a leading cardiac center known for pioneering advanced robotic heart surgeries/ Representative image In a rare and urgent cross-border medical effort, doctors in Riyadh successfully transplanted a donor heart into a seven-year-old Saudi boy suffering from end-stage heart failure. The heart, retrieved from a brain-dead donor in Abu Dhabi, was transported to Saudi Arabia and implanted in a high-risk surgery coordinated between Saudi and UAE health authorities. This lifesaving procedure underscores both the precision of transplant logistics and the increasing strength of regional healthcare partnerships andcooperation.Complex condition and urgent meed Faisal, a seven-year-old Saudi child, was battling advanced heart failure caused by a congenital defect present since birth. Despite exhaustive treatment attempts, including various medications, respiratory support, and even pacemaker implantation, his condition showed no significant improvement. The severity of his illness necessitated immediate placement on the urgent heart transplant list. With no other viable options left, the transplant became a race against time.The transplant’s success hinged on a narrow five-hour window, the maximum time allowed from organ extraction to transplantation to maintain viability. This time sensitivity posed a significant challenge, especially as the donor was located abroad in Abu Dhabi. Coordinating the extraction, air transport, and preparation of surgical teams required meticulous planning and swift action.According to Dr. Felix Wang Tsai, pediatric cardiology surgery consultant at KFSHRC, Faisal arrived in very critical condition, making the transplant his only chance at survival. KFSHRC typically performs only 10 to 15 heart transplants annually, emphasizing the critical need to increase donor availability within Saudi Arabia to support more patients like Faisal.Seamless cross-border cooperationThe transplant was made possible through the collaboration of the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation and the UAE’s National Program for Donation and Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissue (Hayat). The process involved consent from the donor’s family and all necessary regulatory approvals, underscoring a strong humanitarian partnership between the two countries.Ahmad Jaafari, director of donor affairs and organ allocation at the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation, described how donor data was quickly analyzed and shared with KFSHRC, where Faisal was listed as a high priority patient. With approvals from the Ministry of Health’s medical ethics center, a specialized medical team and private aircraft were dispatched to Abu Dhabi for organ retrieval and rapid transfer. Dr. Hani Al-Sergani, executive director of the Heart Centre of Excellence at KFSHRC, told Arab News that this case exemplifies the maturity of Gulf healthcare collaboration. He emphasized that the successful transplant within hours showcased regional cooperation’s vital role in expanding life-saving opportunities.In a statement, the hospital said, “This marks another successful case of advanced regional cooperation in organ transplantation,”The hospital further confirmed that the life-saving procedure was carried out only after securing donor family consent, all necessary regulatory approvals, and close coordination between the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation and the UAE’s National Program for Donation and Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissue.King Faisal Specialist Hospital’s role and achievementsKFSHRC’s Heart Centre, recognized globally for its advanced cardiac care, played a pivotal role in Faisal’s successful transplant. The hospital has pioneered several groundbreaking cardiac surgeries, including the world’s first fully robotic heart transplant and robotic implantation of artificial heart pumps (BiVAD-HMIII) without chest incisions. These innovations have placed KFSHRC at the forefront of cardiac surgery, cementing its status as the leading cardiac center in the Middle East and North Africa and ranking 15th globally among the world’s top academic medical centers.In 2024, the hospital delivered 293,381 virtual consultations, marking a 58.2% increase year-on-year, reflecting its expanding healthcare reach and integration of advanced technologies. The successful transplant of Faisal’s heart is another milestone in KFSHRC’s mission to provide specialized, cutting-edge care.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

'Free Tina Peters': Donald Trump renews calls to free convicted Colorado official; threatens ‘harsh measures’ if not released



'Free Tina Peters': Donald Trump renews calls to free convicted Colorado official; threatens ‘harsh measures’ if not releasedTOI World Desk / TIMESOFINDIA.COM /  Aug 22, 2025, 17:00 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLarge Donald Trump renews calls to free Tina Peters; threatens ‘harsh measures’ if not released President Donald Trump on Thursday renewed his demand to free Tina Peters, a former county clerk convicted for breaching election equipment in 2020 presidential election. He warned that “harsh measures” would follow if she was not released. “FREE TINA PETERS, a brave and innocent Patriot who has been tortured by Crooked Colorado politicians, including the big Mail-In Ballot supporting governor of the State,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Let Tina Peters out of jail, RIGHT NOW.” Peters, 69, was found guilty by a Colorado jury in 2024 on seven charges, including four felonies, for tampering with Mesa County’s voting machines. She was sentenced in October to nine years in prison for attempting to influence a public servant, conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation and official misconduct. The former Mesa County clerk became a prominent figure among election deniers after she facilitated access to voting systems in search of voter fraud, claims that she and her allies failed to substantiate. She was the first election official charged in connection with a security breach linked to conspiracy theories surrounding the 2020 presidential election. Trump has repeatedly backed Peters, asking the Justice Department in May to intervene on her behalf. This is his second public appeal in recent months for her release. However, Peters was convicted in a Colorado state court, beyond the scope of presidential clemency powers. The president has used her case to intensify attacks on mail-in ballots and to push for sweeping election changes. In March, he signed an executive order requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration and has indicated plans for another order curbing mail-in voting.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Fateh, a 35-year-old Somali American and democratic socialist, had stunned party insiders in July by winning more than 60% of delegate support, defeating incumbent Mayor Jacob Frey for the DFL’s backing. But on Thursday, state party chair Richard Carlbom said a review by the DFL’s Constitution, Bylaws & Rules Committee uncovered “substantial failures” in the convention’s voting process. “A mayoral candidate was errantly eliminated from contention,” Carlbom said, calling for “unity and a focus on electing DFL leaders.” The probe found nearly 200 missing votes, a lost ward credentials book and security lapses in the electronic voting system, which Frey’s campaign had earlier challenged as “highly flawed and untested.” As a result, the Minneapolis DFL was stripped of its authority to endorse a mayoral candidate this year and placed on two-year probation. All candidates will now have equal access to party voter rolls, which are typically reserved for endorsed nominees. Frey welcomed the move, saying, “I am proud to be a member of a party that believes in correcting our mistakes … the outcome now rests squarely where it should — with all the people of Minneapolis.” Fateh, however, condemned the decision as a power grab by party insiders. “Twenty-eight party insiders voted to take away our endorsement behind closed doors,” he said in a video statement, accusing Frey’s supporters and donors of influencing the process. “This is exactly what Minneapolis voters are sick of … Let me be clear. We’re still in this fight, and we’re going to win.” Frey, first elected in 2017 and re-elected in 2021, faced criticism over his handling of the city’s unrest following George Floyd’s killing in 2020. Fateh’s insurgent campaign had drawn parallels to progressive upsets elsewhere, including Zohran Mamdani’s recent victory in New York’s Democratic primary.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Visitors from around the world have been drawn to its engaging displays, sustainable architecture, and human-centric programming — all designed to reflect the UAE’s deep-rooted heritage and its ambitions for a globally inclusive and technologically progressive future.This landmark was marked on August 21st by a celebration on-site. The Pavilion team — including its Youth Ambassadors — welcomed guests with their hallmark hospitality, creating a moment of shared reflection and connection. These Youth Ambassadors have played an integral role in shaping the Pavilion experience, facilitating storytelling, encouraging cultural conversations, and leaving a meaningful impression on the millions of visitors who’ve walked through the Pavilion’s doors.Architecture with purpose: A pavilion rooted in sustainability and visionBehind the Pavilion’s unique identity is its design, crafted by the Earth to Ether Design Collective — a collaboration of architects and creatives from the UAE, Japan, and other global partners. The structure is built with 90 architectural columns, inspired by the form and resilience of the date palm, and constructed using agricultural palm waste. This design not only pays homage to the UAE’s natural heritage but also embodies sustainable principles and an ethos of shared global progress.Inside, the Pavilion invites visitors on a journey across five thematic zones. Each space is thoughtfully curated to highlight key areas where the UAE is making bold strides, including:Space explorationHealthcare innovationSustainable technologiesCultural heritageInteractive installations, sensory-driven storytelling, and a clear narrative flow allow visitors to explore these themes in a deeply engaging, memorable way.A cultural hub: Programming that brings the UAE to lifeBeyond its architectural and thematic appeal, the UAE Pavilion has grown into a daily cultural destination within Expo 2025. Its dynamic programming includes:Expert talks on innovation and sustainabilityCreative workshops led by artists and designersLive performances and artistic showcasesInteractive culinary experiences featuring traditional Emirati cuisineThese daily activities draw both casual visitors and dedicated Expo participants, many of whom return for second or even third visits — a strong indicator of the Pavilion’s emotional and cultural impact.A notable highlight is the Pavilion’s food program. At the heart of it is Japan’s first-ever Emirati restaurant, located within the Pavilion, which has already attracted over 100,000 visitors. Traditional dishes such as lamb ouzi, loqaimat (sweet dumplings), and a signature drink made from camel milk, rehash, and toasted pistachio have offered Japanese and international guests a taste of Emirati hospitality and culinary tradition.In addition, summer culinary workshops for children and families have proven especially popular, with young Japanese participants learning the art of pastry-making under the guidance of Emirati chefs. These sessions not only share flavours but stories — offering a chance for participants to connect with Emirati culture through personal and sensory experiences.A message of unity as expo continuesCommenting on the milestone, Shihab Alfaheem, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the UAE to Japan and Commissioner General of the UAE Pavilion, reflected on the significance of the Pavilion’s impact:“Reaching the three million mark is a huge milestone for the UAE Pavilion. It is a cherished achievement, and speaks to the global resonance of the UAE’s story and our shared aspirations for the future. Every visitor who walks through the Pavilion brings their own voice to our collective journey. Together, we are shaping a narrative that crosses borders, embraces diversity, and accelerates progress. With two months remaining, we want more guests to experience our pavilion.”With Expo 2025 running until October 13, the Pavilion remains open and active — continuing to welcome visitors with the same warmth, curiosity, and openness that has defined its success so far.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Watch: Indian truck driver brought to Florida for trial - Harjinder Singh's deadly U-turn pauses US work visas

Harjinder Singh, an Indian-origin truck driver, was extradited from California to Florida to face vehicular homicide charges after a fatal U-turn resulted in three deaths. Following the incident, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced an immediate pause on all commercial truck driver work visas, citing safety concerns and the impact on American truckers' livelihoods. The move comes after Singh's reckless actions led to a tragic crash.

Harjinder Singh, an Indian-origin truck driver, was extradited from California to Florida to face vehicular homicide charges after a fatal U-turn resulted in three deaths. Following the incident, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced an immediate pause on all commercial truck driver work visas, citing safety concerns and the impact on American truckers' livelihoods. The move comes after Singh's reckless actions led to a tragic crash.  Indian-origin driver, Harjinder Singh, who is facing three counts of vehicular homicide for making a reckless U-turn at a Florida highway, killing three, was sent back to Sunshine State after fleeing to sanctuary state California. Later, US President Donald Trump's administration announced that it was halting all work visas for commercial drivers. Video of Singh, 28, has gone viral, where he is seen being loaded onto a plane in California on Thursday to fly him back to Flroida. Another video has circulated on social media, capturing Florida lieutenant governor Jay Collins escorting the illegal immigrant truck driver as he arrived back in the city to face charges.The Indian-origin trucker was arrested by the US Marshals in California after he fled the city following the August 12 crash. "We're here today because of tragedy," Collins told reporters as he was escorting Singh. "Three lives lost. Three Floridians' lives ended early."PollShould stricter regulations be imposed on commercial drivers to prevent reckless behavior?YesNoAfter Singh was brought back to Florida, US secretary of state Marco Rubio, within a few hours, announced a pause to all issuances of commercial truck driver work visas."The increasing number of foreign drivers operating large tractor-trailer trucks on US roads is endangering American lives and undercutting the livelihoods of American truckers," Rubio wrote on social media.He added that the pause was "effective immediately."All three people in the minivan died after it crashed into the truck as Singh made a reckless U-turn, leaving no space for the smaller vehicle to escape.

Erik Menendez denied parole after nearly 36 yrs in prison; misconduct behind bars cited

Erik Menendez was denied parole after California commissioners cited his continued misconduct behind bars, indicating he remains a public safety risk. Despite relatives' pleas for his release, the board highlighted repeated violations, including illegal phone use and drug smuggling. These actions demonstrated a selfish attitude and disregard for rules, outweighing the gravity of the original crime in their decision.

Erik Menendez appears before the parole board via teleconference (Picture credit: AP) California parole commissioners have denied Erik Menendez’s request for release, saying his misconduct behind bars showed he remains a risk to public safety.The 54-year-old, who, along with his brother Lyle, murdered their parents Jose and Kitty Menendez, in 1989, faced his first parole hearing on Thursday. A two-member board ruled he will not be eligible again for another three years, as per news agency AP.Commissioner Robert Barton told him, “Contrary to your supporters’ beliefs, you have not been a model prisoner, and frankly, we find that a little disturbing.” He said repeated violations, particularly illegal use of mobile phones, showed a “selfish” attitude and belief that rules did not apply to him.According to ABC News, Barton noted that Erik’s behaviour in prison, including inappropriate contact with visitors, drug smuggling, misuse of computers and violent incidents, was the primary reason for the decision, rather than the gravity of the crime. “We find that you continue to pose an unreasonable risk to public safety,” he said, as quoted by ABC News.The hearing, which lasted nearly 10 hours, came 36 years and one day after the killings. “Today is the day all my victims learned my parents were dead,” Erik told the panel. Relatives, many of whom have forgiven him, gave emotional statements urging his release. His aunt Teresita Menendez-Baralt, battling cancer, said, “More than anything, I hope I live long enough to welcome him into my home.”Erik and Lyle Menendez were sentenced to life without parole in 1996, but a judge in May resentenced them to 50 years to life, making them immediately eligible under youth offender laws.Los Angeles County district attorney Nathan Hochman opposed parole, arguing the brothers “have not demonstrated full insight into their crimes.” According to AP, he compared them to Sirhan Sirhan, the assassin of Robert F Kennedy, who was also denied release over lack of insight.Lyle Menendez, now 57, is due for his parole hearing on Friday.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

California redistricting row: Governor Newsom clears new map bill

California lawmakers approved a redrawn congressional map. This aims to boost Democrats in the next elections. Governor Gavin Newsom signed the bills and called a special election for November 4. The plan seeks to add five House seats for Democrats. Republicans oppose the move. Former President Barack Obama supports California's action. Former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger will oppose any changes.

(Picture credit: AP) California has set up a high-stakes ballot fight after lawmakers approved a redrawn congressional map aimed at boosting Democrats in next year’s elections, directly countering a Republican plan in Texas backed by US President Donald Trump.The Democratic-controlled Legislature passed the bills on Thursday, and Governor Gavin Newsom swiftly signed them, also calling a special election for 4 November for voters to approve the changes. “This is not something six weeks ago that I ever imagined that I’d be doing,” Newsom said at a press conference, calling the move a reaction to “an assault on our democracy in Texas,” as reported by news agency AP.The plan is designed to help Democrats pick up five additional House seats, while Republicans in Texas are advancing a map with the same goal for themselves. According to the New York Times, Trump has urged Republican-led states, including Indiana, Missouri and Ohio to pursue similar mid-decade redraws in an attempt to secure a stronger GOP majority in the 2026 midterms.Republicans in California have fiercely opposed the governor’s approach. James Gallagher, the Republican minority leader in the state Assembly, said Trump was “wrong” to push for new GOP seats but warned Newsom’s “fight fire with fire” strategy was reckless.“You move forward fighting fire with fire, and what happens? You burn it all down,” he told colleagues, as quoted by The New York Times.The proposal would temporarily replace the maps drawn by California’s independent redistricting commission, a system approved by voters in 2008 and 2010 to keep politics out of the process. IIf voters approve, the new map will last until 2030, after which authority to draw districts would revert to the commission.Democrats argue that the move is necessary to balance out partisan tactics elsewhere. “What do we do, just sit back and do nothing? Or do we fight back?” state senator Lena Gonzalez asked during the debate, as per AP.Former President Barack Obama has endorsed Newsom’s push, saying during a fundraiser this week that while he usually supports nonpartisan redistricting, this was “a smart, measured approach” given Texas’s actions.But opposition is mounting. Former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who helped establish California’s commission, has said that he’ll oppose any redistricting changes. Wealthy donors like Charles Munger Jr have also promised to defend the system during the fall campaign, according to The New York Times.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Melee over ‘Chicken tenders’ at sea: Carnival Cruise ship turns chaotic as passengers trade punches; video goes viralTOI World Desk / TIMESOFINDIA.COM /  Aug 22, 2025, 11:25 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLarge Carnival Cruise ship turns chaotic as passengers trade punches (Source: Instagram/@mikeisterra) A late-night craving for chicken tenders spiralled into chaos aboard a Carnival Cruise ship when a brawl erupted near the buffet line at midnight. Videos circulating online show several passengers trading punches as security staff struggled to restore order. Witnesses said the melee began around 2 am on Monday on the ship Carnival Sunshine, just hours before the vessel was due to dock in Miami.Content creator Mike Terra filmed the brawl and posted the video on Instagram @mikeisterra. Captioning the clip, he wrote: “I always hear Carnival is ghetto/ratchet. I have been cruising for years, but this is my first time seeing some action on a ship.”"Over chicken tenders,” the video maker claimed, though the exact reason behind the fight remained unclear. However, the dispute quickly escalated, drawing in nearly two dozen people. The seven-day cruise had sailed from Miami last Thursday, stopping at two Bahamian ports before returning to Florida.

Ukraine security: Europe to provide majority of forces; Trump leaves open possibility of US air support

Military leaders from the US and European allies are developing security guarantees for Ukraine, following Trump's pledge to help protect the nation as part of a settlement with Moscow. Discussions involve potential strategies, with Europe taking the lead in deployment and the US playing a supporting role. While Trump ruled out ground troops, he signaled openness to other military support.

Military leaders from the US and European allies are developing security guarantees for Ukraine, following Trump's pledge to help protect the nation as part of a settlement with Moscow. Discussions involve potential strategies, with Europe taking the lead in deployment and the US playing a supporting role. While Trump ruled out ground troops, he signaled openness to other military support.  Military leaders from the United States and key European allies have drawn up options for providing security guarantees to Ukraine, officials confirmed on Thursday, marking a significant step in ongoing efforts to end Russia’s nearly four-year war.According to a report from Reuters, the proposals were presented to national security advisers from both sides of the Atlantic after US President Donald Trump pledged to help protect Ukraine as part of any settlement with Moscow. A Pentagon statement said US and European planners had developed military options for “appropriate consideration,” following a Reuters report that first revealed the deliberations.Allies gather in WashingtonThe chiefs of defence from the US, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the UK, and Ukraine met in Washington between Tuesday and Thursday to hash out potential strategies. According to Reuters, sources said discussions focused on how Europe could take the lead in any deployment, with the US likely playing a supporting role.US secretary of state and national security Adviser Marco Rubio later held a conference call with his European counterparts, including UK national security adviser Jonathan Powell, the European Commission president’s chief of cabinet Bjoern Seibert, Nato secretary general’s chief of staff Geoffrey van Leeuwen, and senior officials from France, Germany, Italy, and Finland.Europe to carry "Lion’s Share"While plans remain fluid, officials suggested European countries would bear the bulk of responsibility for forces deployed in Ukraine — a position echoed by US Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday. “The planning work continues,” one source said, adding that Washington is still “determining the scope of its role.”Trump has ruled out deploying US ground troops but signalled openness to other forms of military support, such as command-and-control oversight or US airpower. Options under consideration reportedly include supplying additional air defence systems, deploying fighter jets to enforce a no-fly zone, and placing US officers in charge of European contingents, according to Reuters.European leaders back deploymentFrench President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer have both endorsed the idea of a European-led peacekeeping force, while German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has expressed cautious support. However, Germany’s powerful soldiers’ union warned Thursday that Nato leaders must face the reality that tens of thousands of troops would be required for any long-term mission in Ukraine.Trump pushes for quick endThe US president has repeatedly pressed for a rapid end to what he has called “Europe’s war,” raising concerns in Kyiv and among allies that Washington might push for a settlement on Russia’s terms. Still, the flurry of military planning underscores the seriousness with which Western leaders are preparing for potential security guarantees, should a ceasefire or broader peace deal be reached.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
