ISRO Gaganyaan 2025: India’s first uncrewed G1 mission with Vyommitra set to launch in December

ISRO is preparing for the Gaganyaan G1 mission, an uncrewed test flight scheduled for December 2025, featuring the Vyommitra humanoid robot. This mission will validate critical technologies and safety protocols for future crewed flights. Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla's ISS experience will inform the mission, highlighting the importance of international collaboration and rigorous testing to ensure astronaut safety and mission success.

ISRO is preparing for the Gaganyaan G1 mission, an uncrewed test flight scheduled for December 2025, featuring the Vyommitra humanoid robot. This mission will validate critical technologies and safety protocols for future crewed flights. Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla's ISS experience will inform the mission, highlighting the importance of international collaboration and rigorous testing to ensure astronaut safety and mission success.  The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is set to achieve a major milestone with the launch of its first uncrewed Gaganyaan mission, G1, scheduled for December 2025. This mission represents a pivotal step in India’s ambitious human spaceflight programme, aiming to establish safe and reliable crewed space missions. Onboard, Vyommitra, a half-humanoid robot, will monitor and test critical spacecraft systems, including life support, avionics, and environmental controls, simulating human responses in microgravity. The data collected will help ISRO refine safety protocols and mission operations ahead of future crewed Gaganyaan flights. With G1, India moves closer to joining the elite group of nations capable of independent human space exploration, showcasing its growing expertise in space technology and robotics.Gaganyaan G1 December launch: Vyommitra to test spacecraft and life support systemsThe Gaganyaan programme, India’s flagship human spaceflight initiative, is designed to develop the capability to send Indian astronauts safely into low Earth orbit and bring them back. The upcoming G1 mission, scheduled for a December 2025 launch, will be the first uncrewed test flight, aimed at validating critical technologies such as life support systems, avionics, navigation, and safety protocols.Onboard, Vyommitra, the half-humanoid robot, will simulate human responses to microgravity, monitor spacecraft systems, and provide ISRO engineers with crucial data to enhance safety and operational efficiency. This mission is a vital step toward preparing for future crewed Gaganyaan flights, ensuring reliability and astronaut safety in India’s ambitious space programme.Key announcements and insights from ISRO leadershipISRO Chairman V. Narayanan, alongside Space Minister Jitendra Singh and astronaut Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, addressed the media to highlight the mission’s significance. Narayanan emphasized the importance of Shukla’s recent experience aboard the Axiom-4 mission to the ISS, noting that such operational knowledge will be critical for upcoming Gaganyaan missions.He also cautioned about inherent risks in crewed missions, referencing a liquid oxygen leak during Falcon-9’s Axiom-4 launch, which posed a potential hazard to astronaut safety. “Even a small crack combined with lift-off vibrations could lead to catastrophic failure,” Narayanan noted, underscoring the need for rigorous testing in the G1 uncrewed mission.Vyommitra: India’s half-humanoid space robotVyommitra is a pioneering development in India’s space robotics sector, designed to test human safety protocols and spacecraft performance under microgravity conditions. The robot will monitor environmental conditions inside the crew module, perform routine operations, and simulate astronaut responses, thereby helping ISRO mitigate risks before sending humans on board.This humanoid’s inclusion in Gaganyaan G1 ensures that critical life support systems, pressure controls, and avionics are thoroughly tested, providing a blueprint for safe and efficient crewed missions in the near future.Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla shares insights from Axiom-4 ISS missionGroup Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, India’s first astronaut aboard the Axiom-4 mission to the ISS, described his experience as a “mission of the entire nation.” He highlighted the differences between terrestrial training and real-time operations in space, emphasizing the unique insights gained from conducting seven experiments in microgravity, including stem cell studies and plant growth experiments.Shukla also stressed the importance of global collaboration in space exploration, noting that Crew Dragon, Russia’s Soyuz, and other vehicles collectively support human access to the ISS—a hub of international scientific cooperation since 2000.ISRO’s track record and achievementsThe upcoming Gaganyaan G1 mission builds upon decades of ISRO’s technological and scientific excellence. Chairman Narayanan highlighted contributions from 20,000 employees, 450 industrial partners, and 300 academic institutions, as well as achievements across multiple sectors, including:Telemedicine and tele-education initiativesReal-time communication for trains and shipping vesselsContributions to 13 out of 17 UN Sustainable Development GoalsAditya-L1 solar mission and NISAR Earth observation projectAdvancements in cryogenic engine technology and satellite launches, including a 6,500-kg US communication satelliteIndia has successfully launched 433 satellites from 34 countries, showcasing its growing expertise in space technology and international collaboration.Also Read | Hurricane Erin from the ISS: Stunning view as the Category 2 storm Threatens the Atlantic Coast | Watch video`About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.
