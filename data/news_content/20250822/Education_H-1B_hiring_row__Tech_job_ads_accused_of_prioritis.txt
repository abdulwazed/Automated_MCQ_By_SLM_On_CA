H-1B hiring row: Tech job ads accused of prioritising immigrants over US workers

Amid tech sector layoffs and evolving hiring practices, the H-1B visa program faces increased scrutiny. Companies are subtly rerouting job postings, allegedly limiting opportunities for US workers. Simultaneously, policy tightening and political rhetoric fuel a backlash against high-skilled immigration, creating uncertainty for foreign professionals and reshaping the workforce.

Amid tech sector layoffs and evolving hiring practices, the H-1B visa program faces increased scrutiny. Companies are subtly rerouting job postings, allegedly limiting opportunities for US workers. Simultaneously, policy tightening and political rhetoric fuel a backlash against high-skilled immigration, creating uncertainty for foreign professionals and reshaping the workforce.  In a season where silence speaks louder than policy, the fine print of job advertisements is drawing sharper lines than campaign rhetoric. A recent report has shed light on the changing contours of H-1B hiring in the US technology sector—where compliance, optics, and intent now perform an uneasy dance.According to Newsweek, companies such as OpenAI and Instacart placed job advertisements in the San Francisco Chronicle and other outlets to meet the Department of Labor’s requirement that green card–sponsored positions be publicly listed. However, instead of directing applicants to general recruitment teams, the ads routed them to immigration or “global mobility” departments.US federal rules require such roles to be posted across multiple channels: Two major Sunday newspapers, state workforce agency websites, internal company portals, and a platform of the employer’s choice. The report suggests that routing applications through immigration departments may limit visibility for US-born candidates, prompting scrutiny over whether the system is being fairly implemented.Layoffs and the fragility of the H-1B promiseThe H-1B visa system was once positioned as America’s wager on meritocracy—a tool to import global expertise into its innovation arteries. In practice, it has evolved into a pressure valve for a corporate sector addicted to cost arbitrage and cyclical churn. According to Crunchbase, over 95,000 US-based tech workers were laid off in 2024 alone, with another 4,500 roles eliminated in a single week of July 2025. This is no ordinary correction. It is a recalibration of labour itself—away from scalable human capital toward AI-automated efficiencies. Salesforce has frozen software engineer hiring; others have simply offloaded at scale.Caught in this shift are Indian H-1B holders, who accounted for 72.6% of approved H-1B petitions in FY 2022, according to data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Many of these professionals are employed by top sponsoring firms such as Amazon, Infosys, TCS, and Cognizant—companies that have been central players in the ongoing tech sector contraction. Bloomberg estimates that over 200,000 tech workers were laid off in the US between November 2022 and January 2023, with 30–40% of them believed to be Indian IT professionals. According to industry estimates, around 80,000 Indian nationals on H-1B and L-1 visas have lost their jobs since late 2022, many of whom face a 60-day grace period under US immigration rules to secure new sponsorship or leave the country.The new face of America’s skilled immigration backlashThe employment crisis coincides with a sharp tightening of US visa policy. As reported by AP News, the Trump administration has launched a sweeping review of over 55 million valid visa holders, aiming to identify security risks, overstays, or other violations. The vetting process includes monitoring social media and, in some cases, requiring visa applicants to unlock electronic devices during interviews. Over 6,000 student visas have already been revoked, and some worker visa categories, such as those for commercial truck drivers, have been paused.Compounding the policy shift is a rise in political hostility towards high-skilled immigration. Former Trump strategist Steve Bannon has publicly called for a moratorium on all foreign student visas. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has gone further, explicitly demanding a ban on Indian H-1B visa holders, arguing they displace American graduates. What once existed on the political fringe is now influencing mainstream legislative rhetoric, with the H-1B and OPT pipelines becoming focal points in the broader immigration debate.A system mid-pivotThe convergence of corporate hiring practices, mass layoffs, administrative crackdowns, and political rhetoric signals a period of heightened scrutiny for visa-linked employment in the US While companies continue to sponsor H-1B workers, even amid domestic layoffs, debate continues over whether the system is serving its original intent—or facilitating structural reshaping of the workforce.The immigration system was designed to be merit-driven, but merit, it seems, is no longer the only currency. In its place: risk optics, political resonance, and a narrowing bandwidth of institutional patience.And so, in the quiet rerouting of a job listing or the sudden freeze of a hiring pipeline, the larger signal emerges—not in outrage or legality, but in the quiet erosion of certainty.Ready to navigate global policies?
