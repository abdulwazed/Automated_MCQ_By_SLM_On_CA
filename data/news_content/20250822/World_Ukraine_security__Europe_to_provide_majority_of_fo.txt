Ukraine security: Europe to provide majority of forces; Trump leaves open possibility of US air support

Military leaders from the US and European allies are developing security guarantees for Ukraine, following Trump's pledge to help protect the nation as part of a settlement with Moscow. Discussions involve potential strategies, with Europe taking the lead in deployment and the US playing a supporting role. While Trump ruled out ground troops, he signaled openness to other military support.

Military leaders from the US and European allies are developing security guarantees for Ukraine, following Trump's pledge to help protect the nation as part of a settlement with Moscow. Discussions involve potential strategies, with Europe taking the lead in deployment and the US playing a supporting role. While Trump ruled out ground troops, he signaled openness to other military support.  Military leaders from the United States and key European allies have drawn up options for providing security guarantees to Ukraine, officials confirmed on Thursday, marking a significant step in ongoing efforts to end Russia’s nearly four-year war.According to a report from Reuters, the proposals were presented to national security advisers from both sides of the Atlantic after US President Donald Trump pledged to help protect Ukraine as part of any settlement with Moscow. A Pentagon statement said US and European planners had developed military options for “appropriate consideration,” following a Reuters report that first revealed the deliberations.Allies gather in WashingtonThe chiefs of defence from the US, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the UK, and Ukraine met in Washington between Tuesday and Thursday to hash out potential strategies. According to Reuters, sources said discussions focused on how Europe could take the lead in any deployment, with the US likely playing a supporting role.US secretary of state and national security Adviser Marco Rubio later held a conference call with his European counterparts, including UK national security adviser Jonathan Powell, the European Commission president’s chief of cabinet Bjoern Seibert, Nato secretary general’s chief of staff Geoffrey van Leeuwen, and senior officials from France, Germany, Italy, and Finland.Europe to carry "Lion’s Share"While plans remain fluid, officials suggested European countries would bear the bulk of responsibility for forces deployed in Ukraine — a position echoed by US Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday. “The planning work continues,” one source said, adding that Washington is still “determining the scope of its role.”Trump has ruled out deploying US ground troops but signalled openness to other forms of military support, such as command-and-control oversight or US airpower. Options under consideration reportedly include supplying additional air defence systems, deploying fighter jets to enforce a no-fly zone, and placing US officers in charge of European contingents, according to Reuters.European leaders back deploymentFrench President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer have both endorsed the idea of a European-led peacekeeping force, while German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has expressed cautious support. However, Germany’s powerful soldiers’ union warned Thursday that Nato leaders must face the reality that tens of thousands of troops would be required for any long-term mission in Ukraine.Trump pushes for quick endThe US president has repeatedly pressed for a rapid end to what he has called “Europe’s war,” raising concerns in Kyiv and among allies that Washington might push for a settlement on Russia’s terms. Still, the flurry of military planning underscores the seriousness with which Western leaders are preparing for potential security guarantees, should a ceasefire or broader peace deal be reached.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
