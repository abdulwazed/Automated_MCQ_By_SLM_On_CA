Early results show Surya can generate visual forecasts up to two hours in advance with greater accuracy than traditional methods. By making the model open-source, NASA hopes to enable global researchers to build on its capabilities, enhancing space weather defense worldwide.How AI helps scientists understand solar eruptions and protect Earth’s technologyWhen the Sun erupts, it releases bursts of charged particles and magnetic energy known as solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). These events create “space weather” that can travel across the solar system, disrupting satellites, power grids, GPS systems, and even astronaut safety on space missions.Solar weather predictions: A shield for satellites, power, astronauts, and trave: Satellite disruption: Solar storms can damage or disable satellites used for communication, navigation, and weather forecasting.Power grid failures: Strong geomagnetic storms can overload power infrastructure, causing widespread blackouts.Astronaut safety: Solar radiation poses a serious health risk to astronauts on the ISS and future missions to the Moon and Mars.Air travel and GPS: Aviation routes and GPS-based services can be interrupted, affecting global connectivity.Understanding and forecasting solar eruptions is therefore essential not just for scientists but for protecting modern life.Surya: NASA’s AI model for the SunThe Surya Heliophysics Foundational Model is NASA’s response to these growing challenges. Built with the help of IBM and research partners, Surya is an AI system trained specifically on solar physics.Unlike conventional forecasting methods that rely on limited models, Surya leverages machine learning to process massive datasets and detect subtle patterns in solar activity. This allows it to predict solar eruptions faster and more accurately than traditional approaches.Source: NASATraining AI on solar dynamics observatory data for better space weather forecastsSurya’s power lies in its training data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), a spacecraft launched in 2010 to study the Sun.High-resolution imagery: SDO captures images of the Sun every 12 seconds across multiple wavelengths, providing unmatched detail.Magnetic field mapping: The observatory records constant measurements of the Sun’s magnetic activity—key triggers of solar storms.15-year archive: With an unbroken record spanning an entire solar cycle, the dataset gives Surya a rare depth of consistency.This continuous monitoring enables Surya to recognize the earliest signs of instability on the Sun’s surface, helping it forecast eruptions before they occur.AI in solar forecasting: Faster and 16% more accurate resultsInitial tests show Surya outperforming traditional methods in predicting solar activity.Forecast lead time: Surya can produce visual forecasts up to two hours in advance.Accuracy boost: It improves predictive performance by about 16% compared to current models.Visual modeling: Surya generates dynamic visualizations that help scientists interpret predictions more effectively.Even short-term improvements matter. An extra hour of warning could give satellite operators time to protect spacecraft or allow power grid managers to adjust loads and prevent cascading failures.NASA makes AI model 'Surya' open-source for global space weather researchSource: NASANASA has chosen to make Surya publicly accessible to accelerate space weather research worldwide.Available on Hugging Face: Researchers can access the AI model directly for experimentation and forecasting.Code on GitHub: Developers and educators can adapt and expand its capabilities.This open-science approach ensures Surya’s benefits are shared globally, encouraging innovation across scientific and industrial fields.Surya’s development reflects collaboration between government, academia, and industry.National AI Research Resource (NAIRR): Provided by the National Science Foundation to supply the necessary computing infrastructure.NVIDIA and IBM: Industry partners offering hardware and expertise to optimize the model’s performance.By combining NASA’s deep space data with cutting-edge AI technology, Surya represents a fusion of science and computation that can be replicated in other domains of Earth and space science.The impact of space weather and AI forecasting on daily lifePredicting solar activity isn’t just about protecting satellites—it touches nearly every aspect of life on Earth.Defense and security: Military communications and surveillance systems depend on satellite functionality.Global economy: Stock markets, airlines, and internet services all rely on stable communication networks.Future space missions: As NASA prepares for lunar bases and eventual Mars missions, accurate radiation forecasts will be essential for astronaut survival.Just as meteorology transformed life on Earth by predicting storms and climate patterns, heliophysics is now moving toward real-time forecasting of the Sun’s moods.NASA’s vision for the futureNASA officials believe Surya marks the beginning of a new era in heliophysics.Kevin Murphy, NASA’s Chief Science Data Officer, highlighted the shift:“We are advancing data-driven science by embedding NASA’s deep scientific expertise into cutting-edge AI models. This empowers broader understanding of how solar activity impacts critical systems on Earth.”Joseph Westlake, Director of NASA’s Heliophysics Division, compared it to traditional weather forecasting:“Just as meteorology helps us predict Earth’s weather, space weather forecasting helps us protect astronauts, spacecraft, power grids, and GPS systems.

A 120-million-year-old Hyphalosaurus fossil, unearthed in China, reveals a rare case of axial bifurcation, resulting in a two-headed reptile. This remarkable find, published in Biology Letters, represents the oldest known instance of this congenital defect in the vertebrate fossil record. The discovery provides valuable insights into developmental anomalies and evolutionary challenges faced by ancient species. Source: Science Alert A remarkable fossil discovery dating back more than 120 million years has revealed the existence of a two-headed Hyphalosaurus, a small, long-necked aquatic reptile that lived during the Early Cretaceous period. Unearthed in the Yixian Formation of northeastern China, this unique specimen shows clear signs of axial bifurcation, a rare developmental anomaly in which an embryo begins to split into twins but fails to complete the process, resulting in a single organism with two heads.Although similar malformations have been observed in modern-day reptiles such as snakes, lizards, and turtles, this fossil is the oldest known example of such a condition in the vertebrate fossil record. The discovery, published in a 2007 study by Buffetaut and colleagues in Biology Letters, offers important insight into the occurrence of congenital defects in ancient species. It also provides a fascinating glimpse into the biological and evolutionary challenges faced by early reptiles, adding a rare developmental perspective to paleontology and evolutionary biology.Fossil discovery explains axial bifurcation in two-headed hyphalosaurusAxial bifurcation is a rare developmental anomaly that occurs during early embryonic growth, where the vertebral column begins to split longitudinally, resulting in two parallel cervical (neck) series and the formation of two distinct skulls and necks. This incomplete twinning process leads to the development of conjoined heads, a condition that is extremely uncommon in reptiles and other vertebrates. In modern species such as snakes and turtles, axial bifurcation is occasionally observed but usually results in non-viable or short-lived offspring due to complications in mobility, feeding, or organ function.The two-headed Hyphalosaurus fossil discovered in the Yixian Formation provides the earliest known evidence of this phenomenon in the fossil record. Measuring just 70 millimeters in length, the specimen is believed to be either a late-stage embryo or a newborn that did not survive beyond hatching. Despite its brief lifespan, the fossil’s exceptional preservation offers scientists a rare window into congenital malformations in ancient reptiles. It not only demonstrates that such developmental errors occurred as far back as the Early Cretaceous but also opens new avenues for understanding the evolutionary and genetic factors influencing vertebrate development in deep time.Significance of the two-headed hyphalosaurus fossil discoveryThe preservation of this two-headed Hyphalosaurus fossil is an extraordinary stroke of luck, considering that the fossil record captures only a minute fraction of all organisms that once lived. Developmental anomalies like axial bifurcation are rare to begin with, and their fossilization is even more unlikely. What makes this discovery even more remarkable is the specimen’s nearly pristine condition.The fossil remains partially embedded in sediment, and the surrounding stone slab is unbroken, lending strong support to its authenticity, a crucial point given the region's history of fossil forgeries.According to the original 2007 study published in Biology Letters, this fossil represents the oldest confirmed case of axial bifurcation in any vertebrate. Its discovery not only sheds light on rare congenital conditions in ancient reptiles but also expands our understanding of how such anomalies have occurred throughout evolutionary history. It serves as a rare and valuable reference point for studying embryonic development, mutation, and survivability in extinct species.The Hyphalosaurus fossil discovery underscores the rarity of axial bifurcation and the value of well-preserved specimens in studying prehistoric life. While modern examples of two-headed reptiles exist, this dinosaur-age fossil offers a unique glimpse into evolutionary development and the challenges of survival for such anomalies. It highlights how rare and complex such conditions are in nature, providing scientists with crucial insights into developmental biology, genetic mutations, and how these factors may have impacted the behavior and longevity of ancient species.By examining fossils like this, scientists gain deeper insight into the diversity and complexity of life millions of years ago, emphasizing the continuing importance of paleontology in uncovering nature’s ancient mysteries.Also read| 26-million-year-old whale skull fossil found, sheds light on ancient marine lifeAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Mercury’s radius is shrinking rapidly! Smallest planet in solar system loses 11 kilometres since formation; scientists warn

Recent research indicates Mercury is shrinking, with its radius decreasing by 2.7 to 5.6 kilometers due to core cooling. This contraction forms thrust faults and scarps on the surface. A new measurement method focusing on major faults provides a more accurate understanding of Mercury's geological history, revealing insights into planetary evolution.

Recent research indicates Mercury is shrinking, with its radius decreasing by 2.7 to 5.6 kilometers due to core cooling. This contraction forms thrust faults and scarps on the surface. A new measurement method focusing on major faults provides a more accurate understanding of Mercury's geological history, revealing insights into planetary evolution.  Mercury, the smallest planet in our solar system, has captivated scientists due to its extreme temperatures, dense iron-rich core, magnetic field, and distinctive geological features. Recent research reveals that Mercury is gradually shrinking over time, a process driven by the cooling and contraction of its deep interior layers. As the planet’s core loses heat, the rigid outer crust adjusts, forming thrust faults, ridges, and cliff-like scarps visible across the surface. New measurement techniques using spacecraft data indicate that Mercury’s radius has decreased by 2.7 to 5.6 kilometres, providing the most precise estimate to date. These groundbreaking findings offer crucial insights into Mercury’s tectonic activity, internal dynamics, planetary contraction, and long-term geological evolution, enhancing our broader understanding of how small rocky planets form, stabilize, and change over billions of years.Understanding Mercury’s shrinking radius: How the smallest planet in our solar system continues contractingRecent research shows that Mercury’s radius has decreased by 2.7 to 5.6 kilometres. This is a refinement from earlier estimates of 1 to 7 kilometres, which had wide margins of error.The shrinkage is primarily due to cooling within Mercury’s interior. As the planet loses heat over billions of years, the core contracts slightly. Since the crust sits on top of this cooling, shrinking core, it must also adjust, causing the surface to compress. This adjustment forms thrust faults—areas where the crust is pushed together—and produces steep, cliff-like features known as scarps, some stretching hundreds of kilometres long.Previously, scientists estimated shrinkage indirectly by measuring the size of these surface faults. However, because fault heights and lengths can vary and overlap, the earlier estimates were imprecise. The new research provides a more direct and accurate method of calculating how much Mercury has contracted.New method tracks Mercury’s shrinking radius accuratelyPlanetary geologists Stephan R. Loveless and Christian Klimczak introduced a novel approach to measure Mercury’s shrinkage. Instead of averaging all faults, they focused on the largest, most representative faults from three extensive datasets. These datasets ranged from 100 faults to nearly 6,000 faults, covering the planet’s surface comprehensively.All datasets consistently indicated that 2 to 3.5 kilometres of contraction occurred due to faulting alone. When additional cooling processes of Mercury’s mantle and core are considered, the total contraction reaches 5.6 kilometres. This method reduces uncertainty and provides a clearer, more precise understanding of Mercury’s geological history.Why Mercury shrinks faster than other planetsMercury’s iron-rich core loses heat more quickly than Earth’s, which explains why the planet contracts faster. As the core cools and shrinks, the rigid outer crust is forced to adapt to the smaller volume beneath it. Over billions of years, this process has reduced Mercury’s total diameter by approximately 11 kilometres since its formation.The contrast with Earth is significant. Earth retains more internal heat due to its larger size and tectonic activity, so its contraction is far slower. Mercury, being smaller and lacking active plate tectonics, shows the effects of core cooling much more visibly on its surface.Mercury’s thrust faults and scarps reveal planetary contraction and coolingMercury’s thrust faults and cliff-like scarps are direct evidence of planetary contraction. These formations occur where sections of the crust are pushed together, often producing dramatic features that rise several kilometres above surrounding terrain.By mapping and analyzing these structures, scientists can trace Mercury’s contraction over time. The distribution and orientation of faults also reveal how the interior cooled unevenly, causing localized stress and deformation. These surface features act as a natural record of the planet’s cooling history.Studying Mercury’s contraction offers insights beyond just one planet. The methods used in this research could be applied to other rocky planets like Mars or exoplanets, helping scientists understand their tectonics, cooling rates, and geological evolution.Understanding Mercury also improves models of planetary formation and evolution. By observing how heat loss affects a planet’s structure, researchers can better predict the long-term dynamics of terrestrial worlds, including those that could potentially support life.Also Read | NASA alert!

Nasa alert! Stadium-sized asteroid 1997 QK1 set for close flyby of Earth on August 20 at 22,000 mph

A massive asteroid, 1997 QK1, is set to safely pass Earth on August 20, 2025, at a distance of 1.87 million miles. While not a threat, this flyby offers NASA and ISRO a valuable opportunity to study near-Earth objects. This event allows scientists to refine orbital models, assess asteroid composition, and improve planetary defense strategies.

A massive asteroid, 1997 QK1, is set to safely pass Earth on August 20, 2025, at a distance of 1.87 million miles. While not a threat, this flyby offers NASA and ISRO a valuable opportunity to study near-Earth objects. This event allows scientists to refine orbital models, assess asteroid composition, and improve planetary defense strategies.  Asteroids have long fascinated scientists and the public alike, serving as reminders of both the beauty and unpredictability of our universe. These rocky remnants from the solar system’s formation often pass through Earth’s neighborhood, sometimes sparking excitement and curiosity when they come unusually close. While most of these flybys are harmless, they provide valuable opportunities for researchers to study asteroid behavior, refine orbital models, and improve planetary defense systems. NASA, along with other global space agencies, closely monitors such events to ensure Earth’s safety and to expand our understanding of near-Earth objects. One such asteroid making headlines now is 1997 QK1, a massive space rock expected to pass Earth on August 20, 2025, during a safe but significant flyby.NASA confirms asteroid 1997 QK1 will pass Earth on August 20: Size and distanceAsteroid 1997 QK1 was first detected in the late 1990s and has been tracked ever since. It belongs to the Aten group of near-Earth asteroids, named after the Egyptian sun god Aten. These asteroids are unique because their orbits cross Earth’s path around the Sun, making them frequent candidates for close encounters. This asteroid’s large size makes it particularly notable. To put its dimensions into perspective:It is longer than three football fields lined up. If it ever struck Earth, it could cause regional devastation, though not global extinction like the asteroid linked to the dinosaurs’ demise.Fortunately, its trajectory ensures it will remain safely distant during this flyby.On August 20, the asteroid will pass within 1.87 million miles (3 million kilometers) of Earth. While this may sound vast, in astronomical terms it qualifies as a close approach. For comparison:The Moon orbits Earth at about 238,855 miles (384,400 km).This asteroid will pass roughly eight times farther than the Moon’s distance.Though distant in human terms, space agencies classify such encounters as significant because they allow researchers to refine orbital predictions and study asteroid behavior more closely.Why Asteroid 1997 QK1 is not a threatAsteroids are classified as Potentially Hazardous Objects (PHOs) if they meet two conditions:They are larger than 140 meters (460 feet).They come within 4.6 million miles (7.4 million km) of Earth.Asteroid 1997 QK1 meets both criteria, but “potentially hazardous” does not mean “imminently dangerous.” Instead, it signals that its path deserves careful tracking and monitoring by astronomers worldwide. NASA’s precise calculations confirm that this flyby is safe, with no risk of impact now or in the near future, and continuous observations ensure early warning of any unexpected trajectory changes.Why NASA and global space agencies track asteroidsAsteroid monitoring is a cornerstone of planetary defense. Even small changes in an asteroid’s orbit—caused by gravitational nudges from planets or effects like the Yarkovsky effect (when sunlight heats one side of an asteroid, slowly altering its trajectory)—can shift its long-term path.By observing asteroids like 1997 QK1, scientists aim to:Improve orbital models to predict future movements.Assess their composition, density, and spin rate.Explore strategies for deflection missions if a dangerous asteroid is discovered in the future.Notably, NASA’s DART mission (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) in 2022 demonstrated the possibility of altering an asteroid’s orbit by deliberately crashing a spacecraft into it—an important milestone in planetary defense.India’s ISRO plans future missions to study near-Earth asteroidsThe interest in asteroids is not limited to NASA. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has outlined plans for participation in global asteroid studies. According to ISRO Chairman S. Somanath, future missions may include research on larger near-Earth objects, especially as the world prepares for the highly anticipated close approach of asteroid Apophis in 2029.International collaborations involving NASA, ESA (European Space Agency), and JAXA (Japan) are essential, as planetary defense requires shared data and joint strategies. By pooling resources and expertise, space agencies ensure Earth is better prepared for cosmic encounters.Why asteroid 1997 QK1’s flyby is a scientific opportunity for NASA and ISROThe flyby of 1997 QK1 is more than a cosmic spectacle—it is a scientific opportunity. Studying such objects helps researchers uncover:Clues about the solar system’s formation, since asteroids are primitive building blocks of planets.Insights into their structural integrity, important for future resource mining or deflection missions.Better risk assessment models, ensuring preparedness for genuine threats.Although harmless, this event underscores the importance of constant vigilance. The universe is filled with millions of space rocks, and only careful monitoring can separate harmless visitors from those that could alter life on Earth.Also Read | NASA intern Thad Roberts stole $21 million in moon rocks from Johnson Space Center for love; shocked the worldAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Astronaut Subhanshu Shukla, along with astronaut Prashant Balakrishnan Nair, receives grand welcome from Union space minister Jitendra Singh, Delhi CM Rekha Gupta and and Isro chairman V Narayanan at the Delhi airport NEW DELHI: Following his historic mission to the International Space Station (ISS), Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla received a red-carpet welcome at Delhi’s IGI airport as he returned to the country from the US in the early hours of Sunday. Shukla, who piloted the spacecraft to the space station as part of the Axiom-4 mission, was welcomed by Union space minister Jitendra Singh, Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta and Isro chairman V Narayanan, and a large crowd of space enthusiasts at the airport.Posting on X later, minister Jitendra Singh said, “A moment of pride for India! A moment of glory for #ISRO! A moment of gratitude to the dispensation that facilitated this under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. India’s Space glory touches the Indian soil… as the iconic son of Mother India, Gaganyatri Shubhanshu Shukla lands at Delhi in the early hours of morning today. Accompanying him, another equally accomplished Group Captain Prasanth Balakrishnan Nair, one of the astronauts selected for India’s first Human mission Gaganyaan who was India’s designated backup for the mission to the ISS. Privileged to receive both of them”.Shukla is expected to meet PM Modi and then travel to his hometown Lucknow. He is likely to return to the Capital on Aug 22–23 to participate in the National Space Day celebrations.PollShould the Indian government invest more in space exploration?DefinitelyNo, we need to focus on other issuesThe Lok Sabha will hold a special discussion on Monday on India's space journey and Shukla's historic mission aboard the ISS, according to a notice issued by the lower House. The House will discuss “India's first astronaut aboard the ISS — critical role of space programme for Viksit Bharat by 2047”, which could possibly end the deadlock between the govt and opposition in Parliament over the electoral roll revision in Bihar.Earlier on Saturday, Shukla had posted a smiling photograph of himself on a flight and said he was filled with emotions. “As I sit on the plane to come back to India, I have a mix of emotions running through my heart. I feel sad leaving a fantastic group of people behind who were my friends and family for the past one year during this mission. I am also excited about meeting all my friends, family, and everyone in the country for the first time post mission.

For some patients, the 'inner voice' may soon be audible

Scientists have achieved a significant breakthrough in decoding inner speech, offering hope for individuals with speech impairments. Researchers successfully translated imagined words into text using brain implants and AI. The study, part of the BrainGate2 trial, demonstrated that brain signals for imagined speech are similar to those for attempted speech.

Scientists have achieved a significant breakthrough in decoding inner speech, offering hope for individuals with speech impairments. Researchers successfully translated imagined words into text using brain implants and AI. The study, part of the BrainGate2 trial, demonstrated that brain signals for imagined speech are similar to those for attempted speech.  For decades, neuro-engineers have dreamed of helping people who have been cut off from the world of language. A disease like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, weakens the muscles in the airway. A stroke can kill neurons that normally relay commands for speaking. Perhaps, by implanting electrodes, scientists could record the brain's electric activity and translate that into spoken words.Now a team of researchers has made an important advance toward that goal. Previously they succeeded in decoding the signals produced when people tried to speak. In the new study, published Thursday in the journal Cell, their computer often made correct guesses when the subjects simply imagined saying words.Christian Herff, a neuroscientist at Maastricht University in the Netherlands who was not involved in the research, said the result went beyond the merely technological and shed light on the mystery of language. "It's a fantastic advance," Herff said. The new study is the latest result in a long-running clinical trial, called BrainGate2, that has already seen some remarkable successes.One participant, Casey Harrell, now uses his brain-machine interface to hold conversations. In 2023, after ALS had made his voice unintelligible, Harrell agreed to have electrodes implanted in his brain. A computer recorded the electrical activity from the implants as Harrell attempted to say different words. Over time, with the help of AI, the computer predicted 6,000 words, with 97.5% accuracy.But successes like this raised a troubling question: Could a computer accidentally record more than patients actually wanted to say?Could it eavesdrop on their inner voice? "We wanted to investigate if there was a risk of the system decoding words that weren't meant to be said aloud," said Erin Kunz, a neuroscientist at Stanford University and an author of the study. She and her colleagues also wondered if patients might actually prefer using inner speech.Kunz and her colleagues decided to investigate the mystery for themselves. The scientists gave participants seven different words, including "kite" and "day," then compared the brain signals when participants attempted to say the words and when they only imagined saying them.As it turned out, imagining a word produced a pattern of activity similar to that of trying to say it, but the signal was weaker. The computer did a good job of predicting which of the seven words the participants were thinking. For Harrell, it didn't do much better than a random guess would have, but for another participant it picked the right word more than 70% of the time.The researchers put the computer through more training, this time specifically on inner speech. Its performance improved significantly, including on Harrell. Now when the participants imagined saying entire sentences, such as "I don't know how long you've been here," the computer could accurately decode most of the words.Herff, who has done his own studies, was surprised that the experiment succeeded. Before, he would have said that inner speech is fundamentally different from the motor cortex signals that produce actual speech. "But in this study, they show that, for some people, it isn't that different," he said.Kunz emphasized that the computer's current performance involving inner speech would not be good enough to let people hold conversations. "The results are an initial proof of concept more than anything," she said. But she is optimistic that decoding inner speech could become the new standard for brain-computer interfaces. In recent trials, she and her colleagues have improved the computer's accuracy. "We haven't hit the ceiling yet," she said. NYT
