NEW DELHI: A cloudburst in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kathua district has left at least seven people dead and several others injured, triggering landslides, flash floods and large-scale disruption. The incident, which occurred late Saturday night in Jodh Ghati village, washed away roads, damaged homes, and forced authorities into urgent rescue and relief operations.Train services along the vital Jammu-Pathankot line have also been suspended as rising water levels crossed danger marks on a key railway bridge. Helicopter evacuations have been launched, while multiple agencies including the Army, NDRF, SDRF and police are on the ground to restore connectivity and assist victims.Here are the top developments:Death toll rises to seven in KathuaOfficials confirmed that seven people have died in two separate incidents of cloudburst and landslide in Kathua. Five casualties occurred in Jodh Ghati following flash floods triggered by the overnight downpour, while two more died after a landslide in Janglote.Jammu Divisional Commissioner Ramesh Kumar said, “There was heavy rain in Kathua since last night... Seven people have died due to the landslide. Rescue operations are ongoing... Those who died due to the landslide, their bodies have been retrieved.” Rescue teams are still combing through debris and flood-hit areas amid fears of more missing persons. Helicopters were pressed into service due to washed-away roads and villages cut off from access.Train traffic disrupted on Jammu-Pathankot lineRail connectivity has been badly affected with the suspension of up-line train movement between Kathua and Budhi. Senior Divisional Commercial Manager, Jammu Railway Division, Uchit Singhal, said: “Due to heavy rains, water is flowing above the danger level through bridge number 43 between Kathua-Budhi. In view of this, temporarily till the water level subsides, up-line movement has been suspended, and in the meantime, up trains are being moved via a temporary single line through the down line track.” Villages cut off after flash floods and landslidesThe cloudburst snapped access to Jodh Ghati village, where floodwaters swept through homes and agricultural fields, leaving families stranded. Several connecting roads were washed away, and a bridge collapsed, worsening the situation. Deputy Commissioner Kathua Rajesh Sharma confirmed that rescue operations are underway and that stranded people are being shifted to safer areas. Local police reported that a station building in Kathua had also been damaged. Rescue operations led by Army and NDRFThe Indian Army, NDRF, SDRF, police and BRO have been deployed in full strength across Kathua. Heavy machinery has been brought in to fragment massive boulders that rolled down into residential areas. Inspector General of Police, Jammu Zone, Bhim Sen Tuti, said, “Boulders had fallen here which needed to be fragmented... Heavy machinery has been called for that. With the help of BRO, they are being fragmented here. These boulders are being removed by using explosives wherever needed, and bodies have been recovered from beneath them.”Helicopter evacuation for injured victimsUnion minister Jitendra Singh confirmed that helicopter services were arranged to shift injured people to nearby hospitals. In his social media post, Singh wrote, “Helicopter services have been arranged for shifting the injured to appropriate hospitals. 6 injured have been airlifted for hospitalisation in Mamoon, Pathankot, which was found to be relatively nearer destination.” DIG Police Shiv Kumar Sharma and his team are camping at the site and coordinating airlifts. Centre closely monitoring situation, says Amit ShahUnion home minister Amit Shah assured full support from the Central government. In a post on X, Shah wrote, “Spoke with the Lieutenant Governor and Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir regarding the cloudburst in Kathua. Relief and rescue operations are being carried out by the local administration, and NDRF teams have also been rushed to the site. Assured every support from the Modi government. We stand firmly behind our sisters and brothers of J&K.” LG Manoj Sinha calls tragedy 'mind-numbing'Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha expressed grief over the loss of lives. In his message on X, he wrote: “Deeply anguished by the loss of lives in the devastating rain-triggered landslides in several areas of Kathua. The tragedy is mind-numbing. Briefed Hon’ble Union Home Minister Sh. Amit Shah Ji on rescue and relief operations by the army, NDRF, SDRF, police & administration.” CM Omar Abdullah announces ex-gratia reliefChief minister Omar Abdullah conveyed condolences and directed immediate assistance for affected families. A statement from his office said Rs 2 lakh would be given for each deceased, Rs 1 lakh for severely injured, and Rs 50,000 for those with minor injuries. Compensation has also been announced for damaged homes: Rs 1 lakh for fully damaged houses, Rs 50,000 for severely damaged houses, and Rs 25,000 for partially damaged houses. “The Chief Minister has directed the administration to carry out immediate relief, rescue and evacuation measures to ensure the safety and support of affected families,” the statement said.Repeated cloudburst disasters in J&KThe Kathua disaster comes just three days after a cloudburst in Kishtwar’s Chisoti village killed 60 people and injured over 100. Experts warn that frequent extreme weather in J&K is linked to changing rainfall patterns and climate pressures in the Himalayan region. Officials say the back-to-back incidents highlight the need for stronger disaster preparedness and better drainage infrastructure. While the state government has sought central assistance, locals in Kathua have urged long-term flood protection measures. This includes improved embankments, real-time weather alerts, and a review of building norms in vulnerable areas.Connectivity and services slowly being restoredAuthorities are now focused on restoring essential services, including power, water and road links. In Kishtwar, where floods occurred earlier, officials said blasting of boulders was undertaken to clear blocked roads. Rope bridges are being built to reconnect cut-off villages in Kathua. “The power supply and water supply have been restored. A bridge is being built here with the help of the Army... All the passengers stranded in Machail were safely evacuated yesterday,” said Divisional Commissioner Ramesh Kumar.
