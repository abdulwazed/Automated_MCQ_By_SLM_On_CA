Pahwa clarifies that a scene depicting imprisonment is purely fictional and unrelated to Aryan's past experiences.  Aryan Khan is stepping into the spotlight not just as Shah Rukh Khan’s son, but as a young filmmaker determined to make his own mark. Veteran actor Manoj Pahwa, who shared the screen with SRK in Josh (2000), calls Aryan the “spitting image” of his father, in looks, voice, and work ethic.In a chat with The Print, Pahwa said, “Aryan is following in his father’s footsteps. He (Aryan) is a hardcore professional, a workaholic, and he works very hard just like SRK.” Stars hail Aryan Khan for 'Ba***ds of Bollywood'| Preview sparks rave reviewsNow, with his directorial debut ‘The Ba***ds of Bollywood’ premiering on OTT from 18 September, Aryan is proving that talent and dedication run in the family.Pahwa highlights Aryan’s high expectations and focusManoj Pahwa emphasised that Aryan knew the pressure he carried, given his father’s legendary status. “And I am glad Aryan didn’t take it lightly. He has put in every bit of effort in bringing this project to life,” he said. The actor sees a reflection of SRK’s commitment in Aryan’s work. It’s not just ambition but a genuine love for filmmaking that pushes the young director to give his best at every stage.Actor impressed by Aryan’s creative character visionIn the show, Pahwa plays the protagonist’s uncle, an aspiring actor who hasn’t found success in Bollywood. While supporting his nephew in the glitzy world of films, he also struggles with envy.Pahwa explained, “When I first met Aryan and heard about the character and storyline, the experience was far beyond what I had anticipated. It was his first project. He is a young lad. I didn’t expect that the narrations would be pitch-perfect. I was blown away in that first meeting itself.” Aryan’s perfectionism is visible during multiple retakesWorking on set with Aryan was a refreshing experience, says Pahwa. He admired Aryan’s insistence on multiple retakes to get every shot just right. “He is new to the field but he doesn’t get satisfied easily. He would take multiple retakes until he was happy. I would call him a perfectionist,” he said.Although repeated takes occasionally caused slight irritation, the final results made it worth the effort. “But, when we see the results, it’s all worth it.”Clarification that show scenes not linked to incidentA scene from the preview showed the protagonist behind bars, with a cop telling him not to worry because people become more famous after being imprisoned. Some fans speculated it referenced Aryan’s 2021 wrongful arrest in a drugs case. Pahwa has now clarified, “There is no relation between the scene and the incident.” He stressed that ‘The Ba***ds of Bollywood’ is purely fictional and not tied to real-life events.About ‘The Ba***ds of Bollywood’Alongside Pahwa, ‘The Ba***ds of Bollywood’ features Lakshay, Raghav Juyal, Mona Singh, Manish Chaudhari, Anya Singh, Vijayant Kohli, and Gautami Kapoor.
