A ‘spot’ of hope: Chital returns to Faridabad Aravalis



A ‘spot’ of hope: Chital returns to Faridabad AravalisIpsita Pati /  Aug 22, 2025, 03:07 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLarge  Gurgaon: A spotted deer — or chital — with its distinctive russet-brown coat and white spots, was observed near Badkhal lake in the Faridabad Aravalis by forest department officials on Thursday. This sighting is believed to be the first recorded appearance of this species in the district, sparking hope and excitement within the wildlife community.Historically, the chital roamed freely across the Aravalis, stretching from Gurgaon to the Delhi Ridge. However, the rapid urbanisation of the 1980s and 1990s — fuelled by mining, real estate expansion, and deforestation — fragmented their habitats, pushing them into core forest zones like the Asola-Bhatti wildlife sanctuary. A 2017 Wildlife Institute of India (WII) survey of Haryana's Aravalis reported a significant decline in wildlife population, including that of the spotted deer, due to habitat loss and fragmentation.According to officials, this is the first confirmed sighting of a spotted deer in the Aravalis in recent records. Vivek Saxena, principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife), said, "We do not have data on the last sighting of chital in the Aravalis, but this sighting definitely shows that habitat improvements helped wildlife return to the region."You Can Also Check: Gurgaon AQI | Weather in Gurgaon | Bank Holidays in Gurgaon | Public Holidays in Gurgaon | Gold Rates Today in Gurgaon | Silver Rates Today in GurgaonThe sighting underscores the significance of green spaces at the urban fringe. Badkhal lake is situated at the edge of the Southern Aravali Ridge, which connects to the larger Delhi Ridge ecology and links with areas like the Asola-Bhatti sanctuary, an essential corridor for wildlife in this region."Wildlife, when given undisturbed green spaces, sometimes ventures back into areas we might consider too crowded. This visit could indicate that the wildlife corridor is active or that native habitat is gradually reclaiming ground. Either way, it serves as a subtle reminder of the broader environmental threads still weaving through our daily lives," said wildlife biologist Sumit Dookia.If sightings like this become more frequent, experts suggested it could be time to consider restoring or strengthening habitat links, including corridors between Asola and Sarika, where the spotted deer population is currently active."Seeing a spotted deer in Faridabad is a positive sign. It shows that even small patches of forest and wetlands can support wildlife if they are protected. What's crucial now is to ensure these green spaces remain connected so animals can move safely across the Aravalis," said wildlife expert Sunil Harsana.
