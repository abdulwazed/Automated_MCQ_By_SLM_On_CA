Hurricane Erin from the ISS: Stunning view as the Category 2 storm threatens the Atlantic Coast | Watch video

Hurricane Erin is a Category 2 storm in the Atlantic. It churns away from the US East Coast. The storm generates rip currents and coastal flooding. Astronauts on the International Space Station captured the storm. Warnings are issued from North Carolina to New York. The storm will bring rain and winds to Canada.

Hurricane Erin is a Category 2 storm in the Atlantic. It churns away from the US East Coast. The storm generates rip currents and coastal flooding. Astronauts on the International Space Station captured the storm. Warnings are issued from North Carolina to New York. The storm will bring rain and winds to Canada. Source: X Hurricane Erin has developed into a powerful storm system in the Atlantic Ocean, now showcased in remarkable detail through satellite and International Space Station imagery. With sustained winds reaching 100 mph, Erin holds the strength of a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, making it a serious threat to coastal regions. Although the system is shifting northeastward, its outer bands continue to bring life-threatening rip currents, dangerous surf, and coastal flooding. Authorities warn residents from North Carolina’s Outer Banks to New York’s waterfront communities to remain vigilant. Beaches have been closed, flood advisories are active, and emergency officials urge caution, as the storm’s impact extends well beyond its center, highlighting the ongoing risks along the East Coast.Hurricane Erin captured from the International Space StationAs reported by the USA Today, one of the most striking perspectives of Erin came from the International Space Station (ISS). Astronauts aboard the ISS recorded breathtaking video footage showing the storm’s eye and spiral cloud bands, offering a rare vantage point of nature’s raw power.From orbit, Erin’s rotation, dense cloud cover, and massive storm system were clearly visible, highlighting its intensity as it traveled northeast at 18 mph. Such satellite and ISS imagery is more than just visually dramatic—it provides critical forecasting data for meteorologists tracking Erin’s movement and predicting its potential impact on coastal communities.According to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), Erin was positioned about 285 miles east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, as of 2 pm ET. The storm is sustaining winds of 100 mph with higher gusts.While forecasters expect Erin to gradually weaken into a post-tropical cyclone by August 23, its outer rain bands, storm surge, and high surf continue to disrupt life along the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast coasts.Warnings and advisories across the Atlantic CoastNorth Carolina: Outer banks on high alertThe Outer Banks of North Carolina experienced the closest brush with Hurricane Erin. Tropical storm warnings and storm-surge alerts were issued, with coastal flooding expected to peak during high tide on August 21. Emergency officials advised residents to stay indoors and avoid flood-prone areas.New Jersey: Beaches closed and water activities bannedNew Jersey authorities prohibited swimming, surfing, and boating until at least August 22, citing life-threatening rip currents and dangerous surf conditions. Local lifeguards and emergency services remain vigilant as waves pound the shoreline.New York City: Flooding risks across five boroughsIn New York City, officials issued coastal flood advisories for all five boroughs. Flooding between 1 and 2.5 feet is projected during high tide from August 21 to August 22, with neighborhoods in southern Queens, Brooklyn’s waterfront, Staten Island, Manhattan, and the Bronx most at risk.Officials warned that rising waters could impact homes, businesses, and key roadways, potentially causing significant disruptions.Erin’s impacts extend to Canada: Heavy rain, strong winds, and coastal disruptions expectedAs reported by USA Today, though Erin will weaken over the coming days, its aftereffects won’t stop at the US coastline. The storm is forecast to bring heavy rainfall, strong winds, and turbulent seas as far north as southeastern Canada, impacting parts of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.Communities are urged to prepare for localized flooding, possible power outages, and travel delays as Erin continues its track across the Atlantic.Preparing for Hurricanes: Safety and insurance guidelinesThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) stresses the importance of early preparation during hurricane season. Even when a storm shifts direction, delaying precautions can be costly. Below are key safety and preparedness steps recommended by experts:Develop an evacuation planHouseholds in at-risk zones should map out evacuation routes, designate meeting points, and include an out-of-town contact in case relocation becomes necessary.Assemble disaster suppliesPreparedness kits should contain nonperishable food, bottled water, medications, batteries, flashlights, important documents, and first-aid supplies sufficient for several days.Review your insurance coverageMany homeowners don’t realize that standard insurance policies exclude flood damage. Flood insurance is available through private providers or the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) but carries a 30-day waiting period before coverage begins. Acting early is crucial.Create a family communication planDocument a family communication strategy, including emergency contacts, safe meeting places, and instructions for regrouping if members are separated.Strengthen and secure your homeTo reduce storm damage, residents should trim overhanging trees, install storm shutters, reinforce windows, seal wall openings, and fortify roofs against hurricane-force winds.Also Read | NASA and IBM create ‘Surya’: Advanced AI for predicting solar storms and strengthening space defenceAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.
