Billionaire Bill Ackman backs AI-powered Alpha School in the US: Can two hours of digital tutoring replace the traditional classroom?

Bill Ackman supports Alpha School, which uses AI for personalized learning. Alpha replaces traditional lectures with two hours of AI tutoring. Students spend four hours on life skills. There is no homework. A new campus is opening in New York. Alpha aims to make its model accessible through charter schools. The model focuses on preparing children for the future.

Bill Ackman supports Alpha School, which uses AI for personalized learning. Alpha replaces traditional lectures with two hours of AI tutoring. Students spend four hours on life skills. There is no homework. A new campus is opening in New York. Alpha aims to make its model accessible through charter schools. The model focuses on preparing children for the future. Billionaire Bill Ackman backs AI-powered Alpha School in the US For over two centuries, education has largely looked the same: a teacher at the front, students in rows, and a long school day packed with lectures, note-taking, and homework. Beyond replacing blackboards with whiteboards and integrating some technology, the structure of K–12 schooling hasn’t fundamentally changed. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman believes that is about to shift—and the catalyst is artificial intelligence.Ackman recently endorsed Alpha School in a post on X (formerly Twitter), calling it “the first truly breakthrough innovation in K–12 education that I have seen since the KIPP Academy.” The Austin-based private school claims to have cracked the code for 21st-century learning with a bold promise: two hours of personalised digital tutoring per day instead of traditional classroom lectures, no homework, and four hours dedicated to leadership and life skills development.Inside Alpha’s radical modelAlpha’s school day flips the conventional approach on its head. Instead of spending six to eight hours moving from subject to subject in a classroom setting, students spend just two hours with an AI-powered personal tutor that adapts lessons to their pace, strengths, and weaknesses.The remaining four hours are dedicated to developing soft skills, like public speaking, critical thinking, collaboration, and emotional resilience—areas traditional curricula often sideline. The school also offers parents real-time data on student progress, eliminating the guesswork around performance.In his X post, Ackman wrote, “200 years ago K–12 ed was a teacher and a blackboard in front of 25-30 kids. Today, the only thing that has changed is that the blackboard may be a whiteboard. And meanwhile the world is in the midst of an AI revolution.”Can two hours really replace eight?The most striking, and controversial, aspect of Alpha’s model is the compressed academic schedule. The assumption is that AI-driven, highly personalised instruction can deliver the same or better outcomes in far less time.Research on adaptive learning systems suggests this might not be far-fetched. Studies show students using intelligent tutoring systems can achieve mastery more quickly than those in traditional classrooms. By focusing only on what each student needs, AI tutors eliminate the inefficiencies of one-size-fits-all teaching.Still, education is more than academics. Critics argue that reducing classroom hours risks diminishing opportunities for social interaction, peer learning, and teacher mentorship—critical components of child development. Alpha attempts to address this through its life-skills programming, but whether that balance works remains to be seen.Homework is out, engagement is inAlpha has also abolished homework, believing that learning shouldn’t consume family evenings. Instead, students are encouraged to pursue hobbies, sports, and family time after school. Advocates say this approach reduces stress and fosters intrinsic motivation, while skeptics worry it could leave students underprepared for rigorous higher education environments.Scaling the experimentFor now, Alpha operates as a private school, but expansion plans are underway. A new New York City campus opens this September, and the company has announced intentions to launch charter schools to make its model more widely accessible.If Alpha succeeds, it could force a fundamental rethink of schooling. If it fails, it might become another cautionary tale in the long history of education reform.The bigger question: Disruption or hype?Bill Ackman’s endorsement has drawn attention to Alpha, but it also raises a broader question: Is this the beginning of a new era in education, or just a high-end experiment for tech-savvy families? As AI transforms industries worldwide, schools may be next in line for reinvention. For now, Alpha represents a daring attempt to answer an age-old question in a modern way: How do we prepare children for the future?Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future.

How much does it cost to study Psychology at Stanford University?

Stanford University's psychology program, renowned globally, presents significant costs for undergraduates, reaching approximately $82,000-$85,000 annually, while Ph.D. students benefit from lower tuition and substantial financial aid like assistantships and stipends. Additional expenses, including health insurance and personal costs, should also be considered by prospective students to manage their finances effectively.

Stanford University's psychology program, renowned globally, presents significant costs for undergraduates, reaching approximately $82,000-$85,000 annually, while Ph.D. students benefit from lower tuition and substantial financial aid like assistantships and stipends. Additional expenses, including health insurance and personal costs, should also be considered by prospective students to manage their finances effectively.  Stanford University, one of the world’s most prestigious institutions, offers a top-ranked psychology program at both undergraduate and doctoral levels. However, studying here comes at a significant cost, and understanding the financial commitment is crucial for prospective students. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the expenses for the 2024–2025 academic year.Cost of undergraduate Psychology programStudents enrolling in a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology at Stanford face an annual tuition of USD 62,484. Tuition alone makes up the largest portion of the expense, but students must also account for living costs. The estimated living expenses, which include housing, meals, and personal expenditures, amount to around USD 19,922 per year. Additionally, there are other mandatory charges such as health insurance, books, and miscellaneous personal costs. These can add a few thousand dollars more annually.When combined, the overall annual cost for an undergraduate psychology student typically falls between USD 82,000 and USD 85,000 per year. This figure varies depending on individual lifestyle choices, accommodation type, and personal spending habits.Cost of Ph.D. in Psychology at StanfordFor those pursuing a Ph.D. in Psychology, tuition is comparatively lower than undergraduate fees. The annual tuition for a graduate student is USD 38,160. The program typically spans five years, making the total tuition approximately USD 190,800 if fully self-funded.However, most doctoral students at Stanford benefit from significant financial aid. The university offers assistantships, fellowships, and stipends that usually cover tuition and provide a living allowance. Without funding, the estimated yearly cost, including tuition, living expenses (USD 19,000–USD 22,000), health insurance, and other fees, would range from USD 58,000 to USD 65,000 per year.What students should know about additional costsIn addition to tuition and housing, students should prepare for extra expenses such as health insurance (approximately USD 6,000–USD 7,000 annually), textbooks, and personal costs, which can add another USD 3,000–USD 5,000 per year. These numbers can vary based on course requirements and personal spending.Ph.D. students typically enjoy a better financial arrangement, as most receive tuition waivers and a stipend to cover living expenses in exchange for teaching or research responsibilities. This significantly reduces out-of-pocket costs for doctoral candidates.Final thoughtsStudying psychology at Stanford is a major investment, especially for international students. While undergraduate students largely bear the full cost, Ph.D. candidates often have access to substantial financial support that makes the program far more affordable. Prospective students should also explore Stanford’s financial aid programs, assistantships, and external scholarships to ease the financial burden.Ready to navigate global policies?

Federal court rules Montana students with disabilities can stay in school until age 22: How families can benefit

A federal court approved a settlement in Montana, enabling students with disabilities to remain in public education until age 22. This decision aligns Montana with the majority of U.S. states, offering extended access to tailored support and skill development. Students who graduated without a diploma in spring 2025 will have a re-enrollment opportunity.

A federal court approved a settlement in Montana, enabling students with disabilities to remain in public education until age 22. This decision aligns Montana with the majority of U.S. states, offering extended access to tailored support and skill development. Students who graduated without a diploma in spring 2025 will have a re-enrollment opportunity.  In a landmark decision, a federal district court has approved a settlement allowing Montana students with disabilities to remain in public education until the age of 22. As reported by the Associated Press, the ruling is expected to transform access to education for students with individualised education programs (IEPs), aligning Montana with most US states.What the court decidedOn August 13, Disability Rights Montana and the state reached a settlement requiring the Montana Office of Public Instruction (OPI) to offer education services beyond age 18 for students with disabilities.The ruling, approved by US District Judge Dana Christensen, includes a special re-enrollment period for students who graduated without a diploma in spring 2025. Families will have 30 days after notification to opt in. Students currently in school who planned to graduate without a diploma at 18 can now continue their education until 22.“The OPI will continue working with local school districts to ensure that every student exits high school prepared to succeed,” OPI spokesperson McKenna Gregg told Montana Free Press.How families can benefitExtra Years for Life Skills: Students will gain time to develop independent living, social, and vocational skills before transitioning to adulthood.Access to Special Education Services: Extended eligibility ensures that IEPs continue to provide tailored support through age 22.Opportunity for Re-enrollment: Students who missed out on a diploma earlier this year can return and complete their education.Why was this change necessary?Previously, Montana law limited public education to age 18 for students with disabilities. Advocates argued this deprived students of critical years needed for practical skill-building.A 2013 decision by the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Hawaii set a precedent, stating that students with disabilities are entitled to education until 22 if similar services are provided to others of that age group. Most states already follow this standard.Past legislative effortsThe issue had surfaced earlier during the 2021 Montana Legislature when Rep. Fred Anderson, R-Great Falls, introduced a bill aimed at funding education for students with IEPs aged 18–20. The proposal highlighted the need for extra time for these students to develop essential life skills, such as grocery shopping, appropriate public behavior, and independent living practices.Despite some support, the policy saw limited adoption across schools, which eventually led Disability Rights Montana to file a lawsuit earlier this year.What happens nextFamilies will receive notifications from OPI and have 30 days to respond for re-enrollment.Students currently enrolled who were planning to exit at 18 without a diploma can continue schooling until age 22.OPI will work with local districts to implement the settlement across Montana.This decision is widely seen as a major win for disability rights advocates and a step toward inclusive education across the state.With inputs from the Associated Press.Ready to navigate global policies?

What forced the US Education Department to reopen civil rights offices after months of shutdown?

The US Department of Education is reinstating over 260 employees to its Office for Civil Rights after a court order. This reversal follows a staff reduction that hindered civil rights enforcement, including Title IX protections. The decision addresses concerns about students' access to justice and the backlog of discrimination cases accumulated during the shutdown.

The US Department of Education is reinstating over 260 employees to its Office for Civil Rights after a court order. This reversal follows a staff reduction that hindered civil rights enforcement, including Title IX protections. The decision addresses concerns about students' access to justice and the backlog of discrimination cases accumulated during the shutdown.  After months of controversy and legal battles, the US Department of Education will reinstate more than 260 employees to its Office for Civil Rights (OCR), reversing a sweeping staff reduction that had left key civil rights enforcement functions on hold.The decision comes after a federal judge ordered the department to restore OCR operations, citing the harm caused to students who depend on these offices to resolve discrimination complaints. But what triggered this reversal after months of shutdown and $1 million-a-week in paid leave costs?The backstory: March layoffs and office closuresIn March 2025, the Education Department implemented a reduction in force (RIF) that impacted 1,300 employees across the agency. As part of these cuts, seven of OCR’s 12 regional offices were shut down, significantly reducing the department’s ability to enforce federal civil rights laws, including Title IX protections against gender discrimination and access for students with disabilities.The laid-off OCR staff were not working but remained on administrative leave, costing the department an estimated $1 million per week in salaries—a fact that sparked public criticism and political scrutiny, as reported by K-12 Dive.The legal push: Why the court stepped InThe turning point came with the case Victim Rights Law Center v. U.S. Department of Education, filed in April 2025 by two students who claimed they had suffered severe harassment and discrimination in school. They argued that OCR’s closure blocked their access to justice, preventing them from attending school safely.Judge Myong Joun agreed, ordering the department on June 18 to return OCR to “the status quo” so it could carry out its statutory functions. The department’s Aug. 19 court filing confirmed that OCR staff will return in phases every two weeks between Sept. 8 and Nov. 3.Why this matters for studentsOCR plays a critical role in investigating complaints of discrimination based on race, gender, disability, and other factors. Its downsizing sparked warnings from civil rights advocates and education policy experts that students’ equal access to education was at risk. Delayed investigations meant some students faced ongoing harm without federal intervention.What’s next?Employees will resume work in phases starting Sept. 8.OCR is expected to clear a backlog of discrimination cases accumulated during the shutdown.The broader legal fight over federal layoffs continues, with the Supreme Court allowing some departmental cuts while leaving OCR protections in place for now.The big questionThe reinstatement highlights a critical issue: Can cost-cutting justify dismantling agencies that protect student rights? For now, the courts have made it clear—when it comes to safeguarding education equality, civil rights enforcement is not optional.(With inputs from K-12 Dive)Ready to navigate global policies?

Mississippi DEI law hit by federal judge: Classrooms granted a temporary shield for free expression

A federal judge has blocked key provisions of Mississippi’s law restricting diversity, equity, and inclusion in public schools, citing constitutional concerns and threats to free expression. The injunction protects classroom discussions on race, gender identity, sexual orientation, and national origin while a broader legal challenge proceeds, highlighting tensions between academic freedom, state authority, and the evolving debate over DEI in education.

A federal judge has blocked key provisions of Mississippi’s law restricting diversity, equity, and inclusion in public schools, citing constitutional concerns and threats to free expression. The injunction protects classroom discussions on race, gender identity, sexual orientation, and national origin while a broader legal challenge proceeds, highlighting tensions between academic freedom, state authority, and the evolving debate over DEI in education.  A federal judge has delivered a significant rebuke to Mississippi’s controversial law curtailing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in public schools, citing constitutional concerns and the potential suppression of free expression. US District Judge Henry Wingate issued a preliminary injunction on Monday, granting temporary protection to educators, students, and academic staff while a broader legal battle proceeds. The ruling safeguards classroom discussions on sensitive topics, including race, gender identity, sexual orientation, and national origin, ensuring that academic inquiry and open dialogue are not unduly stifled by state mandates.The controversial lawMississippi’s legislation, which took effect in April, sought to prohibit schools from endorsing “divisive concepts” and dismantle DEI offices, programs, and training requirements. Schools failing to comply risked losing state funding. The injunction, however, does not affect sections of the law that forbid preferential treatment based on race or penalize refusal to adopt DEI principles.Constitutional concerns and academic freedomJudge Wingate characterized the law as “unconstitutionally vague,” warning that it threatens both free speech and academic inquiry. He also approved expanding the lawsuit into a class action, extending protections statewide. Educators testified that the law has left them uncertain about what can be safely taught. Divergent reactionsReactions to the ruling were sharply divided. Jarvis Dortch, executive director of the ACLU of Mississippi, hailed the decision as a victory for intellectual freedom, calling the law an attempt “to stop proper classroom discourse” as reported by CNBC News. State officials countered that public employees speak on behalf of the government, and that the legislation is aimed at institutional compliance rather than individual speech.Broader implicationsThe injunction highlights a nationwide debate on DEI, academic freedom, and the limits of state authority in education. While the ruling offers temporary relief, the ultimate impact of Mississippi’s DEI law on classrooms and scholarly expression remains uncertain, leaving teachers and students navigating a landscape of legal and educational ambiguity.Ready to navigate global policies?

H-1B hiring row: Tech job ads accused of prioritising immigrants over US workers

Amid tech sector layoffs and evolving hiring practices, the H-1B visa program faces increased scrutiny. Companies are subtly rerouting job postings, allegedly limiting opportunities for US workers. Simultaneously, policy tightening and political rhetoric fuel a backlash against high-skilled immigration, creating uncertainty for foreign professionals and reshaping the workforce.

Amid tech sector layoffs and evolving hiring practices, the H-1B visa program faces increased scrutiny. Companies are subtly rerouting job postings, allegedly limiting opportunities for US workers. Simultaneously, policy tightening and political rhetoric fuel a backlash against high-skilled immigration, creating uncertainty for foreign professionals and reshaping the workforce.  In a season where silence speaks louder than policy, the fine print of job advertisements is drawing sharper lines than campaign rhetoric. A recent report has shed light on the changing contours of H-1B hiring in the US technology sector—where compliance, optics, and intent now perform an uneasy dance.According to Newsweek, companies such as OpenAI and Instacart placed job advertisements in the San Francisco Chronicle and other outlets to meet the Department of Labor’s requirement that green card–sponsored positions be publicly listed. However, instead of directing applicants to general recruitment teams, the ads routed them to immigration or “global mobility” departments.US federal rules require such roles to be posted across multiple channels: Two major Sunday newspapers, state workforce agency websites, internal company portals, and a platform of the employer’s choice. The report suggests that routing applications through immigration departments may limit visibility for US-born candidates, prompting scrutiny over whether the system is being fairly implemented.Layoffs and the fragility of the H-1B promiseThe H-1B visa system was once positioned as America’s wager on meritocracy—a tool to import global expertise into its innovation arteries. In practice, it has evolved into a pressure valve for a corporate sector addicted to cost arbitrage and cyclical churn. According to Crunchbase, over 95,000 US-based tech workers were laid off in 2024 alone, with another 4,500 roles eliminated in a single week of July 2025. This is no ordinary correction. It is a recalibration of labour itself—away from scalable human capital toward AI-automated efficiencies. Salesforce has frozen software engineer hiring; others have simply offloaded at scale.Caught in this shift are Indian H-1B holders, who accounted for 72.6% of approved H-1B petitions in FY 2022, according to data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Many of these professionals are employed by top sponsoring firms such as Amazon, Infosys, TCS, and Cognizant—companies that have been central players in the ongoing tech sector contraction. Bloomberg estimates that over 200,000 tech workers were laid off in the US between November 2022 and January 2023, with 30–40% of them believed to be Indian IT professionals. According to industry estimates, around 80,000 Indian nationals on H-1B and L-1 visas have lost their jobs since late 2022, many of whom face a 60-day grace period under US immigration rules to secure new sponsorship or leave the country.The new face of America’s skilled immigration backlashThe employment crisis coincides with a sharp tightening of US visa policy. As reported by AP News, the Trump administration has launched a sweeping review of over 55 million valid visa holders, aiming to identify security risks, overstays, or other violations. The vetting process includes monitoring social media and, in some cases, requiring visa applicants to unlock electronic devices during interviews. Over 6,000 student visas have already been revoked, and some worker visa categories, such as those for commercial truck drivers, have been paused.Compounding the policy shift is a rise in political hostility towards high-skilled immigration. Former Trump strategist Steve Bannon has publicly called for a moratorium on all foreign student visas. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has gone further, explicitly demanding a ban on Indian H-1B visa holders, arguing they displace American graduates. What once existed on the political fringe is now influencing mainstream legislative rhetoric, with the H-1B and OPT pipelines becoming focal points in the broader immigration debate.A system mid-pivotThe convergence of corporate hiring practices, mass layoffs, administrative crackdowns, and political rhetoric signals a period of heightened scrutiny for visa-linked employment in the US While companies continue to sponsor H-1B workers, even amid domestic layoffs, debate continues over whether the system is serving its original intent—or facilitating structural reshaping of the workforce.The immigration system was designed to be merit-driven, but merit, it seems, is no longer the only currency. In its place: risk optics, political resonance, and a narrowing bandwidth of institutional patience.And so, in the quiet rerouting of a job listing or the sudden freeze of a hiring pipeline, the larger signal emerges—not in outrage or legality, but in the quiet erosion of certainty.Ready to navigate global policies?
