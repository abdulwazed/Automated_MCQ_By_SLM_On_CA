The film is now the 57th biggest Hindi hit. Its success shows the potential of mythological dramas. Content-driven films can compete with big ventures. Ashwin Kumar’s Mahavatar Narsimha has scripted yet another milestone at the box office. The mythological action drama, which has been witnessing steady collections since its release, crossed a new benchmark on Day 28. The Hindi version of the film addedRs 1.13 crore on its fourth Thursday, pushing its Hindi total to Rs 165.63 crore. With this, the film has officially surpassed Shah Rukh Khan’s Raees (Rs 164.63 crore) and Tiger Shroff’s Baaghi 2 (Rs 165.5 crore) to become the 57th biggest Hindi hit of all time.The journey of Mahavatar Narsimha has been nothing short of remarkable, especially considering the film’s relatively modest start. The Hindi version opened with just Rs 1.35 crore on Day 1, but it picked up pace quickly, and by the end of its first week, the Hindi tally stood at Rs 32.45 crore.From a ₹15-cr budget to ₹200-cr triumph: How Mahavatar Narsimha became India’s animated kingEven as new releases entered the market, the film demonstrated resilience. Week after week, despite drops, the Hindi version continued to collect in crores, bringing it to Rs 164.5 crore by Day 27. The Day 28 addition of Rs 1.13 crore proved to be the final nudge needed to leapfrog past two popular titles Raees, a Shah Rukh Khan starrer directed by Rahul Dholakia and backed by Farhan Ahktar and Ritesh Sidhwani and Tiger Shroff’s action blockbuster Baaghi 2 backed by Sajid Nadiadwala and co-staring Disha Patani. .What makes this feat even more impressive is the context. Unlike Raees or Baaghi 2, which rode on established stars with significant urban pull, Mahavatar Narsimha carved its space largely on content and grassroots reception. Audiences across have embraced the film, and its mythological narrative has struck a chord with both older demographics and younger viewers seeking spectacle.At Rs 165.63 crore, Mahavatar Narsimha may be at number 57 on the all-time Hindi chart, but its trajectory suggests that the film could rise further in the rankings if it continues its steady run into the fifth weekend. The absence of major Hindi releases in the immediate frame also works in its favor.In the bigger picture, the film’s success underlines two key trends at the box office. First, mythological dramas, when executed with scale and sincerity, have strong theatrical potential in Hindi markets. Second, content-driven films are increasingly capable of competing with big-banner commercial ventures, even when they lack the traditional “star vehicle” formula.For now, Mahavatar Narsimha has earned its place in Hindi cinema’s record books. From an underdog beginning to overtaking films fronted by Shah Rukh Khan and Tiger Shroff, its journey is a testament to the unpredictable, yet thrilling, nature of the Indian box office."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie  and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
