The new era of Pan-India collaborations

Bollywood stars are increasingly collaborating with South Indian filmmakers, driven by the success of pan-India films like 'Baahubali' and 'Jawan'. Actors like Hrithik Roshan, Shah Rukh Khan, and Aamir Khan are exploring partnerships with production houses and directors from the South to tap into a wider audience and leverage the scale and vision of Southern cinema.

Bollywood stars are increasingly collaborating with South Indian filmmakers, driven by the success of pan-India films like 'Baahubali' and 'Jawan'. Actors like Hrithik Roshan, Shah Rukh Khan, and Aamir Khan are exploring partnerships with production houses and directors from the South to tap into a wider audience and leverage the scale and vision of Southern cinema. For decades, Indian cinema has thrived on the diversity of its regional industries,Bollywood in Mumbai, Tollywood in Hyderabad, Kollywood in Chennai, Sandalwood in Bengaluru, and Mollywood in Kerala. Each industry boasted its unique style, storytelling traditions, and audience appeal. But the post-Baahubali era has changed the rules of the game forever. The term “pan-India” is no longer a buzzword; it’s a strategy. Today, the biggest names in Bollywood are consciously collaborating with the giants of South Indian cinema, signaling a historic synergy that could redefine the future of Indian filmmaking.There have been few examples wherein the collaboration has worked and in few it hasn’t. Take Shah Rukh Khan teaming up with Tamil director Atlee known for his films with Thalapathy Vijay, together they created Jawan which went on to be one of the biggest hits of Hindi Cinema. In comparison, War 2 with Jr NTR, when it was announced everyone felt this film would define the concept of Pan-India as two superstars from different industries Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR coming together but the film missed the expectations by a mile. Akshay Kumar teaming up with Rajinikanth for 2.0 with Shankar was also one of the first Pan-India collaborations that set the box office on fire. One of the most intriguing developments in recent months is the news of Hrithik Roshan in talks with Hombale Films, the banner behind Kantara, KGF and Salaar. Hombale has already emerged as one of the most influential production houses in the country, credited with pushing Kannada cinema onto the global map. For Hrithik, having ruled Bollywood for over two decades, his possible association with Hombale reflects a deliberate move towards projects that combine scale, spectacle, and a nationwide audience.PollWhich aspect of South Indian films do you find most appealing?Scale & VisualsStorytelling & PerformancesMeanwhile, reports suggest that Shah Rukh Khan may collaborate with Mythri Movie Makers, the powerhouse behind hits like Pushpa: The Rise, Pushpa 2- The Rule and Jaat. SRK’s Jawan with Atlee was already a landmark in the Bollywood-South collaboration narrative, and Mythri’s track record with mass entertainers makes this potential alliance particularly exciting. It also highlights how SRK, post his 2023 renaissance with Pathaan and Jawan, is carefully curating projects that expand his appeal across regions.Not to be left behind, Aamir Khan has reportedly shaken hands with Lokesh Kanagaraj, the man behind Kaithi, Master,Vikram, Leo: Bloody Sweet and recently released Coolie. Known for his gritty storytelling and masterful use of the “Lokesh Cinematic Universe (LCU),” Lokesh’s pairing with Aamir for a superhero film could be a perfect blend of meticulous acting with high-octane filmmaking.But it’s not just the “Khans” and Roshan. Several other Bollywood stars are now aligning themselves with South Indian giants.Emraan Hashmi, once Bollywood’s poster boy for romance-thrillers, has found a fresh footing with South collaborations. He’s part of two major projects Pawan Kalyan’s OG and Adivi Sesh’s G2. These films mark a significant career reinvention for Emraan, proving that Bollywood actors can tap into South Indian cinema’s massive fan bases to widen their reach.Deepika Padukone, after her groundbreaking role in Jawan, is set to collaborate again with Atlee, this time alongside Allu Arjun. The project has already become one of the most anticipated announcements, given Allu Arjun’s global fan base post-Pushpa.Kiara Advani is making her southern splash with Yash’s upcoming Toxic. With Yash riding high on the unprecedented success of KGF, Toxic is being positioned as a potential game-changer, and Kiara’s casting ensures a Bollywood connect for Hindi-speaking audiences.Bollywood stars who transitioned The current wave is not unprecedented. Several Bollywood stars had already paved the way for such transitions:Bobby Deol, riding high after Animal, has cemented his South presence with roles in Suriya’s Kanguva and Pawan Kalyan’sHari Hara Veera Mallu. Saif Ali Khan impressed audiences with his villainous turn in Jr NTR’s Devara. His presence lent the film an extra edge while also opening doors for more nuanced Bollywood imports into Telugu cinema.Sanjay Dutt has been one of the busiest Bollywood actors in the South in recent years. From KGF: Chapter 2 to Leo, his rugged screen presence has found a natural fit in larger-than-life South narratives.Alia Bhatt, Ajay Devgn, Kangana Ranaut, Raveena Tandon and Shilpa Shetty too have made appearances in South ventures, though on a smaller scale, reaffirming that the exchange has been happening for decades, albeit with less spotlight.Why south mattersScale and Vision: South filmmakers are increasingly celebrated for their audacity in scale. Films like RRR, KGF, Pushpa, and Baahubali have set new benchmarks for storytelling combined with technical brilliance.Pan-India Market: With the rise of multiplexes and OTT, the regional divide is narrowing. Audiences across India no longer care about labels; they only care about content. By collaborating with South big wigs, Bollywood stars can guarantee wider acceptance across linguistic markets.Fresh Pairings: The allure of never-seen-before combinations is irresistible. Whether it’s Deepika with Allu Arjun or Aamir with Lokesh Kanagaraj, these fresh pairings generate curiosity, fueling massive pre-release buzz.Box Office Muscle: Many South films have recently outperformed Bollywood blockbusters in North Indian markets. For instance, Baahubali 2, Pushpa 2, KGF 2 and RRR minted more than most Hindi films. Collaborating with South industries ensures Bollywood actors remain competitive in this new box office reality.

Irani highlights Khan's inclusive nature, ensuring co-stars feel comfortable and valued. Despite a recent injury and recovery period, Shah Rukh Khan was recently honored with the National Award for Best Actor for 'Jawan'.

Boman Irani fondly recalls his experiences with Shah Rukh Khan, emphasising his generosity and the joyful atmosphere he creates on set. Irani highlights Khan's inclusive nature, ensuring co-stars feel comfortable and valued. Despite a recent injury and recovery period, Shah Rukh Khan was recently honored with the National Award for Best Actor for 'Jawan'.  Shah Rukh Khan is not only adored by millions of fans but also deeply admired by his co-stars. Almost everyone who has shared screen space with him in his three-decade-long career has spoken warmly about the superstar. Among them is 'Happy New Year' co-star Boman Irani, who recently reflected on his bond with Shah Rukh. Though he jokingly described him as “extremely boring,” the rest of his memories of working with him were filled with affection and admiration.In a conversation with Humans of Bombay, Boman said, “Shah Rukh (Khan) enjoys being on a set. He enjoys being with people. He enjoys the collective nature of creating a movie. For me, there is really a naughty side to him. He is very giving. He is very big hearted.”Shah Rukh Khan Jokes About Injury: 'One Hand Enough For National Award'Boman went on to describe Shah Rukh’s famously warm hospitality on set. “His suite door will always be open. There will be all the snacks on one side. People walk in and walk out, pick up snacks. He plays games with them when he has the time. The set is always fun,” he revealed.Sharing why Shah Rukh is among his favourite people to work with, Boman added, “Sometimes, when we are performing… and things go wrong, we find it funny. Rather than be desperate. That’s a great talent to have. We know we will get there. He knows he will.”He also pointed out how SRK never makes his co-stars feel overshadowed by his stardom. “Shah Rukh doesn’t allow you to think like that with him. He doesn’t allow you to get there,” Boman said, highlighting the humility that makes the superstar so beloved on and off screen.However, Boman has only one problem with SRK, that he's very boring with his food. He added, "He is extremely boring. He only eats tandoor chicken and nothing else. He is not a restaurant kinda guy. He will come with us, but he won’t eat. The food is lying over there, he is talking and it is getting cold and everybody is enjoying a lovely meal par Shah Rukh ko koi farq nahi padta ( but none of this affects SRK). So I do have a problem there. He doesn’t give me a company when it comes to food.”On work front, Shah Rukh is currently working on 'King', but the actor suffered and injury and is currently recuperating. He recently said at the event to launch son Aryan Khan's show 'B***ds of Bollywood' that it will take him 1-2 months to recover. Meanwhile, the actor recently was announced as the recipient of the National Award for Best Actor for 'Jawan'."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie  and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

‘War 2’ box office collection day 9 (LIVE)

Despite high expectations, 'War 2,' starring Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR, has underperformed, earning ₹203.96 crore in its extended first week. While surpassing 'Saiyaara,' it lags behind 'Chhaava' in profitability due to its high budget.

Despite high expectations, 'War 2,' starring Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR, has underperformed, earning ₹203.96 crore in its extended first week. While surpassing 'Saiyaara,' it lags behind 'Chhaava' in profitability due to its high budget.  Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR’s high-octane spy thriller War 2 has officially wrapped up its extended first week, though the results haven’t quite lived up to the enormous hype surrounding it. Directed by Ayan Mukerji, the YRF actioner has performed better than any other Bollywood film released in 2025 so far, except for ‘Chhaava’, which continues to dominate the box office. ‘Saiyaara’ had managed to make Rs 174 crore in a week’s time but ‘War 2’ has crossed that. However, a film with newcomers making that number in week 1 is much more profitable when it comes to the return on investment, as compared to a biggie like ‘War 2’ where the budget is so high. War 2 Movie Review'War 2' review: Stylish spy thriller with Hrithik–Jr NTR chemistry divides fans over story and VFX While the film benefited from a strategic early release ahead of Independence Day, giving it an extended 8-day weekend, the momentum seems to be wearing thin. Even with minimal competition from Saiyaara and Mahavatar Narsimha, the film saw another drop in numbers. While the box office numbers are not insignificant—making War 2 only the second Bollywood release of 2025 to enter the ₹200 crore club in its opening week, the overall performance has left fans and industry insiders underwhelmed.PollDid you enjoy 'War 2' more than 'Chhaava'?Yes, definitely!No, I preferred 'Chhaava'. On Saturday, the film made Rs 33 crore of which the Hindi version made Rs 26 crore. There was a huge drop in the collections of the Telugu version of the film. While the Telugu version made Rs 22.75 crore on Day 1, the number dropped to Rs 12.5 crore on Day 2 and more down to 50 percent of that on day 3. On Sunday, the total collection of 'War 2' in all languages was Rs 31.3 crore which was a drop from the Saturday numbers. On Monday, it collected Rs 8.50 crore as a total in all languages. On Tuesday as well, it started on a slow note and made Rs 9 crore on Tuesday. This number on Tuesday, could be due to the discounted ticket rates in many theatres. On Wednesday, the movie was expected to cross Rs 200 crore but just missed it by a hair. It collected Rs 5.50 crore on day 7. On Thursday, which was day 8, the film saw further drop and made Rs 4.71 crore. With that, the first week total of the movie is Rs 203.96 crore. Now on Friday, day 9, till afternoon, the collection was around Rs 1.49 crore. Thus, the total at the domestic box office now stands at Rs 204.47 crore.

Anurag quit alcohol after leaving Mumbai

Anurag Kashyap left Mumbai, feeling drained by the Hindi film industry. He felt depressed by Bollywood's focus on box office numbers and declining film quality. Kashyap moved to the South, quit drinking, and started exercising. He found creative inspiration and began writing more. He felt avoided by Hindi filmmakers and questioned his time in Mumbai.

Anurag Kashyap left Mumbai, feeling drained by the Hindi film industry. He felt depressed by Bollywood's focus on box office numbers and declining film quality. Kashyap moved to the South, quit drinking, and started exercising. He found creative inspiration and began writing more. He felt avoided by Hindi filmmakers and questioned his time in Mumbai.  Anurag Kashyap has candidly spoken about why he chose to step away from Mumbai, revealing that the atmosphere of the Hindi film industry had left him drained, depressed, and disillusioned. The filmmaker said he grew weary of Bollywood’s obsession with box office numbers and what he sees as a decline in the quality of films being made. After shifting base to the South, Kashyap shared that he quit drinking, began exercising, and has found himself writing more than ever.In a conversation on Sudhir Srinivasan’s YouTube channel, Anurag admitted that he couldn’t cope with the negativity surrounding him in Mumbai. He recalled how people around him began positioning themselves as ‘saviours’ for his career, and how industry peers distanced themselves, believing he was on a downward spiral. “I went into a depression. I’ve come out of it. I’m enjoying myself now. One thing I did was, I stopped watching Hindi films. I started watching a lot of films from first-time filmmakers, I started watching a lot of Malayalam films,” he said, adding that working on Rifle Club played a key role in reigniting his creative spark.Anurag Kashyap Exposes T-Series For Underpaying Iconic Film MusicAccording to him, Bollywood colleagues had started to avoid him altogether. “Hindi filmmakers have been avoiding me, because they think I’m bad new, because they think I have no filter and I talk. They think that if they get associated with me, they might not get (to work with) some studio or somebody else will get upset. And I’ve come to a place that I’m inspired by, and people have so much love for me,” he explained. The warmth he felt in the South, he added, made him question his years in Mumbai. “Why am I in a place where I’m being told that people are talking about your alcoholism, people are talking about your depression, people are saying you’re losing your way. They’re trying to be my saviour and telling me what I must do to save me from myself,” he said.On giving up alcohol, Anurag revealed it wasn’t a forced decision. “I don’t have to deal with people. Automatically, I started exercising. Automatically, I started writing,” he shared.Kashyap has previously criticized the Hindi film industry for being overly money-driven, and even said that actors he once collaborated with now ghost him. He also spoke about how his mental health suffered after Netflix shelved his dream project Maximum City, with several other completed films of his stuck in limbo. Now, though, some of those projects are finally finding their way out: Nishaanchi is set for release on September 19, while Bandar and Kennedy await their turn."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie  and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Coolie beats Robot as Rajinikanth’s 2nd biggest Hindi hit

Rajinikanth's Coolie is a hit. The film earned Rs 229.73 crore domestically. Its Hindi version surpassed Robot's collection. Coolie's Hindi version earned Rs 26.02 crore in eight days. The film opened well and maintained momentum. Despite competition from War 2, Coolie performed strongly. Experts predict further growth in collections. Coolie is Rajinikanth's third biggest hit.

Rajinikanth's Coolie is a hit. The film earned Rs 229.73 crore domestically. Its Hindi version surpassed Robot's collection. Coolie's Hindi version earned Rs 26.02 crore in eight days. The film opened well and maintained momentum. Despite competition from War 2, Coolie performed strongly. Experts predict further growth in collections. Coolie is Rajinikanth's third biggest hit. Rajinikanth’s latest outing Coolie is proving to be a true pan-India phenomenon. While the film has already stormed the South Indian markets and taken its overall domestic tally to a staggering Rs 229.73 crore, its Hindi version too has achieved a significant milestone. In just eight days, Coolie’s Hindi version has collected Rs 26.02 crore nett , making it Rajinikanth’s second biggest hit in Hindi by surpassing Shankar’s Robot (2010), which had earned Rs 23.84 crore from its Hindi release.The numbers highlight how Rajinikanth’s reach in the Hindi belt has grown stronger over the years. Coolie opened decently in Hindi withRs 4.5 crore on Day 1, and gained momentum over the weekend, mintingRs 6.25 crore on Day 2 and a solid Rs 4.25 crore on Day 3 and Rs 4.75 on day 4 . By its extended weekend the film had already clocked more than Rs 19 crore in Hindi. The weekdays saw a steady trend with collections of Rs 1.85 crore on Day 5,Rs 2 crore on Day 6 ,Rs 1.3 crore on Day 6, Rs 1.3 crore on Day 7 and Rs 1.12 on Day 8 as per early estimates by Sacnilk.‘Coolie’ release sparks madness: Rajinikanth fans dance and flood theatres in Tamil NaduFor context, Rajinikanth’s biggest-ever hit in Hindi remains 2.0 (2018), which collected over Rs 189 crore in its dubbed version thanks to its spectacular VFX and Akshay Kumar’s presence in a villainous role. While Coolie is still far behind that benchmark, crossing Robot’s lifetime Hindi total in just eight days is a clear indication of its strong reception.What adds weight to Coolie’s success is the competition it has faced. The film released alongside Hrithik Roshan, Jr NTR and Kiara Advani’s War 2, yet managed to hold its ground firmly in the North. While War 2 had an edge in terms of screen count in the Hindi-speaking markets, Coolie managed to carve out a solid audience for itself, especially in single screens and tier-2 cities.WithRs 229.73 crore overall, Coolie has already become Rajinikanth’s third biggest hit of all time, standing only behind 2.0 and Jailer. Industry experts predict that the film has enough momentum to continue adding to its tally in the next week as well and could possibly hit the Rs 275 crore mark.For Rajinikanth, Coolie marks yet another affirmation of his enduring superstardom.

Aryan Khan, son of Shah Rukh Khan, is making his directorial debut with 'The Ba***ds of Bollywood,' premiering on OTT on September 18. Manoj Pahwa, who worked with SRK in 'Josh,' praises Aryan's professionalism, work ethic, and perfectionism, noting his resemblance to his father.

Aryan Khan is stepping into the spotlight not just as Shah Rukh Khan’s son, but as a young filmmaker determined to make his own mark. Veteran actor Manoj Pahwa, who shared the screen with SRK in Josh (2000), calls Aryan the “spitting image” of his father, in looks, voice, and work ethic.In a chat with The Print, Pahwa said, “Aryan is following in his father’s footsteps. He (Aryan) is a hardcore professional, a workaholic, and he works very hard just like SRK.” Stars hail Aryan Khan for 'Ba***ds of Bollywood'| Preview sparks rave reviewsNow, with his directorial debut ‘The Ba***ds of Bollywood’ premiering on OTT from 18 September, Aryan is proving that talent and dedication run in the family.Pahwa highlights Aryan’s high expectations and focusManoj Pahwa emphasised that Aryan knew the pressure he carried, given his father’s legendary status. “And I am glad Aryan didn’t take it lightly. He has put in every bit of effort in bringing this project to life,” he said. The actor sees a reflection of SRK’s commitment in Aryan’s work. It’s not just ambition but a genuine love for filmmaking that pushes the young director to give his best at every stage.Actor impressed by Aryan’s creative character visionIn the show, Pahwa plays the protagonist’s uncle, an aspiring actor who hasn’t found success in Bollywood. While supporting his nephew in the glitzy world of films, he also struggles with envy.Pahwa explained, “When I first met Aryan and heard about the character and storyline, the experience was far beyond what I had anticipated. It was his first project. He is a young lad. I didn’t expect that the narrations would be pitch-perfect. I was blown away in that first meeting itself.” Aryan’s perfectionism is visible during multiple retakesWorking on set with Aryan was a refreshing experience, says Pahwa. He admired Aryan’s insistence on multiple retakes to get every shot just right. “He is new to the field but he doesn’t get satisfied easily. He would take multiple retakes until he was happy. I would call him a perfectionist,” he said.Although repeated takes occasionally caused slight irritation, the final results made it worth the effort. “But, when we see the results, it’s all worth it.”Clarification that show scenes not linked to incidentA scene from the preview showed the protagonist behind bars, with a cop telling him not to worry because people become more famous after being imprisoned. Some fans speculated it referenced Aryan’s 2021 wrongful arrest in a drugs case. Pahwa has now clarified, “There is no relation between the scene and the incident.” He stressed that ‘The Ba***ds of Bollywood’ is purely fictional and not tied to real-life events.About ‘The Ba***ds of Bollywood’Alongside Pahwa, ‘The Ba***ds of Bollywood’ features Lakshay, Raghav Juyal, Mona Singh, Manish Chaudhari, Anya Singh, Vijayant Kohli, and Gautami Kapoor.

Week after week, despite drops, the Hindi version continued to collect in crores, bringing it to Rs 164.5 crore by Day 27. The Day 28 addition of Rs 1.13 crore proved to be the final nudge needed to leapfrog past two popular titles Raees, a Shah Rukh Khan starrer directed by Rahul Dholakia and backed by Farhan Ahktar and Ritesh Sidhwani and Tiger Shroff’s action blockbuster Baaghi 2 backed by Sajid Nadiadwala and co-staring Disha Patani. .What makes this feat even more impressive is the context. Unlike Raees or Baaghi 2, which rode on established stars with significant urban pull, Mahavatar Narsimha carved its space largely on content and grassroots reception. Audiences across have embraced the film, and its mythological narrative has struck a chord with both older demographics and younger viewers seeking spectacle.At Rs 165.63 crore, Mahavatar Narsimha may be at number 57 on the all-time Hindi chart, but its trajectory suggests that the film could rise further in the rankings if it continues its steady run into the fifth weekend. The absence of major Hindi releases in the immediate frame also works in its favor.In the bigger picture, the film’s success underlines two key trends at the box office. First, mythological dramas, when executed with scale and sincerity, have strong theatrical potential in Hindi markets. Second, content-driven films are increasingly capable of competing with big-banner commercial ventures, even when they lack the traditional “star vehicle” formula.For now, Mahavatar Narsimha has earned its place in Hindi cinema’s record books. From an underdog beginning to overtaking films fronted by Shah Rukh Khan and Tiger Shroff, its journey is a testament to the unpredictable, yet thrilling, nature of the Indian box office."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie  and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

A hacking syndicate targeted South Korean elites, stealing over ₹235 crore by infiltrating telecom websites and exploiting personal data. BTS's Jungkook was a key target; hackers attempted to steal ₹52 crore worth of HYBE stock after his military enlistment. Fortunately, BigHit Music intervened, preventing financial loss. Jungkook A notorious hacking syndicate orchestrated a bold scheme to rob financial assets from prominent South Koreans, striking at the heart of the nation's elite. Operating from overseas, the group infiltrated domestic telecom websites to harvest sensitive personal data, which they then weaponised to access bank accounts and cryptocurrency holdings. This calculated intrusion spanned from August 2023 to January 2024, resulting in staggering losses exceeding 38 billion KRW (Rs 235.6 crore), according to Yonhap News reports citing official figures from the Ministry of Justice. Among the high-profile victims were business tycoons, venture capitalists, and entertainment icons, with the hackers opening fake mobile accounts to siphon funds undetected. Jungkook's close call in the spotlight BTS sensation Jungkook, famed for tracks like 'Seven' and 'Standing Next to You', emerged as a key target in this cyber onslaught. Shortly after his military enlistment in January 2024, hackers exploited his identity to breach his securities account, attempting to steal 33,500 shares of HYBE stock valued at approximately 8.4 billion KRW (₹52.08 crore), as detailed in Yonhap News coverage. The perpetrators transferred the shares to unauthorised accounts and even sold 500 of them to a third party, aiming to cash in on the ill-got gains. Fortunately, swift intervention by his agency, BigHit Music, froze the transactions and initiated recovery efforts, averting any actual financial damage. Jungkook successfully reclaimed the sold shares through a civil lawsuit, with the Seoul Western District Court ruling in his favour earlier this year, highlighting the artist's resilience amid the chaos.Tense extradition and global pursuit The alleged mastermind, a 34-year-old Chinese national, faced a dramatic downfall after months of relentless international tracking. Captured in Thailand following a tip-off in April, he was extradited to South Korea on August 22, 2025, arriving at Incheon International Airport under heavy guard. This breakthrough stemmed from collaborative efforts involving the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, Interpol, and Thailand's authorities via the Southeast Asia Justice Network, as outlined in Yonhap News. The suspect, who assembled the hacking crew abroad, now awaits interrogation and potential arrest warrants as investigators dissect seized devices for more evidence. This case underscores the power of cross-border alliances in dismantling cyber networks that prey on vulnerable high-net-worth individuals."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie  and War 2."About the AuthorKorean DeskKorean Desk covers news and stories from South Korea’s entertainment scene.

‘War 2’ becomes Hrithik's 5th biggest grosser

Hrithik Roshan's 'War 2' has earned ₹204.25 crore, becoming his fifth-biggest Hindi hit, surpassing 'Super 30'. Despite this milestone, the film's performance has received mixed reactions, falling short of expectations given its connection to the Spy Universe and the success of the original 'War'. 'Coolie' has shown stronger momentum, particularly in mass circuits.

Hrithik Roshan's 'War 2' has earned ₹204.25 crore, becoming his fifth-biggest Hindi hit, surpassing 'Super 30'. Despite this milestone, the film's performance has received mixed reactions, falling short of expectations given its connection to the Spy Universe and the success of the original 'War'. 'Coolie' has shown stronger momentum, particularly in mass circuits. Hrithik Roshan’s much-anticipated War 2 has crossed a key milestone at the box office, emerging as the actor’s fifth biggest Hindi hit to date. The film has minted Rs 150 crore in its first eight days, and as of now, its overall collection stands at Rs 204.25 crore. With this, War 2 has overtaken Hrithik’s 2019 hit Super 30, directed by Vikas Bahl, which had managed a lifetime total ofRs 147.39 crore.While this achievement strengthens Hrithik’s standing as one of Bollywood’s most bankable stars, the film’s performance has sparked mixed reactions. In isolation, crossing theRs 200 crore mark within little over a week is no small feat given that the film is part of Spy Universe and a sequel to the blockbuster War led by Hrithik Roshan and Tiger Shroff, hence the numbers fall short of the hype.Hrithik Roshan calls Jr. NTR 'incredible' and his favorite co‑star for 'War 2'Adding to its advantage, War 2 enjoyed a wider release in North India despite facing competition from Rajinikanth’s Coolie, which has already amassed Rs 229.75 crore. The Hrithik-starrer may have secured more screens, but Coolie has clearly had the edge in terms of momentum and audience pull, particularly in mass circuits.Both the films lost steam once the weekend was over. PollWhich film do you think will deliver better action: War or War 2?WarWar 2For Hrithik Roshan, War 2 now sits at number five in his all-time highest-grossing films list. His top four remain unchanged:War –Rs 303.34 croreKrrish 3 –Rs 231.79 croreFighter –Rs 212.79 croreBang Bang! –Rs 174.51 croreWith War 2 clocking in at Rs 150 crore, it has comfortably pushed Super 30 out of the top five. Yet, comparisons with its predecessor underline the sense of underperformance. The original War was not only a record-shattering success but also cemented Hrithik and Tiger’s action chemistry as a major box office force. The sequel, despite its scale and the promise of extending the Spy Universe, hasn’t quite managed to recreate that euphoria.The coming weekend will be crucial. Historically, Hrithik’s films tend to enjoy strong second-weekend jumps if word of mouth holds, and War 2 could benefit from it. A small spike is expected, but whether the film has enough legs to cross Fighter or even challenge Krrish 3 in the long run remains to be seen."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie  and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
