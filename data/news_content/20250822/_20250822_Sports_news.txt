He also expressed surprise over Shreyas Iyer and Yashasvi Jaiswal's exclusion from the Asia Cup squad, despite their strong performances. India vs Pakistan T20 game (X- Hardik Pandya) Former Indian cricketer Manoj Tiwary has expressed concerns about the upcoming India-Pakistan cricket match at the Asia Cup 2025, questioning its appropriateness in light of the recent Pahalgam terror attack and subsequent Operation Sindoor. The match scheduling has sparked debate, particularly after Indian legends recently boycotted their games against Pakistan in the World Championships of Legends due to bilateral tensions.India is set to begin their Asia Cup campaign against the UAE on September 10, followed by the highly anticipated match against Pakistan on September 14 in Dubai. Their final group stage match will be against Oman on September 19 in Abu Dhabi.EXCLUSIVE: India to boycott Pakistan in Asia Cup? Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'Operation Sindoor, launched in May by the Indian Armed Forces, targeted Pakistan-backed terror groups following the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22. The operation resulted in over 100 casualties among terrorists affiliated with groups like Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Hizbul Mujahideen in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

After the Pahalgam attack, in which so many innocent civilians were killed, and then the war that followed, a lot of talk was going on that this time we will give a befitting reply. Despite this, after a few months, everything has been forgotten... I find it hard to believe that this match is happening, that the value of a human life can be zero. What do they want to achieve by playing with Pakistan?... The value of a human life should be more than sports... There is no question of me watching the match at all..." Tiwary told ANI.The Indian team for the Asia Cup 2025 was announced on Tuesday, with Suryakumar named as captain and Shubman Gill as vice-captain. The announcement came during a press conference attended by T20I skipper Suryakumar and chief selector Ajit Agarkar, following a selection meeting that included BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia.PollShould the India-Pakistan match at the Asia Cup 2025 be canceled due to recent tensions?Yes, it should be canceled.No, it should proceed as planned.Notable exclusions from the main squad include Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shreyas Iyer, despite their impressive performances in the IPL this year for Rajasthan Royals and Punjab Kings respectively. Jaiswal has been placed in the reserves alongside Washington Sundar, Riyan Parag, Prasidh Krishna, and Dhruv Jurel."Two deserving candidates, Shreyas Iyer and Yashasvi Jaiswal, have not been able to make it to the team... If you see old videos of Gautam Gambhir, he had said that Yashasvi Jaiswal is such a player that we cannot think of keeping him out of T-20. Now that he himself is the coach, there is no place for Shreyas Iyer in the team. Shreyas Iyer's performance is the best if you look at the last year... It's eye-opening that he didn't get a place in the T20... The selection process should be made live so that sports lovers know who has been selected and why..." Tiwary commented on the team selection.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

SUBSCRIBE NOW!The 2025 Women's World Cup matches were moved out of Bengaluru as the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) failed to secure permission for the games following the tragic events of June 4 when RCB's victory march turned tragic resulting in death of 11 fans and injuries to scores due to a stampede, despite being granted an extension in this regard by the BCCI. The DY Patil Stadium will now host five matches in the tournament, which comprise the three league matches (Bangladesh versus Sri Lanka match on Oct 20, India versus New Zealand clash on Oct 23, India versus Bangladesh match on Oct 26, the second semifinal on Oct 30 and potentially the final (provided that Pakistan don't make it to the summit clash) of the 13th edition of the Women's ODI World Cup on Nov 2. The opening match of the tournament, between hosts India and Sri Lanka, will now be held on Sept 30 in Guwahati. The rest of the schedule of the tournament remains unchanged.This will be the first-ever ICC tournament to be staged at the world-class DY Patil Stadium, which has witnessed a full house (45,000 capacity crowd) for Women's international matches in recent years-the 20022 India versus Australia T20I series being a prime example. The DY Patil Stadium had staged 11 matches of the inaugural season of the Women's Premier League in March 2023. The state of the art stadium also hosted Indian Premier League (IPL) finals in 2008 and 2010, when the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai was undergoing massive renovation.Endorsing the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai as "a genuine home for women's cricket," ICC chairman Jay Shah said, “Navi Mumbai has emerged as a genuine home for women’s cricket in recent years. The support it has received during international fixtures and the Women’s Premier League has been remarkable, creating an atmosphere that elevates the players and inspires fans. I am certain that the same energy will define the big matches of the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup as it returns to India after 12 years." “We stand at a pivotal moment in the journey of the women’s game. This World Cup has the potential to be remembered as one of those defining milestones that shaped the sport’s future, not only in India but across the cricketing world. While unforeseen circumstances required us to adjust the schedule and replace a venue, we are pleased to now have a line-up of five world-class venues that will showcase the very best of the women’s game. The stage is set, and I am confident this tournament will capture imaginations and inspire a new generation of fans,” he added.Expressing his gratitude to ICC chairman Jay Shah after being asked to host an ICC tournament for the first time in the venue's history, Vijay Patil, the owner of the DY Patil Stadium, and a former president of the Mumbai Cricket Association, told TOI on Friday,"I would like to thank Jay Shah, the chairman of the International Cricket Council, BCCI for allocating the Women's World Cup matches to the DY Patil Stadium for the first time ever. It's a great step forward for Women's cricket and a massive opportunity for fans in the region. I am truly thrilled and overwhelmed with news," The tournament dates of 30 September - 2 November remain unchanged, as do the other venues, which are the ACA Stadium (Guwahati), Holkar Stadium (Indore), ACA-VDCA Stadium (Visakhapatnam) and R. Premadasa Stadium (Colombo, Sri Lanka).The final of the tournament will be held either in Colombo or Navi Mumbai on 2 November, with the first semifinal set to be in Guwahati or Colombo on 29 October and the second semifinal in Navi Mumbai on 30 October.The ICC announcement ended days of suspense over the venue which will replace Bengaluru as the host of the upcoming Women's World Cup, which begins from Sept 30 in India and Sri Lanka. It had been reported by the media that Thiruvananthapuram too is a favourite for the displaced games, but again, Kerala experiences relentless rain at that time of the year. The only glitch is that Mumbai too experiences incessant rain till the end of Sept, but the monsoon should relent when the tournament moves to Navi Mumbai on Oct 23. Last Monday, the ICC marked the 50-day countdown to the tournament with an event in Mumbai.The uncertainty over Bengaluru matches led the ICC to delay the ticket sales for the matches of the tournament too.The Chinnaswamy Stadium was initially allotted five games of the 2025 Women's World Cup. Besides the tournament opener, the other league games originally slotted to Bengaluru were England-South Africa (on October 3), India-Bangladesh (on October 26), and then the two knockout matches. However, things became difficult, with the State Government toughening its stand towards cricket matches at the Chinnaswamy Stadium following the stampede tragedy. The Karnataka government recently did not give permission for the Maharaja Cup which had to be shifted to Mysuru.The eight competing teams for the Women's World Cup are Australia, England, South Africa, New Zealand, Bangladesh and Pakistan besides hosts India and Sri Lanka.

Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'Breetzke had already announced himself in international cricket with a record-breaking 150 on ODI debut against New Zealand earlier this year, the highest score by any batter in their first match.

However, since he did not bat in his third match against Zimbabwe, it had taken him five ODIs to achieve the feat.Coming in at No. 4 after South Africa lost both openers cheaply to Xavier Bartlett, Breetzke steadied the innings with partnerships alongside Tony de Zorzi (38) and Tristan Stubbs (74 off 87). His innings included eight boundaries and two sixes, and though he fell just 12 runs short of a second century, his contribution was pivotal in guiding the Proteas to a competitive 277 in 49.1 overs.Australia’s Adam Zampa (3/63) and Nathan Ellis (2/46) ensured South Africa couldn’t push beyond 300, but Breetzke’s landmark will stand out as the talking point of the day.

The exchange, which aired in 2014, resurfaced for the singer’s candid and light-heartedly hilarious remarks about the sport. At the time, Pietersen was promoting his autobiography KP: The Autobiography, which revisited the infamous “textgate” controversy of 2012. The former England batter faced pointed questions from Norton about sending provocative messages to members of the South African team during a Test series, a scandal that tainted his relationship with then-captain Andrew Strauss.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

Morecambe FC become first English club to be owned by Sikhs, appoint Sikh boss

Ashvir Singh Johal takes charge as Morecambe FC manager (Images via X/@AshvirJohal)  Morecambe FC have made history after becoming the first professional football club in England to be owned by Sikh owners, following a takeover by Panjab Warriors this week. The landmark moment was further underlined when Ashvir Singh Johal was appointed as the new manager, making him the first Sikh to lead a professional British club. The new owners said that they want their cultural identity and values to guide the way they run the National League side. “Punjab, the land of five rivers, is our native land,” Gurpreet Singh, the group’s head of communications, told BBC. “For us, our heritage, our culture and our faith are our core principles. They make us who we are. And it is these principles – discipline, trustfulness, compassion – that we want to bring to Morecambe.”Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Morecambe chief executive Ropinder Singh also reflected those sentiments. “There is no better marriage than Punjab and football,” he told BBC. “The doors are open for everybody. The idea is that we want to change the narrative that football ownership is an unethical process.” The development has been welcomed across the Sikh community in the UK and beyond. Jagbir Jhutti-Johal, professor of Sikh studies at the University of Birmingham, told BBC: “People back home in Punjab will be very proud of the fact that Sikhs are running a club here. Sikhs in America, Canada, etc, will be watching closely. And those in the UK, even if they might be fans of Liverpool or Manchester United, will also be rooting for Morecambe.” Johal’s appointment has been described as a powerful moment of representation. Preetam Singh, founder of Stretford Sikhs, which is Manchester United’s first official Sikh supporters’ club said, “Ashvir wears a patka and has a dadhi, so the clear image of a Sikh is now out there on a big stage. People notice, they ask questions, they learn. Even his name and appearance alone can spark understanding – and that’s going to have a massive impact.” Former referee Jarnail Singh, the first turban-wearing official in English league football, also underlined the significance. “For the South Asian community, and especially the Sikh community, I think it’s absolutely superb where we actually have broken the glass ceiling in terms of going into management,” he told BBC. “It just gives everybody the drive to know that one of our Sikhs has reached the pinnacle as a manager, and he’ll be a great role model.” For Johal himself, the appointment is less about symbolism and more about his coaching ambitions. His father, Kulvinder, said, “At the moment, Ash has got a job to do. He’s not purposely gone out to be a role model. He is chasing his dream to be a coach. This is another milestone in a career that began when he was 15, 16 years old.”PollDo you believe Ashvir Singh Johal's appointment as the first Sikh manager in British professional football is significant?Yes, it's a major milestoneNo, it's just a coincidence He added, “If along the way he happens to become a role model for other people in the community, if this allows others to chase their dreams, then that can only be a good thing for the UK as a whole.”Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

USA Cricket severs ties with strategic partner ACE; risks bankruptcy

USA Cricket has ended its agreement with American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), the force behind Major League Cricket, leading to uncertainty surrounding World Cup preparations and financial stability. The decision, driven by board members, raises concerns about potential bankruptcy due to the loss of ACE's financial support, which has totalled over $10 million since 2019.

USA Cricket has ended its agreement with American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), the force behind Major League Cricket, leading to uncertainty surrounding World Cup preparations and financial stability. The decision, driven by board members, raises concerns about potential bankruptcy due to the loss of ACE's financial support, which has totalled over $10 million since 2019. A fan watches a cricket match during the third season of Major League Cricket in USA. (Sportzpics) USA Cricket has formally terminated its 50-year agreement with American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), the company behind Major League Cricket, following a three-hour board meeting, reported Cricbuzz. The decision, supported by Chairman Venu Pisike and a faction of board members, has created uncertainty around World Cup preparations and financial stability for the organisation that has been under ICC suspension since July 2024.The termination notice was initiated by Chairman Venu Pisike and Board Member David Haubert, gaining support from Srini Salver, Anj Balusu, and Pintoo Shah. This group outvoted opposing directors Nadia Gruny, Kuljit Nijjar, Atul Rai, and Arjun Gona.Major League Cricket 2025 Explained: Teams, Schedule & Where to WatchThe original partnership, established in June 2019, granted ACE exclusive rights to operate a premier T20 league in the United States and manage the commercialisation of national teams and cricket infrastructure development.USA Cricket CEO Johnathan Atkeison and legal counsel present at the meeting expressed concerns about the decision. The board's legal counsel indicated that the termination might not withstand arbitration, while an external attorney reportedly labeled the decision as "reckless."The financial implications of this decision are significant. Sources indicate that USA Cricket could face bankruptcy within weeks without ACE's quarterly payments. Since 2019, ACE has provided over $10 million in support for sanction fees, operating costs, and player payments.The dispute primarily focuses on the management and finances of the US National Team. USA Cricket has expressed their desire for Major League Cricket to continue operations, noting that MLC's ICC sanction removes dependency on USA Cricket for continuity.The termination impacts immediate preparation plans for the World Cup. A $700,000 budget and access to MLC venues in Dallas and Morrisville were being arranged to support preparatory fixtures for National Men's, Women's, and Junior programs, including matches against West Indies A and West Indies Women's team in October.The conflict escalated on June 23 when USA Cricket issued a termination warning citing various alleged breaches by ACE. The entity responded in July by addressing these claims point by point, but USA Cricket proceeded with the termination notice without further communication.According to documents reviewed by Cricbuzz, only two claims qualify as material breaches under the termination clause: failure to pay yearly minimum guarantees and failure to construct a high-performance centre. Bank records show ACE has maintained quarterly minimum-guarantee payments.In response to the high-performance centre requirements, ACE stated in their July communication that the facility in Grand Prairie was developed in consultation with USA Cricket leadership. They noted that it "exceeds the standards of high performance centres of most other ICC Associate nations, and has even been deemed of sufficient standard for the ICC to conduct World Cup matches in 2024."Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

'You don’t talk, rookie': Ex-Australia batter recalls Virat Kohli’s fiery reply on his Test debut

Joe Burns recalls his debut Boxing Day Test in 2014 against India, where a brief attempt to sledge Virat Kohli backfired spectacularly. Kohli, then emerging as India's Test captain, silenced Burns with a sharp retort and a boundary. Burns learned a valuable lesson about engaging with the fierce competitor, whose leadership shaped India's aggressive cricketing identity.

Joe Burns recalls his debut Boxing Day Test in 2014 against India, where a brief attempt to sledge Virat Kohli backfired spectacularly. Kohli, then emerging as India's Test captain, silenced Burns with a sharp retort and a boundary. Burns learned a valuable lesson about engaging with the fierce competitor, whose leadership shaped India's aggressive cricketing identity. Virat Kohli (X) Former Australia batter and current Italy captain Joe Burns recently shared his experience of encountering Virat Kohli during the 2014-15 Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, where Kohli delivered a sharp response to Burns’ attempt at sledging during his debut match. The incident took place during India’s tour of Australia, which also marked Kohli’s emergence as India’s Test leader following MS Dhoni’s retirement after the Melbourne Test. During the Boxing Day clash, Australia had posted 530 runs, and India’s reply was led by Kohli’s brilliant 169. Burns, who was fielding at bat-pad, recalled trying to engage with Kohli after staying silent for four hours.How Virat Kohli & Ravi Shastri sparked India's Test revolution | Insights from Bharat Arun | #BSEGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! “In my first game, first Test match at the MCG on Boxing Day, I was 24. I was fielding at bat-pad (close to the batter). Virat scored a hundred that day. There was a bit of chirp going on, not sledging, just the usual with Hadzi (Brad Haddin) behind the stumps and Watto (Shane Watson) at first slip. Nathan Lyon was bowling and I was in close. After four hours of silence, I finally said one line to him: ‘Virat, you’ve got to play some shots,’” Burns recounted. Kohli’s response was immediate and unforgettable. Burns described the moment: “He stopped Nathan Lyon mid-run, turned to me and said, ‘You don’t talk, rookie.’ The very next ball, he smacked it through covers. It was very embarrassing for me. I didn’t say a word for the next four days, but it showed me Virat was not someone to mess with. As a 24-year-old debutant at bat-pad, I realised I picked the wrong player and the wrong time to speak,” he told CricTracker.PollWhich aspect of Kohli's game do you admire the most?His batting skillsHis leadership qualitiesHis competitive nature The 2014-15 tour proved significant for Kohli, who amassed 692 runs in eight innings, including four centuries. The series cemented his leadership credentials as he stepped in for Dhoni, who missed the first match and later announced his retirement. Reflecting on Kohli’s impact, Burns said: “Virat Kohli doesn’t take a backward step. He really shaped that team’s identity. Even now, when he’s not in the team, you can see India still play in the mould of what he built over the years. He was always a fierce competitor. Personally, I tried not to look at him on the field because I knew that spurred him on.” Burns, who recently led Italy to their maiden T20 World Cup qualification, added: “I didn’t want to engage with him because he thrived on that. He’s a world-class batter, one of the greatest of all time. That combination of skill and competitiveness defined him, and it set the tone for Indian cricket.” Kohli’s career statistics underline his greatness, with 9,230 runs in 123 Test matches. The incident with Burns during the Boxing Day Test was a small but telling example of Kohli’s ability to respond to challenges with both words and performance.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

'Jaiswal is better than Gill'- Ex India batter sparks selection debate

The selection of India's Asia Cup 2025 squad is creating controversy. Yashasvi Jaiswal is surprisingly left out. Shubman Gill makes a comeback to the T20I team. He is also appointed as the vice-captain. Experts are questioning Jaiswal's exclusion despite his strong performance. Sai Sudharsan's omission is also raising concerns. Subramaniam Badrinath highlights potential recency bias in the selection process.

The selection of India's Asia Cup 2025 squad is creating controversy. Yashasvi Jaiswal is surprisingly left out. Shubman Gill makes a comeback to the T20I team. He is also appointed as the vice-captain. Experts are questioning Jaiswal's exclusion despite his strong performance. Sai Sudharsan's omission is also raising concerns. Subramaniam Badrinath highlights potential recency bias in the selection process.  Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal India’s Asia Cup 2025 squad has stirred debate after the omission of star opener Yashasvi Jaiswal, leaving fans and former cricketers questioning the selection choices. Shubman Gill returns to the T20I squad for the first time since July 2024, and the BCCI has handed him the vice-captaincy role, a clear sign of faith in the youngster’s leadership. Jaiswal, who has been a key figure in India’s T20 set-up, was named among the reserve players despite his impressive record. He has scored 723 runs in 23 T20Is, including a century and five fifties at a strike rate of over 164. In the IPL 2025, he continued his excellent form, scoring 559 runs in 14 matches with six half-centuries at a strike rate of 160. His omission has raised eyebrows among cricket experts.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Former Chennai Super Kings player Subramaniam Badrinath weighed in on the decision, calling it a positive move to back Shubman Gill, but questioning the rationale behind leaving out players like Jaiswal and Sai Sudharsan.“I see this mostly as a positive that they are backing a youngster and projecting him for the future. But what about Yashasvi Jaiswal? He has done even better than Shubman Gill. Also, why has Sai Sudharsan missed out after scoring 700 runs in IPL 2025 and performing better than Shubman Gill? Sanju Samson himself is now in doubt to start in the playing 11,” Badrinath said on his YouTube channel.PollDo you agree with the exclusion of Yashasvi Jaiswal from India's Asia Cup 2025 squad?Yes, it was the right decision.No, he should have been included. Badrinath further questioned whether the selection was influenced by recency bias, a trend often seen in Indian cricket where players performing well in the immediate past are preferred, even if their overall numbers are stronger. He added, “So while backing Shubman Gill, you ask what wrong have Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sai Sudharsan done when their numbers are better than Gill’s. It’s not a bad decision but one that’s 50-50.”While Shubman Gill’s leadership and experience are valued, many feel that Yashasvi Jaiswal’s consistency and impact make him deserving of a more prominent role. Most likely, India will open the innings with Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma, leaving the middle order to accommodate other key batters, including Sanju Samson, who may have to adapt to a new role.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Centurion is scheduled to host the Eliminator on Thursday, January 22, while the Wanderers in Johannesburg will stage Qualifier 2 the following day, which decides the second finalist. All previous SA20 finals have been played in front of capacity crowds, and League Commissioner Graeme Smith expects that trend to continue. “SA20 Season 4 is shaping up to be an incredibly exciting summer of cricket, kicking off on Boxing Day and running through the holiday period,” Smith said. “Last year Newlands sold out all five matches at the venue and with the Final taking place on a Sunday, it sets up an incredible afternoon with great weather, entertainment and a lively atmosphere to crown our Season 4 Champions.” Smith also highlighted Durban’s new role in the Playoffs. “Durban will host a Playoff for the first time and we’re hoping this will excite the fans, especially because the two best teams of the competition will be playing in that Qualifier 1,” he said. “We’re also excited to go back to Centurion and Wanderers on the Thursday and Friday nights, it’s always key to have the venues close together because the matches are a day apart.” The Commissioner admitted scheduling the knockout stages is always a challenge given the short turnaround after the group phase. “It's always an interesting challenge for us to get the scheduling of the Playoff matches done and done well. Especially after an exciting Group Match stage that finishes two days before the first Playoff match. I am looking forward to seeing who will be competing.”PollDo you think Durban hosting a Playoff for the first time will attract more fans?Yes, definitelyNo, it won't make a difference The announcement of the Final and Playoff venues comes ahead of the Season 4 Player Auction on September 9, when the six franchises will complete their 19-player squads.

SUBSCRIBE NOW!Playing for St Kitts and Nevis Patriots, Rizwan managed only 3 runs before being dismissed by spinner Jomel Warrican. Attempting a sweep, he missed the turn completely, lost his balance, fell to the ground, and saw his stumps shattered. The dismissal drew laughter from players on the field and even from the opposition dressing room. He was badly trolled on social media as well. Champions Trophy: 'India put in more effort, were braver than us,' admits Mohammad RizwanA dejected Rizwan shook his head in disappointment as he walked back to the pavilion.Earlier, the PCB had scrapped the top category of its central contracts after a series of poor results, demoting former captains Babar Azam and Rizwan to category B for the first time since the system was introduced 21 years ago.Despite being among Pakistan’s biggest cricketing names, both Azam and Rizwan lost their places in the T20I squads for the upcoming tri-series and Asia Cup following inconsistent performances over the past year.Joining them in category B are T20I captain Salman Agha, Fakhar Zaman, Abrar Ahmed, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Saim Ayub, Shadab Khan, and Shaheen Shah Afridi. Meanwhile, Test skipper Shan Masood was pushed further down, from category B to D.Pakistan’s decline has been stark across formats.

'He backs players he likes': Gambhir questioned over Shreyas Iyer snub

Sadagoppan Ramesh has ignited controversy by alleging that Gautam Gambhir didn't support Shreyas Iyer's Asia Cup inclusion, despite Iyer's stellar form, including a strong IPL and Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy performance.

Gautam Gambhir (AFP Photo) NEW DELHI: Former India opener Sadagoppan Ramesh has alleged that head coach Gautam Gambhir did not support Shreyas Iyer’s inclusion in the Asia Cup squad, despite the batter’s outstanding form in recent tournaments.

Yet, Gambhir is not backing him. Someone like Jaiswal, who is an X-factor player, must play all formats. Keeping him in standby is a poor move," Ramesh added.The former opener stressed that Iyer’s form and confidence made him indispensable to India’s white-ball setup."Shreyas Iyer produced incredible performances in the same UAE during the Champions Trophy and should be a permanent fixture in India's white-ball teams.

'Reimagined' US Open mixed doubles was a success but Errani- Vavassori complete 'mission'

The US Open mixed doubles event had many winners - Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori as champions while carrying the mantle for the doubles specialists. And the USTA in bringing thousands of fans to an otherwise ignored competition. But teething problems cannot be ignored.

The US Open mixed doubles event had many winners - Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori as champions while carrying the mantle for the doubles specialists. And the USTA in bringing thousands of fans to an otherwise ignored competition. But teething problems cannot be ignored. Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori kiss the trophy after winning the revamped US Open mixed doubles title. (AP) When Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori stepped on to the court at Flushing Meadows, they weren’t just defending their US Open mixed doubles title. They were fighting for doubles specialists everywhere as the event had been overhauled into a 16-team ‘spectacle’ starring singles superstars, backed by $1 million prize money and a radical Fast4 tennis format.Unseeded and wildcards Errani and Vavassori were injected into a field that had numerous headline acts. Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner, Aryna Sabalenka (both withdrew), Novak Djokovic, Taylor Fritz, Iga Swiatek, Emma Raducanu, Jessica Pegula and Madison Keys were some of the big names involved.But the winners were still to be crowned Grand Slam champions and that’s what irked doubles specialists who couldn't be part of the event and not by choice.Unsurprisingly, there was an outcry. Jamie Murray dismissed it as "a glorified exhibition." Errani-Vavassori had said in a joint statement that it was "pseudo-exhibition" and “profound injustice” which “disrespect(s) an entire category of players.”Rather hilariously, Casper Ruud, who has lost three major singles finals, was positioned as someone chasing their maiden Grand Slam title."I know it created a lot of reaction and [it was] somewhat bold to do it," said Ruud on United States Tennis Association's (USTA) move to upend the event that gets largely ignored otherwise. "You can't argue that it's not been great for the fans."Casper Ruud plays with Iga Swiatek during the mixed doubles final at the US Open tennis championships. (AP)If the objective was to draw fans, bring attention to the event that otherwise gets lost and ignored and get viewers hooked to the TV, one can reasonably argue that the goal has been met.But at what cost? The 138-year tradition was ripped apart. As was the chance for many doubles specialists to win a major tournament, including this year's Wimbledon champions Sam Verbeek and Katerina Siniakova. To add to the injustice of it all, doubles World No. 2 Siniakova was withdrawn from the draw at the last minute when her partner Sinner pulled out late. By then, she had skipped Cleveland to play the US Open.In the end, as far as polarising narratives go, the final offered another one. Doubles specialists vs singles specialists. It has been one of the raging arguments in the sport and rarely is it answered with much at stake. And here we were, with plenty riding on it.Sara Errani plays with Andrea Vavassori during the mixed doubles semi-final at the US Open tennis championships. (AP)Both Ruud and Swiatek found it challenging to deal with Errani's 70mph serve as Vavassori moved about at the net to cause distraction. At one point in the second set, Ruud and Swiatek were both guilty of shanking three consecutive forehand returns.Australia's Ellen Perez, a doubles specialist herself, said she had "never felt more Italian" as she supported them.The moment Vavassori landed an unpickable return on Swiatek's feet after a 92-minute match, the doubles community had been vindicated. “This is for all the doubles players who couldn’t play this tournament,” Errani said. Vavassori added: “We have been on a mission.”"We showed that doubles is a great product and in the future we need more marketing and visibility," Vavassori shot out at the US Open decision-makers.Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu celebrate during their mixed doubles match at the US Open tennis championships. (AP)But the success of the two-day doubles showdown, where singles players seemingly enjoyed, Louis Armstrong and Arthur Ashe Stadium were used and DJs worked overtime, could mean USTA sticks by this structure instead of tinkering with it and introducing more doubles teams for the future.Jack Draper and Karolina Muchova called it an 'exhibition' - a word that is disparagingly used by athletes. On the opening day, it appeared to be the case. With two courts in use, giant screens showing the other match as well and attention being dragged, the quality felt laboured. The semi-finals and final turned that notion around with a more serious feel to it.PollHow do you feel about the decision to feature singles players in the mixed doubles event?It's a great idea for visibility.It undermines doubles specialists.It should remain separate.If the US Open continues with the mixed doubles event for the future, it must come with some much-needed changes. As far as the playing field is concerned, bringing in champions from three other majors could be an idea worth exploring to not just address the concerns of the doubles specialists but also make things even more interesting on the doubles vs singles quotient.Additionally, the tournament needs better organisation and coordination. Sabalenka and Gauff pulled out to hurt the hype train. Cincinnati Open finished mere hours before the mixed event got underway in New York and an ill Sinner withdrew while Swiatek barely made it in time.Caty McNally had just 60 seconds to agree to a partner. “Sunday night I was home in Cincinnati and my agent called me, and he said you have 60 seconds to tell me if you want to play with Lorenzo Musetti.”Many teams didn't even practice together before taking to court, which could explain the comic point involving Andrey Rublev and Muchova. Naomi Osaka played her first round match, alongside Gael Monfils, in a practice kit.The obvious exceptions to this all were the Italians Errani and Vavassori who needed 42, 56, 44 and 92 minutes, respectively, to win the title. It is worth reminding that the duo, who have won 12 major titles, were unseeded and needed a wildcard to get in.As the beaten finalist Swiatek said: “You proved that mixed doubles players are smarter tactically than singles players, I guess.”For now, as far as mic drop moments go, Errani and Vavassori had delivered it - embarrassed the US Open organisers, successfully defended their title against the best singles players in the world and walked off with a cool million dollars.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Ashwin defended himself, while recalling Mitchell Starc's playful reference to the video during the Indore Test. R Ashwin and Rahul Dravid  NEW DELHI: Former India head coach Rahul Dravid and senior spinner Ravichandran Ashwin revisited a controversial moment from the 2023 Border-Gavaskar Trophy during the latest episode of Kutti Stories with Ash. The incident revolved around Ashwin facing backlash for allegedly helping Australia through a Tamil-language YouTube video on playing spin in India.The controversy erupted after Ashwin uploaded the video following Australia’s defeat in the second Test. The criticism intensified when India lost the third Test at Indore, with social media users accusing Ashwin of “coaching” the opposition. The channel was eventually forced to change the video’s thumbnail.Rahul Dravid reflects on RR's narrow losses: 'One or two hits away in every game'Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Dravid light-heartedly brought up the episode with Ashwin."You even coached the Australian team. I got sent a clip. Unfortunately, it was in Tamil. So that's the one I've seen about you. You're speaking in Tamil and with a little bit of Tamil that I understand, you're coaching the Australian team in the middle of the Australian series, how to play spin. And I'm thinking, Ash, the series is not over," Dravid said.Ashwin responded in his defence: "If I knew how to do that, I would have told our boys how to play spin. I mean, why would I go and tell the Aussies?"Dravid admitted he was joking but also revealed he too had faced flak at the time. "The flak I got was 'Ashwin is coaching better than you are — what are you doing?'" he said with a laugh.PollDo you think Ashwin's YouTube video gave Australia an unfair advantage?Yes, it definitely helped themNo, it was just a learning resourceAshwin also recalled a conversation with Mitchell Starc during the Indore Test: "An interesting thing was that (Mitchell) Starc came and told me. I mean, he bowled a bumper, and I just left it in the Indore Test match. I think we were 80 for 7 or something. We went for lunch, and he was walking with me. He was like, 'Can I tell you how to play the bouncer like your YouTube video?'"Dravid further joked that the Australians might have found a translator: "It's good to know that Starc knows Tamil. I think it was maybe the Australian guys got some Tamil guy to sort of..." he said, before Ashwin clarified that the video carried subtitles.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Mirabai Chanu shifts scales: Fresh weight class, revamped game plan

Saikhom Mirabai Chanu is strategically adapting her training for the women’s 48kg category after the International Weightlifting Federation's rule changes. Her regimen includes a revised diet, evenly distributed workload, and enhanced recovery methods like massages and ice baths. Chanu aims to excel at the Commonwealth Weightlifting Championship and the 2026 Asian Games.

Her regimen includes a revised diet, evenly distributed workload, and enhanced recovery methods like massages and ice baths. Chanu aims to excel at the Commonwealth Weightlifting Championship and the 2026 Asian Games. PARIS, FRANCE - AUGUST 07: Mirabai Chanu Saikhom of Team India (Photo by Lars Baron/Getty Images) In the high-stakes world of weightlifting, where every gram and every lift matters, Saikhom Mirabai Chanu is leaving nothing to chance. Ahead of the Commonwealth Weightlifting Championship in Ahmedabad, which serves as a qualifier for next year’s Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, the star lifter from Manipur has undertaken a comprehensive overhaul of her training regimen. With renewed focus on diet, recovery and workload management, the 31-year-old is embracing a change prompted by an overhaul in international competition rules. In June, the International Weightlifting Federation revised its weight categories, scrapping the women’s 49kg division — a class in which Mirabai has competed for the past seven years, and in which she famously won silver at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. She also holds the clean and jerk world record in that category, lifting 119kg at the 2021 Asian Championship. AI-generated audio summary; not verified by the edit team.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Now, Mirabai returns to the women’s 48kg category — a division where she first announced her arrival on the global stage by winning silver at the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games. In many ways, it’s a homecoming of sorts, but one that demands significant physical and strategic adaptation. “While it may seem like just a 1kg drop, it takes a serious toll on the body,” her long-time coach, Vijay Sharma, told TOI. “We had the option to move up to 53kg or come down to 48kg. We chose the latter as it better suits her natural weight.” Sharma and assistant coach-cum-dietician AP Datthan went back to the drawing board two months ago to completely rewire Mirabai’s training strategy, aiming to maximize her performance without risking injury. Rather than pushing her through heavy single-session lifts, her daily load — totaling around 12 to 14 tonnes — is now spread evenly throughout the day. “This method keeps each workout manageable and gives her body time to recover properly,” said Sharma. “Recovery is the key. Spreading the workload helps her adapt better, stay fresh and maintain strength,” he elaborated. Dathan has calibrated Mirabai’s diet, increasing her protein intake to aid muscle repair and prevent muscle loss, while reducing carbohydrates. “High-protein foods like lean meat, eggs, lentils and dairy feature prominently, with complex carbs like whole grains and vegetables,” Dathan said. Recovery strategies extend beyond training and nutrition. Mirabai now undergoes regular massages, ice baths and sauna treatment at least twice a week to reduce inflammation and ease muscle soreness, supported by a dedicated female masseuse. With her support team’s unwavering attention to detail, Mirabai is optimistic about her prospects in the new weight category. Following the Commonwealth Weightlifting Championship in Ahmedabad, she will gear up for the World Championships in October. While the Commonwealth Games remains vital to her plans, Mirabai is focused on the 2026 Asian Games in Japan — the only major multi-sport event where she is yet to win a medal. Injuries derailed her campaigns at both the 2018 and 2023 editions, making this event the elusive goal.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4. Watch Here!

‘I would like to see Samson play, but…’ – Former India captain on Team India’s playing XI

With Shubman Gill's return as vice-captain for the Asia Cup 2025, India's opening combination is under scrutiny. Ajinkya Rahane anticipates Gill partnering with Abhishek Sharma, despite Sanju Samson's strong form. Rahane also expressed excitement about the pace duo of Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh.

With Shubman Gill's return as vice-captain for the Asia Cup 2025, India's opening combination is under scrutiny. Ajinkya Rahane anticipates Gill partnering with Abhishek Sharma, despite Sanju Samson's strong form. Rahane also expressed excitement about the pace duo of Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh. Sanju Samson (x) With Shubman Gill returning to the Indian squad for the upcoming Asia Cup 2025, the focus has shifted to India’s opening combination. Both Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma have been in excellent form, scoring freely and keeping the tempo high. However, the inclusion of Gill, who has been named vice-captain, could see one of them making way. Former India captain Ajinkya Rahane believes Gill and Abhishek are most likely to open in the tournament. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Rahane said, “Shubman is back in the team, I’m sure he is most likely to open with Abhishek Sharma. Personally, I would like to see Sanju Samson in the team because he has done really well. He is a very confident guy, a very good team man, and that is very important.”Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Rahane added that while Samson brings great value to the side, it is probable he might miss out. “Sanju is a great team man, but that is a very good problem to have for the team management. In my opinion, probably Sanju Samson will sit out, though as I said, I would like him to play and be in the playing XI. But Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma will open the innings for the team.” The former cricketer also highlighted his excitement about India’s pace attack. “I’m really excited to see Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh bowling together in this Asia Cup. We all know how dangerous Bumrah is. Arshdeep swings the ball both ways and can deliver both straight and wide yorkers,” Rahane explained.PollDo you agree with Ajinkya Rahane's predicted opening combination of Gill and Abhishek?Yes, it's the best choiceNo, they should include Samson He further noted that the final spot in the XI will depend on conditions in Dubai. “Depending on the wicket, it will either be Varun Chakaravarthy or Harshit Rana.” Rahane’s predicted XI: Shubman Gill, Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma, Suryakumar Yadav (C), Hardik Pandya, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy/Harshit Rana.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

One-dayers remain an unsolved puzzle for Shafali Verma

Shafali Verma, after leading India to U-19 World Cup glory, faced a setback, getting dropped from the ODI World Cup squad due to inconsistent performances. Despite domestic success and WPL flair, she struggles in ODIs, averaging just 23. Pratika Rawal replaced her, capitalizing on opportunities.

Shafali Verma, after leading India to U-19 World Cup glory, faced a setback, getting dropped from the ODI World Cup squad due to inconsistent performances. Despite domestic success and WPL flair, she struggles in ODIs, averaging just 23. Pratika Rawal replaced her, capitalizing on opportunities. Shafali Verma (Photo by Chris Hyde/Getty Images) Chennai: In Jan 2023, when Shafali Verma hoisted the Under-19 Women’s T20 World Cup trophy in South Africa, with tears of joy, she said: “This is just the beginning.” The journey from that “beginning,” though, turned far bumpier than the young opening batter could have imagined, culminating in her getting dropped from the India squad for the ODI World Cup at home starting in September.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! With lean returns in ODIs and a dismal show at home against New Zealand, the axe fell in Nov last year. Shafali was dropped from the ODI squad for the Australia tour and remained out of favour. Her last half-century came in 2022. When the door closed, Shafali turned to domestic cricket and emerged as the leading run-scorer in a format that has troubled her the most. She piled up 527 runs at a strike rate of 152.31 in the One-dayers for Haryana, including a 197 off 115 balls. In March, donning Delhi Capitals jersey in the WPL, she finished as the fourth-highest run-getter overall. In July this year, Shafali roared back in Indian colours and showed flashes of her swagger during the T20I series in England. For all her flair in the shortest format, ODIs remain Shafali’s unsolved puzzle. The batter has managed an average of 23 in 29 matches, and on the recent India A tour of Australia, her performance was underwhelming. So, when her name went missing from the upcoming home ODI World Cup squad, it hardly raised eyebrows. In her place came Pratika Rawal, who made her debut last year, and has made her case with steady returns at an average of 54. The 21-year-old Shafali needs to crack the 50-over format, according to WV Raman, who was India women’s head coach when a 15-year-old Shafali first broke into the scene. Shafali was India’s leading run-getter in the 2020 T20 World Cup, a campaign where India went all the way to the final under Raman’s watch. “She has to work her way back into the team by working on her shortcomings. Basically, she needs to put up consistent performances in the 50-over format as Pratika has grabbed her opportunities and displaced Shafali.PollDo you think Shafali Verma will make a successful comeback to the ODI squad?Yes, she has the talentNo, she needs more timeI’m not sure “The other area that needs improvement is her fielding. What is important is for her is to fight her way back into the team. And she was given a fair bit of leeway when she started. A setback is always good to make a strong comeback,” Raman told TOI. Shafali, who as a kid once walked into an under-12 all-boys local tournament and walked out with the ‘Man of the Match’ and ‘Man of the Series’ medal, has always carried the same audacity to the international stage. Today, even as she faces the first big setback of her international career, the fierce and spunky prodigy still has age and time to turn things around. Shantha Rangaswamy, former chief selector, is confident of Shafali’s comeback. “She’s very talented but she needs to score consistently. Unless she does that, it won’t be fair to drop Pratika, who has done very well. My advice to her is: ‘You (Shafali) have age on your side, you are a talented cricketer, you just need to keep building scores consistently.’ I feel she will definitely make a comeback, because she is a huge talent,” said Shantha, the first captain of the Indian women’s cricket team.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
