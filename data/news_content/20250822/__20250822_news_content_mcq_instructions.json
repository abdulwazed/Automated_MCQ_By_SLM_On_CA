        "input": "Union Home Minister Amit Shah criticized the Congress-led India bloc's Vice President candidate, B. Sudershan Reddy, accusing him of supporting Naxalism through his Salwa Judum judgment. Shah claimed that this judgment delayed the end of Naxal terrorism and diminished Congress's chances in Kerala.  NEW DELHI: If the Congress-led India bloc's Vice President candidate, B Sudershan Reddy, had not delivered the Salwa Judum judgment, the extremist Left movement in the country would have ended before 2020, Union home minister and senior BJP leader Amit Shah on Friday accused his of \"supporting\" Naxalism.Speaking after inaugurating the Manorama News conclave organised by the Malayala Manorama group in Delhi, Shah remarked that the Congress party\u2019s chances of winning in Kerala had further diminished due to its choice of candidate for the Vice-President post.Why INDIA Bloc Chose Justice Sudershan Reddy as Its Vice President Pick Against NDA's Radhakrishnan \"Sudershan Reddy is the person who helped Naxalism. He gave Salwa Judum judgment. If the Salwa Judum judgment had not been given, the Naxal terrorism would have ended by 2020. He is the person who was inspired by the ideology that gave Salwa Judum judgment,\" PTI quoted Shah said during a question-and-answer session at the conclave. The statement refers to the December 2011 Supreme Court judgment by Justice Reddy, which ruled that using tribal youths as Special Police Officers\u2014whether called 'Koya Commandos', Salwa Judum, or by any other name\u2014in the fight against Maoist insurgents was illegal and unconstitutional, ordering their immediate disarmament. Shah added that Kerala had borne the brunt of Naxalism. \"People of Kerala will certainly see that the Congress party, under the pressure of Left parties, is fielding a candidate who supported Naxalism and used a pious forum like the Supreme Court,\" he asserted. The ruling NDA had selected Maharashtra Governor C P Radhakrishnan, a seasoned BJP leader from Tamil Nadu with an RSS background, as its vice-presidential candidate. What was Salwa Judam judgment?In 2011, Reddy gave a landmark judgment which declared the controversial Salwa Judum militia in Chhattisgarh as unconstitutional. The Salwa Judum, which was accused of human rights abuses, was a state-sponsored militia raised in 2005 to counter Maoist insurgency. It comprised largely tribal youth armed with basic training and firearms. The militia was later disbanded. His ruling, rooted in the protection of fundamental rights, underscored that state-sponsored vigilantism could not replace constitutional policing. In Nandini Sundar versus state of Chhattisgarh, the bench led by Justice Reddy held that arming tribal youth as special police officers under Salwa Judum was illegal and unconstitutional.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

On the other hand, some political parties submitted that the BLAs are not being permitted to submit their objections,\" the bench noted.The Supreme Court is dealing with a bunch of petitions challenging poll body special intensive revision of Bihar's electoral rolls ahead of the state's assembly elections. The next hearing is scheduled for September 8.On August 14, the top court directed the poll panel to publish by August 19 details of the 65 lakh voters excluded from the draft electoral rolls in poll-bound Bihar to enhance \"transparency\" .Observing that the EC should put at rest the \u201cnarrative being built\u201d against it, the bench had also ordered that the details should include reasons for their non-inclusion during the ongoing SIR exercise. \"Transparency will create voter confidence.\"The revision of the voters\u2019 list in Bihar--the first since 2003--has sparked a huge political row.

        "input": "The Supreme Court has revised its order regarding stray dogs in Delhi-NCR, permitting the release of sterilised, immunised, and dewormed dogs back to their original locations, except for those with rabies or aggressive tendencies. The court also banned public feeding, mandating designated feeding zones, and extended the ruling nationwide, directing compliance with ABC Rules and planning a unified national policy.  NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday reversed the August 11 order on the relocation of stray dogs in Delhi-NCR, saying that the animals that are not rabid or aggressive will not be shifted to shelters but instead sterilised, immunised, and released back to their original locations.The court said that the \"direction given in the order dated 11th August, 2025, prohibiting the release of the treated and vaccinated dogs seems to be too harsh.\" It referenced Rule 11(9) of the ABC Rules, which mandates that once stray dogs have been sterilised, inoculated, and dewormed, they must be released back into the same locality from which they were picked up. A three-judge bench comprising Justice Vikram Nath, Justice Sandeep Mehta, and Justice NV Anjaria clarified that stray dogs must be released to their original areas after sterilisation, deworming, and immunisation, except for those infected with rabies, suspected of rabies infection, or exhibiting aggressive behaviour.Here are top quotes:\"The provision in Rule 11(19) that the dogs, upon sterilisation and immunisation, should be relocated to the same locality from which they have been picked up, is scientifically carved out inasmuch as it serves two purposes. Firstly, the same prevents the scope of overcrowding in the dog shelters/pounds, and secondly, the picked-up stray dogs after immunisation and sterilisation are relocated to the same environment where they were living earlier, which is a compassionate treatment,\" the court said.\"The aggressive sterilisation would definitely put a curb on the rapid growth of the stray dog population, ultimately leading to its reduction. However, this is possible only in an idealistic situation, which seems unlikely in the present scenario,\" the court said.The court said, \"It was argued by some of the counsels appearing for the animal lovers that the process of sterilisation and inoculation has worked wonders in many towns across the country and has significantly brought down the population of stray dogs. To be specific, it was pointed out that towns like Dehradun and Lucknow, which have taken aggressive measures for sterilisation, etc., as per the ABC Rules, have seen a steady decline in the population of stray dogs. A suggestion has also been received that chemical castration is a safe, painless, and effective mode of sterilisation.\"\"A blanket direction to pick up all the strays and place them in dog shelters/pounds without evaluating the existing infrastructure may lead to a catch-22 situation because such directions may be impossible to comply with. We, therefore, feel that a holistic approach requires mollification of the directions issued vide order dated 11th August, 2025,\" the court said.The court also ordered a ban on public feeding of stray dogs and directed the establishment of dedicated feeding spaces. The Bench reiterated the August 11 order that no individual or organisation should obstruct municipal authorities from picking up dogs in accordance with the ABC Rules.The scope of the matter was extended beyond Delhi-NCR to a pan-India level, involving all States and Union Territories, Secretaries of Animal Husbandry departments, Secretaries of local bodies, and Municipal corporations for compliance with ABC Rules. The court also stated that it would transfer similar petitions pending in high courts to itself to formulate a national policy on the issue.The Supreme Court has supplemented and modified earlier directions on stray dog management, laying down fresh guidelines for municipal bodies:  Municipal authorities must continue complying with previous directions, but the bar on releasing picked-up strays has been kept in abeyance. Stray dogs are to be sterilised, dewormed, vaccinated, and then released in the same area, except in cases of rabies or aggressive behaviour. Such dogs must be kept in shelters after treatment.   Each municipal ward must establish designated feeding zones for stray dogs. Feeding on streets is prohibited, with violators facing legal action. Helplines are to be set up for reporting violations.   No individual or organisation may obstruct officials implementing these directions; obstruction will invite prosecution.   NGOs involved in the case must deposit Rs 2 lakh each, while individual dog lovers must deposit Rs 25,000 each, within seven days. These funds will be used for stray-dog infrastructure.   Citizens may formally adopt stray dogs through municipal bodies, ensuring adopted dogs do not return to the streets.   Municipalities must file compliance affidavits, detailing available facilities such as dog pounds, vets, capture staff, and vehicles.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The court directed the ECI to allow excluded voters to file claims online and offline, accepting Aadhaar as a valid ID.  NEW DELHI: Congress on Friday welcomed the Supreme Court's verdict on the Bihar Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, claiming that the Election Commission of India (ECI) stands \"totally exposed and discredited.\"Congress general secretary in-charge of communications, Jairam Ramesh, in a post on X, welcomed the ruling, saying that the democracy had survived a \"brutal assault\" from the EC.\"The INC welcomes today's verdict of the Supreme Court on the Bihar SIR issue. Democracy has survived a brutal assault from the Election Commission of India (ECI). On August 14th, the Supreme Court had intervened to set aside the ECI's decision to withhold the list of deleted voters. The Supreme Court had directed that the list of deleted voters must be published ALONG WITH the reasons for such deletions,\" Jairam posted on X.\"Today, the ECI stands totally exposed and discredited. Its G2 puppeteers stand decisively defeated,\" he added.Congress' remarks came after the Supreme Court directed the ECI to allow excluded voters to file their claims both online and offline during the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in poll-bound Bihar.Ramesh further noted that on August 14, the top court had already struck down the ECI\u2019s move to withhold the list of deleted voters and ordered its publication along with reasons for deletions.\"On August 14th, the Supreme Court had also directed the ECI to accept Aadhar cards as proof of identity for those deleted.

Today, the Supreme Court has laid down guardrails to make the revision more inclusive by including political parties in the process,\" the Congress leader posted.Taking aim at the poll body\u2019s functioning, Ramesh added, \"So far the ECI's approach has been obstructionist and contrary to the interests of the voters. We welcome this judgment especially because it gives us an enforceable right which the ECI cannot ignore.\"Earlier in the day, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi also ruled that claim forms could be submitted with an Aadhaar number or any one of the 11 recognised identity documents.Noting with concern that political parties had not filed objections regarding the exclusion of nearly 65 lakh voters, the Court directed the Chief Electoral Officer of Bihar to include them as parties to the proceedings.\"We will allow online submission of claims of deleted voters with Aadhaar card or any other acceptable documents for Bihar SIR,\" the bench said, as quoted by PTI.\"All the political parties shall file the status report by the next date of hearing on the claim form they had facilitated in filing by excluded voters,\" the bench added.The matter has been posted for hearing on September 8.Meanwhile, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for the ECI, requested the Court to grant the poll panel 15 days to establish that no wrongful exclusions had taken place.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The top court also said that claim forms can be submitted along with Aadhaar card or any other 11 acceptable documents.\"We will allow online submission of claims of deleted voters with Aadhaar card or any other acceptable documents for Bihar SIR,\" the bench said, as quoted by PTI.\"All the political parties shall file the status report by the next date of hearing on the claim form they had facilitated in filing by excluded voters,\" the bench added.The matter has been posted for hearing on September 8.During the hearing, the Election Commission informed the court that while 85,000 new voters had been added in the ongoing revision, only two objections had been filed by booth-level agents of political parties.PollDo you think the voter list revision in Bihar is being handled effectively?Yes, the process is transparent and fairNo, more needs to be done to include all votersA bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi resumed hearing a batch of petitions challenging the SIR exercise. The petitions were filed by RJD MP Manoj Jha, the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), PUCL, activist Yogendra Yadav, Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra and former Bihar MLA Mujahid Alam.The petitioners have sought to quash the ECI\u2019s June 24 directive, which requires large numbers of voters in Bihar to submit proof of citizenship to stay on the rolls. What happened earlierOn August 14, Election Commission uploaded details of 65 lakh deleted voters from Bihar\u2019s draft electoral rolls on district magistrates\u2019 websites, following a Supreme Court order. Chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar said the move was made \u201cwithin 56 hours of the top court directive\u201d to ensure transparency. He explained that Electoral Registration Officers and Booth Level Officers bear responsibility for the accuracy of rolls, which are shared digitally and physically with parties and the public. Draft rolls in Bihar, published on August 1, remain open for claims and objections until September 1.Defending the exercise, Kumar said it was a \u201cmatter of grave concern\u201d that some parties were spreading \u201cmisinformation\u201d, stressing that India\u2019s election system is a \u201cmulti-layered, decentralised construct as envisaged by law.\u201dDuring the previous hearing, the Supreme Court said it could set aside the results of the special intensive revision if illegality was proven. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, for RJD MP Manoj Jha, argued the exclusion of 65 lakh voters was unlawful, while Prashant Bhushan accused the EC of making the rolls non-searchable. The court countered claims about lack of documents, saying \u201ceverybody possesses some certificate.\u201d The hearing will continue, with the final rolls due on September 30.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

        "input": "The Supreme Court's revised order on stray dogs, hailed by Maneka Gandhi as \"scientific,\" mandates the return of sterilised and vaccinated canines to their original locations, while aggressive or rabid dogs will be sheltered.  NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court\u2019s latest ruling on the treatment of stray dogs has been welcomed as a step forward by animal rights activist and BJP leader Maneka Gandhi, who described it as a \u201cscientific judgement.\u201d The court on Friday modified its earlier order barring the release of stray dogs in Delhi-NCR and directed that the canines, once sterilised, vaccinated and dewormed, be returned to the areas they were picked up from.\u201cI am very happy with this scientific judgement. Relocation and fear are the only reasons for dogs biting. There is no question of releasing dogs infected with rabies,\u201d Gandhi said, hailing the court\u2019s directions. However, she also flagged the absence of a clear standard for identifying dangerous canines. \u201cThe court has not defined what an aggressive dog is. This needs to be defined,\u201d she added.The bench, led by Justice Vikram Nath, clarified that dogs suspected to be rabid or showing aggression would not be released back onto the streets, but instead kept in shelters after sterilisation and immunisation. The court also ordered municipal bodies to create designated feeding areas in every ward, with signboards to indicate where dogs may be fed. \u201cIt is absolutely right (order to create designated feeding areas). They (civic authority) also have to put up signboards for such designated areas,\u201d Gandhi remarked.The ruling comes after widespread protests against the Supreme Court\u2019s August 11 directive to permanently round up stray dogs across Delhi-NCR. The backlash prompted the bench to suspend the earlier restriction, while broadening the scope of the case nationwide to shape a uniform policy. Gandhi pointed to the government\u2019s commitment to strengthening animal control mechanisms, noting, \u201cAs per the order, the municipal corporations will have to set up proper ABC (Animal Birth Control) centres. For the first time in 25 years, the government stated in Parliament that it is allocating Rs 2,500 crores for this program.\u201dAbout the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

He flagged off the Amrit Bharat Express and Buddhist Circuit Train.  NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday hit out at the Opposition during a rally in Gaya, questioning how chief ministers can continue in office even after being jailed while government employees face suspension if imprisoned for more than 50 hours. \u201cIf a government employee is imprisoned for 50 hours, then he loses his job automatically, be it a driver, a clerk or a peon. But a CM, a minister, or even a PM can enjoy staying in the government even from jail... Some time ago, we saw how files were being signed from jail and how government orders were given from jail. If leaders have such an attitude, how can we fight corruption... NDA government has brought a law against corruption, and the Prime Minister also comes under its purview...,\u201d PM Modi said.Opposition accused of shielding leaders The Prime Minister alleged that parties such as Congress, RJD and the Left are opposing new laws to ensure accountability. \u201cOur forefathers, like Rajendra Babu, could not have imagined that those in jail would continue to occupy constitutional positions,\u201d he said, adding that these parties fear scrutiny \u201cas they have committed wrongs and fear the consequences.\u201dPM Modi also accused them of protecting what he called \u201cintruders\u201d for electoral gains. \u201cI had expressed concern about intruders, we can\u2019t allow them to settle and take away rights of country\u2019s youth. We shall ensure they are identified. Congress and RJD are protecting these intruders for vote bank and appeasement. People of Bihar need to be careful about intruders,\u201d he said.Development push worth Rs 13,000 crore Alongside the political attack, PM Modi inaugurated and laid the foundation stone of development projects worth around Rs 13,000 crore across Bihar, covering power, roads, health, urban infrastructure and water supply. He flagged off the Amrit Bharat Express between Gaya and Delhi and the Buddhist Circuit Train between Vaishali and Koderma, saying they would improve connectivity and tourism at Buddhist sites. Urban projects worth Rs 1,260 crore were launched, including sewerage networks in Aurangabad, Jehanabad, Lakhisarai and Jamui, and water supply initiatives in Aurangabad, Bodhgaya and Jehanabad under AMRUT 2.0. In a major infrastructure boost, Modi inaugurated the 8.15 km Aunta-Simaria bridge on NH-31, including a six-lane stretch over the Ganga built at a cost of Rs 1,870 crore. Officials said it will cut detours of over 100 km for heavy vehicles, ease congestion and improve access to Simaria Dham, birthplace of poet Ramdhari Singh Dinkar. The Prime Minister also opened the Bakhtiyarpur\u2013Mokama section of NH-31 worth Rs 1,900 crore, and announced upgrades to the NH-120 Bikramganj\u2013Dawath\u2013Nawanagar\u2013Dumraon section to strengthen rural connectivity. Bihar\u2019s power sector received a major addition with the inauguration of the Rs 6,880 crore Buxar Thermal Power Plant (660x1 MW), expected to meet rising energy demands.Health and sanitation projects In health, PM Modi inaugurated the Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital and Research Centre at Muzaffarpur, equipped with modern oncology facilities, ICUs and labs to provide advanced treatment to patients in Bihar and neighbouring states. He also launched a sewage treatment plant and sewerage network in Munger under Namami Gange, worth Rs 520 crore, aimed at reducing pollution in the Ganga.Hits out at RJD and Congress PM Modi criticised RJD\u2019s governance record: \u201cRemember the condition here during the rule of lantern (RJD). This region was in the clutches of red terror. Cities like Gaya Ji were in darkness during the rule of 'lantern' (RJD)... They had pushed the entire state into darkness. There was no education or employment. So many generations were forced to migrate. RJD considers the people of Bihar only as their vote bank. They want nothing to do with their life, sorrows, or respect.\u201d He also targeted Congress, recalling a past remark: \u201cA Congress CM had said that he will not let people of Bihar enter his state. No one can forget Congress' hate for the people of Bihar. Despite seeing the Congress' misbehaviour with the people of Bihar, the RJD were in deep sleep... NDA is working hard so that the youth of Bihar can get employment here in their state, so that they get respect and they are able to stay with their parents.\u201dOn terrorism and national security Linking Bihar\u2019s legacy to India\u2019s security policy, PM Modi said: \u201cA pledge taken on the soil of Bihar is never left unfulfilled. When there was a terrorist attack in Kashmir\u2019s Pahalgam and our innocent citizens were killed, from this land of Bihar, I had said that terrorists would be crushed. Today the world is witnessing that the pledge taken from Bihar has been fulfilled... Operation Sindoor has drawn a new line in India\u2019s security policy. Now, no one who sends terrorists to attack India will be spared.\u201d \u201cBihar is the land of Chanakya and Chandragupta Maurya. Bihar has stood as the backbone of the country at all times. Every resolve made on this pious land is the strength of the country and doesn't go in vain. When the Pahalgam terror attack happened, I had vowed to reduce the terrorists to dust from this land. The world has seen that resolve getting fulfilled,\u201d he added.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

        "input": "The Supreme Court has modified its order regarding stray dogs in Delhi and NCR, mandating their return to original areas post-sterilization and vaccination, excluding rabid or aggressive animals. This decision follows widespread protests against the initial directive to relocate all strays to shelters.  NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has modified its controversial August 11 order on the removal of stray dogs from Delhi and NCR, clarifying that the animals will be released back into the same areas after sterilisation and immunisation. Dogs infected with rabies or showing aggressive behaviour, however, will not be released and will instead be kept in shelters.The court also barred public feeding of dogs in random areas, instead directing the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) to create designated feeding spots in every ward. Adoption of dogs by animal lovers has also been opened through applications to the MCD.August 11 \u2013 The order that sparked the stormOn 11 August, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan ordered authorities in Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram and Faridabad to ensure all localities were made free of stray dogs. The judges ruled that captured animals should not be released back on the streets.The court insisted its directions were not \u201cdriven by momentary impulse\u201d but after two decades of systematic failure to control the menace of stray dogs. It cited increasing rabies cases, particularly among children, and stressed that the issue struck \u201cat the heart of public safety.\u201dAugust 12 \u2013 Outrage spills onto the streetsJust a day later, protests erupted in Delhi against the order. At Connaught Place, animal lovers staged a demonstration with placards reading \u201cBeware: Kaal Bhairav is watching\u201d and \u201cStop relocation, we stand in solidarity against the SC verdict.\u201dClashes broke out with police, who detained about 15 activists. Many were seen in tears, calling the order \u201cchildish\u201d and \u201cunworkable.\u201d Nikhil Mahesh of Umeed for Animals Foundation said, \u201cYou need an immense land bank\u2026 This will only increase panic between people and dogs.\u201dPoliticians also joined in. Rahul Gandhi called the directive \u201ca step back from decades of humane, science-backed policy.\u201d Maneka Gandhi described it as \u201cimpractical\u201d and \u201cfinancially unviable,\u201d while Varun Gandhi called it \u201cinstitutionalisation of cruelty.\u201dMeanwhile, MCD vans were spotted picking up dogs, which officials claimed was part of Independence Day preparations, not related to the court order.August 13 \u2013 MCD begins implementationMayor Raja Iqbal Singh announced that 100 stray dogs had already been picked up since the order. The MCD converted 20 Animal Birth Control (ABC) centres into shelters and identified an 85-acre site in outer Delhi for future shelters.Singh said, \u201cWe had assured people that we will implement the order 100 per cent. We are getting a lot of calls from residents.\u201d He clarified that aggressive, rabies-infected, or sick dogs would be picked up first.Twenty-five teams were deployed across the city, and a helpline was promised for residents to report stray dogs. Singh added: \u201cThis is a people\u2019s government, and this is a priority for us.\u201dYet activists continued to criticise the move, warning that inadequate shelters would only worsen the problem and harm the animals.August 14 \u2013 New bench hears caseA new three-judge bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria took over the matter. The bench reserved its verdict on petitions challenging the earlier order.\u201cThe whole problem is because of inaction of the local authorities,\u201d the bench said, accusing NGOs, the Animal Welfare Board and civic bodies of doing \u201cnothing.\u201d Solicitor General Tushar Mehta warned against ignoring the suffering of \u201ca silent majority,\u201d citing 37.15 lakh dog bites in 2024.Senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Singhvi sought a stay on the order, arguing there were no shelters to house such numbers. \u201cThe community feeds them. Now you say because the community is feeding them, take them out and put them in pounds or shelters. There are no shelters in place,\u201d Sibal said.August 16 \u2013 Police scuffle with protestersTensions escalated when a protest near Lodhi Garden turned violent. A Station House Officer was assaulted, with video showing protesters running toward him as voices shouted \u201cmaaro maaro.\u201d Police registered a case under Section 223 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).Another case was filed over a protest near Connaught Place\u2019s Hanuman Temple. Officials said demonstrators had gathered without permission, defying prohibitory orders in force ahead of Independence Day.Police confirmed legal action would be taken against those found violating the law, underscoring the increasingly confrontational nature of the standoff.August 17 \u2013 Chennai joins the protestProtests spread to Chennai, where animal lovers staged demonstrations against the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. The rallies came soon after Delhi protests, with participants decrying the \u201cinhuman\u201d nature of the order.Police registered four FIRs against Delhi protesters from August 11\u201312 who had gathered without permission. Viral videos showed heated exchanges between demonstrators and officers, including one of a Station House Officer being manhandled.The Chennai demonstration marked the first sign that resistance to the ruling was spreading nationally, reinforcing activists\u2019 claims that the order was \u201cregressive\u201d and out of step with India\u2019s long-standing policy of sterilisation and release.August 18 \u2013 Siliguri joins inIn Siliguri, demonstrators denounced the ruling as \u201cinhuman.\u201d Activist Anisha Paul said, \u201cDogs are voiceless creatures\u2026 You can spare criminals, so why can\u2019t you spare dogs? Shame on you.\u201dProtesters carried placards demanding compassion for strays, echoing anger from previous days. Meanwhile, police confirmed that earlier Delhi protests had resulted in FIRs for unlawful assembly under Section 163 of BNSS.The demonstration in Siliguri underscored how smaller cities were also becoming centres of organised resistance, fuelled by social media mobilisation and solidarity with Delhi activists.August 19 \u2013 Capital erupts againMultiple protests were staged across Delhi, including Malviya Nagar, Dwarka, and Greater Noida. Placards read: \u201cRapists on bail and dogs in jail,\u201d and \u201cNo dog, no vote.\u201dActivist Shikha Singh claimed at least 10,000 shelters would be needed for Delhi\u2019s estimated five lakh dogs, but \u201csuch facilities are practically non-existent.\u201d Protesters accused authorities of conducting night raids to pick up dogs, forcing some to patrol neighbourhoods to protect them.Another activist, Mouni Jha, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want shelters for them. They are free to roam like all of us. Shelters mean permanent jail and death for them.\u201dAugust 20 \u2013 Gangtok rally against \u2018cruel blow\u2019In Gangtok, hundreds joined a rally from Zero Point to MG Marg. Organiser Jigmee Ladakhi called the order \u201ca cruel blow to the very essence of coexistence.\u201d\u201cIf we remain silent today, tomorrow compassion will lose its place in society,\u201d he said, urging justice and protection for community dogs.Slogans of \u201cVoice for the Voiceless\u201d and \u201cWe Want Justice\u201d rang out as demonstrators insisted stray dogs were not a burden but protectors of neighbourhoods.August 21 \u2013 \u2018Black Thursday\u2019 at Jantar MantarAnimal rights activists in Delhi observed a \u201cBlack Thursday\u201d at Jantar Mantar, dressed in black and carrying placards like \u201cVaccinate, sterilise, return not remove\u201d and \u201cKindness is our strength.\u201dMukesh Kumar, a 90 per cent disabled activist, said he left home after two years to attend: \u201cInstead of ensuring sterilisation, the government is relocating them.\u201dProtesters pledged to carry out sterilisation drives themselves to create a rabies-free India. Organisers announced that the protest would continue for four days, climaxing in a larger gathering on Saturday.August 22 \u2013 Supreme Court modifies orderThe Supreme Court modified its order, directing that stray dogs be released back into their original areas after sterilisation and vaccination, except rabid or aggressive ones. The MCD must create designated feeding areas, while adoption applications can now be filed by animal lovers.Lawyer-petitioner Nanita Sharma hailed it as a \u201cbalanced order,\u201d saying all pending matters across states will now be transferred to the apex court. \u201cThey have said that regular dogs should be sterilised and aggressive dogs should be put in pounds,\u201d she explained.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The two-week \u2018port facility security course\u2019, designed by CISF in consultation with the directorate general of shipping and other stakeholders, will equip private security personnel with essential knowledge of port operations, threat identification and emergency response. It will also focus on standardisation of port security protocols, compliance with international maritime codes across all the ports, legal frameworks and optimal use of technical gadgets.Renuka Chowdhury, Priyanka Chaturvedi Explode Over CISF Role Against Women MPs in Rajya SabhaDuring the pilot phase, 40 private security personnel from three major ports \u2014 JNPA Sheva, DPA Kandla and MPA Mumbai \u2013 will be trained at JNPA training facility, Mumbai and 26 private security personnel from four major ports\u2014New Mangalore Port Authority (NMPA), Kamarajar Port Limited (KPL) Ennore, Chennai Port Authority (ChPA), and V O Chidambaranar Port Authority (VOCPA) Tuticorin\u2014 at the ChPA training centre, Chennai.

A CISF spokesperson on Thursday said the \u2018port facility security course\u2019 represents a strategic step to build resilience against evolving threats, while bolstering India\u2019s role in safeguarding maritime trade in the Indian Ocean region.To be delivered by instructors from CISF, customs, marine department, and port health organisation, the program combines classroom learning with hands-on drills, preparing participants to respond effectively to security incidents.During the inaugural session at ChPA, CISF Inspector-General S R Saravanan said that \u201cfocused training tailored to the complex environment of ports, will empower security personnel to perform their duties with confidence and professionalism, ultimately safeguarding critical infrastructure and trade.\u201dAbout the AuthorBharti JainBharti Jain is senior editor with The Times of India, New Delhi.

NEW DELHI: Astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla on Friday shared a breathtaking timelapse video of India from space, offering citizens a glimpse of his journey aboard the International Space Station (ISS).Posting the clip on X, Shukla wrote: \u201cWatch the video in landscape with screen brightness high. While on orbit I tried to capture pictures and videos so that I can share this journey with you all. This is a timelapse video of Bharat from space. The ISS is moving from south to north from the Indian Ocean, along the east coast of India.\u201dHe explained that the purple flashes seen in the video were thunderstorms across the country, followed by the Himalayas fading into view, and then a sunrise over the orbit \u2014 all against the backdrop of shimmering stars. \u201cIt truly is a mesmerising dance of natural elements turning into one beautiful spectacle,\u201d Shukla wrote, adding that despite heavy monsoon clouds he managed to \u201csteal a few shots of Bharat.\u201d\"Unfortunately I was up there during the monsoon season and it was mostly cloudy, yet I managed to steal a few shots of Bharat, one of which you are seeing.

He promises to expose them, claiming they were jealous of his popularity and colluded with BJP and RSS to tarnish his image. This follows his expulsion from RJD and the launch of his own political outfit.  NEW DELHI: Expelled RJD leader and former Bihar minister Tej Pratap Yadav on Thursday alleged that five powerful families conspired against him to destroy both his political and personal life. The elder son of RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav claimed he would soon reveal their identities.'Threat To Life, But Not Scared': Tej Pratap's Explosive Revelation, Throws Challenge to RJD Leaders\u201cFive families together and in a broader conspiracy tried to end my political life. In my more than ten years of political life, I have never wronged anyone, nor have I ever conspired against anyone. But these five families have made every effort to destroy my political and family life completely,\u201d Tej Pratap wrote on X.He further said, \u201cTomorrow (Friday), I will bring the faces and characters of all five families before the public. I am going to expose each of their conspiracies tomorrow.\u201dOn Wednesday, Tej Pratap had also posted, \u201cFive people worked together to completely ruin my life... They could not tolerate my jovial nature and hence made such allegations to ruin my career. I will go to court and file a case too... I think these people took money from RSS and BJP and tried to tarnish my image because they saw that elections are coming and there is a craze among the youth for me. I will soon put the names of these people from five families in front of everyone... These conspirators have a gang from Patna to Delhi... They used to be in RJD but were expelled due to their misdeeds... These individuals have no other job except to be constantly active on social media, using it to tarnish the image of others...\u201dTej Pratap\u2019s remarks come months after his father Lalu Prasad expelled him from the Rashtriya Janata Dal and \u201cfamily\u201d for six years in May, after a controversial Facebook post claimed he had been in a 12-year-long relationship with a woman named Anushka Yadav. Tej Pratap later alleged that his Facebook account had been hacked and that the post was part of a conspiracy against him.Following his expulsion, Tej Pratap launched a separate political outfit under the banner of \u2018Team Tej Pratap Yadav\u2019 and aligned with five smaller parties to contest the upcoming 2025 Bihar assembly elections. He has been campaigning aggressively across the state, often calling his rivals \u201cJaychand\u201d (traitors).Lalu Prasad earlier in May had justified the expulsion by saying, \u201cIgnoring moral values in personal life weakens our collective struggle for social justice. The actions, public conduct, and irresponsible behavior of my eldest son are not in accordance with our family\u2019s principles. Therefore, under these circumstances, I am removing him from the party and the family.\u201dTej Pratap\u2019s younger brother and leader of opposition in Bihar, Tejashwi Yadav, had said at the time that while the party would not tolerate such controversies, his brother was \u201can adult and free to make decisions.\u201dAbout the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

As they shouted \u201cno,\u201d he said, \u201cStalin uncle, hear the noise of the people.\u201dBJP, AIADMK Stitch Alliance to Contest 2026 Tamil Nadu Assembly Polls TogetherOn DMK\u2019s approach to BJP, Vijay accused the ruling party of shifting positions. \u201cWhen in opposition, they flew black balloons against Modi. Now, as the ruling party, they welcome him. Whenever ED raids take place, they rush to Delhi and the raids fade away. Stalin uncle, what uncle? It is very wrong uncle,\u201d he said, and the gathered cadres burst into laughter.The TVK chief also posed pointed questions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking whether he had come to power for the third time \u201cto do good for the people or to plot something against the Muslim community\u201d. He pressed Centre to retrieve Katchatheevu island, withdraw NEET and resolve the plight of \u201caround 800 fishermen\u201d arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy. He accused BJP of hiding facts about the Keeladi excavations and depending on \u201calliance partners without real people power\u201d to extend its rule till 2029.Without naming AIADMK, Vijay said BJP was using the party once nurtured by M G Ramachandran as a \u201cbackdoor to enter Tamil Nadu\u201d. He said that even that party\u2019s cadres were upset with their present state.TVK, he said, would be a \u201ctruly secular party\u201d that would never have any hidden tie-up with BJP. He added that alliances under TVK would give equal power to partners.Indirectly addressing critics, Vijay said, \u201cA lion comes to the ground only to hunt, not to pass time. Even if it is single, it will be the king of the jungle. It is not just a description but a clear declaration.\u201d He greeted his cadres as \u201clion cubs\u201d and described TVK as an \u201carmy of common people.\u201dVijay said TVK had already created \u201cripples\u201d in state politics. \u201cMany said I will not enter politics, then that I will not get support, then that I cannot conduct a conference. Now they say I cannot win elections. They also say this crowd may not translate into votes. To those analysts, I say \u2014 this crowd is not just support, we have already entered every household in the state.\u201dHe emphasised that the safety of women, children and the elderly would be TVK\u2019s top priority, and pledged welfare measures for youth, farmers, labourers, weavers, fisherfolk, the disabled, elderly and transpersons.Amid cheers, Vijay made a surprise announcement, saying he would contest from Madurai East constituency in 2026. After a short pause, Vijay named all the nine remaining constituencies and asked people to assume that he himself is contesting in all 234 assembly constituencies in the state.In a symbolic gesture, he sang an MGR song from the movie \u2018Enga Veetu Pillai\u2019, asking whether people could \u201ctake the whip of politics\u201d and use it against both BJP and DMK.Vijay concluded with a parting shot at stereotypes about actors in politics. \u201cLeaders such as Ambedkar, Kamaraj and Nallakannu were defeated by politicians, not by cinema actors. Not all politicians are knowledgeable, and not every actor is an idiot,\u201d he declared, drawing loud applause.",

        "input": "The United Nations confirms famine in Gaza City. This marks the first official famine in the Middle East. The crisis may spread without a ceasefire and aid. UN aid chief Tom Fletcher says obstruction by Israel is the reason. Israel rejects the report, calling it false. The IPC uses strict criteria for famine classification. After almost 3 years of war, UN declares a famine in Gaza City  The United Nations on Friday confirmed that famine has struck Gaza City, marking the first officially declared famine in the Middle East. The declaration came from the integrated food security phase classification (IPC), the world\u2019s leading authority on food crises.The IPC report said famine was now occurring in the Gaza Governorate, which includes Gaza City and accounts for around 20 per cent of the territory. Experts cautioned that the crisis could extend to southern areas like Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah without an immediate ceasefire and full access for humanitarian aid.\u2018A famine that haunts us all\u2019: UN aid chief UN aid chief Tom Fletcher delivered a message during a briefing in Geneva, saying the famine was entirely preventable. \u201cIt is a famine that we could have prevented if we had been allowed. Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel,\u201d Fletcher said. He called the situation \u201ca famine that will and must haunt us all\u201d.UN rights chief Volker Turk said \"it is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare\", moments after famine was declared.According to the IPC, from early July to mid-August, Gaza witnessed the sharpest deterioration in food security since monitoring began. One-third of Gaza\u2019s population is projected to face catastrophic levels of hunger by the end of next month, the report stated.\u2018Hamas lies\u2019: Israeli governmentIsraeli foreign ministry dismissed the UN-backed report as \u201cfalse and biased\u201d. In a statement, it said: \u201cThere is no famine in Gaza,\u201d and claimed the findings were based on \u201cHamas lies laundered through organisations with vested interests\u201d.Similarly, COGAT, the Israeli military agency responsible for aid transfers, called the report \u201cfalse and biased\u201d and said significant steps have been taken recently to increase aid delivery to Gaza.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also rejected reports of starvation.Why is Gaza now officially in famine?Famine classification requires strict conditions to be met, and the IPC uses a globally recognised system. It labels an area as being in famine when three criteria are confirmed:At least 20 per cent of households face extreme food shortages.At least 30 per cent of children aged six months to five years suffer from acute malnutrition by weight-to-height measurement, or 15 per cent based on arm circumference.Two adults or four children under five per 10,000 people die daily from starvation or related disease.The IPC said data collected between July 1 and August 15 showed these thresholds had been reached in Gaza City. Mortality data is harder to confirm due to access restrictions.First famine in the Middle EastThis is the first time the IPC has confirmed famine in the Middle East. The organisation has previously declared famine in Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and parts of Sudan\u2019s Darfur region in 2023.The IPC includes over a dozen UN agencies, governments, and humanitarian organisations. An independent Famine Review Committee (FRC) also verified the Gaza findings, adding another layer of scrutiny.Why are deaths hard to trackExperts note that deaths during famine often occur from a combination of malnutrition and infection rather than hunger alone. \u201cThere are no standard guidelines for physicians to classify cause of death as \u2018malnutrition\u2019 as opposed to infection,\u201d said Alex de Waal, author of Mass Starvation and executive director of the World Peace Foundation.He explained that diarrhoea and dehydration linked to infections commonly affect children with severe malnutrition. Most excess deaths in such crises result from disease, deprivation, and malnutrition together, rather than starvation alone.The IPC warned that without a ceasefire and unrestricted aid deliveries, famine conditions will spread beyond Gaza City within weeks. \u201cThe situation is worsening at an unprecedented pace,\u201d the report said.Since the conflict began on October 7, 2023, following Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel, more than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza\u2019s health ministry.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

At least 12 workers have died and four others are missing after an under construction bridge collapsed into the Yellow River in northwest China on Friday, state media said.Footage aired by state broadcaster CCTV captured the moment the arch section of the bridge gave way and crashed into the waters below. According to state news agency Xinhua, the disaster was triggered by a steel cable failure.The People\u2019s Daily reported that 16 people: 15 workers and a project manager had been on site when the structure gave way. CCTV confirmed that ten people were killed, while two others were seriously injured at first and died later. Four people have yet to be found, AFP reported.The bridge, part of the Sichuan\u2013Qinghai Railway, has been hailed as the world\u2019s largest-span double-track continuous steel truss arch bridge. It is also the first railway steel truss arch bridge in China to cross the Yellow River, the country\u2019s second-longest river.Pictures shared by state media showed the broken frame of the unfinished bridge, its middle section missing, with cranes and tall scaffolding towers standing around the site.Hundreds of emergency responders were dispatched to join search and rescue efforts, Xinhua said.Accidents of this kind are not uncommon in China, where enforcement of safety rules is often weak.

        "input": "A critically ill seven-year-old Saudi boy received a lifesaving heart transplant at KFSHRC in Riyadh, with the donor heart airlifted from Abu Dhabi. The complex, time-sensitive operation involved seamless cross-border coordination between Saudi and UAE medical authorities. The procedure highlights KFSHRC\u2019s global leadership in cardiac care and the success of Gulf-wide healthcare collaboration. King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Riyadh is a leading cardiac center known for pioneering advanced robotic heart surgeries/ Representative image In a rare and urgent cross-border medical effort, doctors in Riyadh successfully transplanted a donor heart into a seven-year-old Saudi boy suffering from end-stage heart failure. The heart, retrieved from a brain-dead donor in Abu Dhabi, was transported to Saudi Arabia and implanted in a high-risk surgery coordinated between Saudi and UAE health authorities. This lifesaving procedure underscores both the precision of transplant logistics and the increasing strength of regional healthcare partnerships andcooperation.Complex condition and urgent meed Faisal, a seven-year-old Saudi child, was battling advanced heart failure caused by a congenital defect present since birth. Despite exhaustive treatment attempts, including various medications, respiratory support, and even pacemaker implantation, his condition showed no significant improvement. The severity of his illness necessitated immediate placement on the urgent heart transplant list. With no other viable options left, the transplant became a race against time.The transplant\u2019s success hinged on a narrow five-hour window, the maximum time allowed from organ extraction to transplantation to maintain viability. This time sensitivity posed a significant challenge, especially as the donor was located abroad in Abu Dhabi. Coordinating the extraction, air transport, and preparation of surgical teams required meticulous planning and swift action.According to Dr. Felix Wang Tsai, pediatric cardiology surgery consultant at KFSHRC, Faisal arrived in very critical condition, making the transplant his only chance at survival. KFSHRC typically performs only 10 to 15 heart transplants annually, emphasizing the critical need to increase donor availability within Saudi Arabia to support more patients like Faisal.Seamless cross-border cooperationThe transplant was made possible through the collaboration of the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation and the UAE\u2019s National Program for Donation and Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissue (Hayat). The process involved consent from the donor\u2019s family and all necessary regulatory approvals, underscoring a strong humanitarian partnership between the two countries.Ahmad Jaafari, director of donor affairs and organ allocation at the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation, described how donor data was quickly analyzed and shared with KFSHRC, where Faisal was listed as a high priority patient. With approvals from the Ministry of Health\u2019s medical ethics center, a specialized medical team and private aircraft were dispatched to Abu Dhabi for organ retrieval and rapid transfer. Dr. Hani Al-Sergani, executive director of the Heart Centre of Excellence at KFSHRC, told Arab News that this case exemplifies the maturity of Gulf healthcare collaboration. He emphasized that the successful transplant within hours showcased regional cooperation\u2019s vital role in expanding life-saving opportunities.In a statement, the hospital said, \u201cThis marks another successful case of advanced regional cooperation in organ transplantation,\u201dThe hospital further confirmed that the life-saving procedure was carried out only after securing donor family consent, all necessary regulatory approvals, and close coordination between the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation and the UAE\u2019s National Program for Donation and Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissue.King Faisal Specialist Hospital\u2019s role and achievementsKFSHRC\u2019s Heart Centre, recognized globally for its advanced cardiac care, played a pivotal role in Faisal\u2019s successful transplant. The hospital has pioneered several groundbreaking cardiac surgeries, including the world\u2019s first fully robotic heart transplant and robotic implantation of artificial heart pumps (BiVAD-HMIII) without chest incisions. These innovations have placed KFSHRC at the forefront of cardiac surgery, cementing its status as the leading cardiac center in the Middle East and North Africa and ranking 15th globally among the world\u2019s top academic medical centers.In 2024, the hospital delivered 293,381 virtual consultations, marking a 58.2% increase year-on-year, reflecting its expanding healthcare reach and integration of advanced technologies. The successful transplant of Faisal\u2019s heart is another milestone in KFSHRC\u2019s mission to provide specialized, cutting-edge care.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

He warned that \u201charsh measures\u201d would follow if she was not released. \u201cFREE TINA PETERS, a brave and innocent Patriot who has been tortured by Crooked Colorado politicians, including the big Mail-In Ballot supporting governor of the State,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. \u201cLet Tina Peters out of jail, RIGHT NOW.\u201d Peters, 69, was found guilty by a Colorado jury in 2024 on seven charges, including four felonies, for tampering with Mesa County\u2019s voting machines. She was sentenced in October to nine years in prison for attempting to influence a public servant, conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation and official misconduct. The former Mesa County clerk became a prominent figure among election deniers after she facilitated access to voting systems in search of voter fraud, claims that she and her allies failed to substantiate. She was the first election official charged in connection with a security breach linked to conspiracy theories surrounding the 2020 presidential election. Trump has repeatedly backed Peters, asking the Justice Department in May to intervene on her behalf. This is his second public appeal in recent months for her release. However, Peters was convicted in a Colorado state court, beyond the scope of presidential clemency powers. The president has used her case to intensify attacks on mail-in ballots and to push for sweeping election changes. In March, he signed an executive order requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration and has indicated plans for another order curbing mail-in voting.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Fateh, a 35-year-old Somali American and democratic socialist, had stunned party insiders in July by winning more than 60% of delegate support, defeating incumbent Mayor Jacob Frey for the DFL\u2019s backing. But on Thursday, state party chair Richard Carlbom said a review by the DFL\u2019s Constitution, Bylaws & Rules Committee uncovered \u201csubstantial failures\u201d in the convention\u2019s voting process. \u201cA mayoral candidate was errantly eliminated from contention,\u201d Carlbom said, calling for \u201cunity and a focus on electing DFL leaders.\u201d The probe found nearly 200 missing votes, a lost ward credentials book and security lapses in the electronic voting system, which Frey\u2019s campaign had earlier challenged as \u201chighly flawed and untested.\u201d As a result, the Minneapolis DFL was stripped of its authority to endorse a mayoral candidate this year and placed on two-year probation. All candidates will now have equal access to party voter rolls, which are typically reserved for endorsed nominees. Frey welcomed the move, saying, \u201cI am proud to be a member of a party that believes in correcting our mistakes \u2026 the outcome now rests squarely where it should \u2014 with all the people of Minneapolis.\u201d Fateh, however, condemned the decision as a power grab by party insiders. \u201cTwenty-eight party insiders voted to take away our endorsement behind closed doors,\u201d he said in a video statement, accusing Frey\u2019s supporters and donors of influencing the process. \u201cThis is exactly what Minneapolis voters are sick of \u2026 Let me be clear. We\u2019re still in this fight, and we\u2019re going to win.\u201d Frey, first elected in 2017 and re-elected in 2021, faced criticism over his handling of the city\u2019s unrest following George Floyd\u2019s killing in 2020.

Traditional dishes such as lamb ouzi, loqaimat (sweet dumplings), and a signature drink made from camel milk, rehash, and toasted pistachio have offered Japanese and international guests a taste of Emirati hospitality and culinary tradition.In addition, summer culinary workshops for children and families have proven especially popular, with young Japanese participants learning the art of pastry-making under the guidance of Emirati chefs.

(Picture credit: AP) California has set up a high-stakes ballot fight after lawmakers approved a redrawn congressional map aimed at boosting Democrats in next year\u2019s elections, directly countering a Republican plan in Texas backed by US President Donald Trump.The Democratic-controlled Legislature passed the bills on Thursday, and Governor Gavin Newsom swiftly signed them, also calling a special election for 4 November for voters to approve the changes. \u201cThis is not something six weeks ago that I ever imagined that I\u2019d be doing,\u201d Newsom said at a press conference, calling the move a reaction to \u201can assault on our democracy in Texas,\u201d as reported by news agency AP.The plan is designed to help Democrats pick up five additional House seats, while Republicans in Texas are advancing a map with the same goal for themselves. According to the New York Times, Trump has urged Republican-led states, including Indiana, Missouri and Ohio to pursue similar mid-decade redraws in an attempt to secure a stronger GOP majority in the 2026 midterms.Republicans in California have fiercely opposed the governor\u2019s approach.

        "input": "Military leaders from the US and European allies are developing security guarantees for Ukraine, following Trump's pledge to help protect the nation as part of a settlement with Moscow. Discussions involve potential strategies, with Europe taking the lead in deployment and the US playing a supporting role. While Trump ruled out ground troops, he signaled openness to other military support.  Military leaders from the United States and key European allies have drawn up options for providing security guarantees to Ukraine, officials confirmed on Thursday, marking a significant step in ongoing efforts to end Russia\u2019s nearly four-year war.According to a report from Reuters, the proposals were presented to national security advisers from both sides of the Atlantic after US President Donald Trump pledged to help protect Ukraine as part of any settlement with Moscow. A Pentagon statement said US and European planners had developed military options for \u201cappropriate consideration,\u201d following a Reuters report that first revealed the deliberations.Allies gather in WashingtonThe chiefs of defence from the US, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the UK, and Ukraine met in Washington between Tuesday and Thursday to hash out potential strategies. According to Reuters, sources said discussions focused on how Europe could take the lead in any deployment, with the US likely playing a supporting role.US secretary of state and national security Adviser Marco Rubio later held a conference call with his European counterparts, including UK national security adviser Jonathan Powell, the European Commission president\u2019s chief of cabinet Bjoern Seibert, Nato secretary general\u2019s chief of staff Geoffrey van Leeuwen, and senior officials from France, Germany, Italy, and Finland.Europe to carry \"Lion\u2019s Share\"While plans remain fluid, officials suggested European countries would bear the bulk of responsibility for forces deployed in Ukraine \u2014 a position echoed by US Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday. \u201cThe planning work continues,\u201d one source said, adding that Washington is still \u201cdetermining the scope of its role.\u201dTrump has ruled out deploying US ground troops but signalled openness to other forms of military support, such as command-and-control oversight or US airpower. Options under consideration reportedly include supplying additional air defence systems, deploying fighter jets to enforce a no-fly zone, and placing US officers in charge of European contingents, according to Reuters.European leaders back deploymentFrench President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer have both endorsed the idea of a European-led peacekeeping force, while German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has expressed cautious support. However, Germany\u2019s powerful soldiers\u2019 union warned Thursday that Nato leaders must face the reality that tens of thousands of troops would be required for any long-term mission in Ukraine.Trump pushes for quick endThe US president has repeatedly pressed for a rapid end to what he has called \u201cEurope\u2019s war,\u201d raising concerns in Kyiv and among allies that Washington might push for a settlement on Russia\u2019s terms. Still, the flurry of military planning underscores the seriousness with which Western leaders are preparing for potential security guarantees, should a ceasefire or broader peace deal be reached.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Authorities are investigating the incident as an accident, with OSHA also launching a probe. Three others were hospitalized but later released. AI image Six men lost their lives in a possible consequence of gas exposure at a large dairy farm in Weld County, Colorado, authorities confirmed on Thursday. The victims, all Hispanic males, were found inside a confined space at Prospect Valley Dairy near Keenesburg, around 35 miles northeast of Denver.According to news agency AP, chief deputy coroner for Weld County Jolene Weiner said investigators are treating the deaths as likely caused by toxic gas exposure. \u201cWe are investigating these deaths as the possible consequence of gas exposure in a confined space,\u201d she said, adding that autopsies are planned to determine the exact cause.Fire crews were called to the farm on Wednesday evening for what was initially reported as a \u201cconfined space rescue.\u201d Instead, they recovered the bodies, said Tom Beach, chief of the Southeast Weld Fire Protection District, as reported by the New York Times.Three other individuals were taken to the hospital but have since been released, as per NBC News. Officials emphasised that there was no sign of criminal activity. \u201cIt looks like an accident,\u201d Weld County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokeswoman Melissa Chesmore said, while declining to elaborate on the precise circumstances.The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has launched an investigation, according to the department of labour. Farming groups expressed shock. Dairy Farmers of America, which confirmed the site was one of its member farms, called it a \u201ctragic accident,\u201d offering condolences to the families of the deceased.The property, records show, is owned by Prospect Valley Dairy LLC, with a California-based address listed for its owners. The dairy includes a milking parlour of about 3,000 square metres and two free-stall barns, one nearly 42,000 square metres and another over 9,000.Keenesburg, the small town nearest to the farm, has about 2,000 residents, many of whom work in agriculture or the oil and gas sector. \u201cWe\u2019re a very close-knit community. It\u2019s mostly just farm fields,\u201d mayor Aron Lam was quoted as saying by the New York Times.Farming is considered among the most dangerous occupations in the United States. As per by the New York Times, dairy workers in particular face risks from machinery, livestock, and toxic gases that accumulate in manure pits. Colorado has seen similar tragedies before: in 2021, an immigrant farmworker drowned after his truck overturned into a manure lagoon at another dairy farm in La Salle.Weiner confirmed that the names of the six victims are being withheld until families are notified.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Rodriguez Singh had been wanted for the 2022 murder of her son and was placed on the FBI\u2019s most wanted list. On October 3, 2024, Interpol issued a Red Notice against her, which was circulated to all member countries, including India.Singh has been transported to the United States and will be turned over to Texas authorities. Rodriguez Singh was added to the \"most wanted\" list in July this year. FBI had also raised the reward for information leading to her arrest from $25,000 to $250,000. Fox News Digital reported that Rodriguez Singh was facing an active federal warrant for \u201cunlawful flight to avoid prosecution\u201d and a Texas state warrant for \u201ccapital murder of a person under 10 years of age.\u201d Authorities said Noel was one of ten children born to Rodriguez Singh. While three siblings lived with their grandparents, the others stayed with her and her husband, Arshdeep Singh, in Everman, a suburb of Fort Worth under squalid conditions. Investigators said Arshdeep Singh, Noel\u2019s stepfather, was of Indian origin. They believed Rodriguez Singh fled the US with him and six of her children to India. Just days after Noel was officially reported missing, the couple and their children boarded a one-way flight to India on March 22, 2023.

A Canadian court has blocked the deportation of Jagjit Singh, an Indian-origin man, citing that his separation from his wife, who has ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder), will cause \"irreparable harm\" to the wife. According to the court filing, Singh came to Canada in 2021 on a temporary resident visa and made a refugee claim. Then he got married in Canada and his wife applied to sponsor his permanent resident application, and Jagjit Singh withdrew his refugee claim this year.But his removal process already began while his resident application was under review and the Canada Border Services Agency finally ordered him to be deported. Singh appealed to Canada's federal court against the deportation order and claimed that he would be in danger if he were sent back to India.Singh also claimed that his removal would cause \"serious prejudices to his spouse due to her health conditions\".Federal Judge Avvy Yao-Yao Go said she has evidence in front of her that Singh's wife, referred to as LB in court documents, suffers from ADHD which impairs her ability to manage time and everyday responsibilities. \"In the case before me, there is evidence that L.B. suffers from ADHD which impairs her ability to manage time, stress focus and everyday responsibilities and that [Singh] provides her with support by, among other things, helping her maintain daily structure and reminders for medications and appointments, and providing her with emotional stability and mental health support,\" Go said.The ruling drew backlash on social media, with many users pointing out that ADHD is not that serious. \"The judge who halted an Indian man's deportation order because his wife has ADHD was an activist before being appointed to the bench,\" one wrote. Many social media users said his wife should also go to India with him. \"I wonder how his wife survived before she met him?\" one person said. \"This is beyond insulting. Not only to people with ADHD, but to our country. So pathetic,\" another wrote.The judge faced backlash for citing his wife\u2019s ADHD as an excuse, with many saying it undermined those who actually suffer from the condition Avvy Yao-Yao Go immigrated to Canada from Hong Kong in the 1980s and worked as Clinic Director of the Chinese and Southeast Asian Legal Clinic before becoming a judge.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

One of the group took his metal water bottle and hit him above the eye, causing heavy bleeding. He was taken to hospital where he received eight stitches. Garda\u00ed confirmed they are investigating the assault and his injuries are \u201cnon-life threatening\u201d.An Indian-origin woman has put a post on Reddit saying her 60-year-old father was harassed by boys, aged around seven and eight, who tried to take his wallet at a bus stop in Dublin on Aug 9.These are just the latest in a string of racist attacks targeting Indians in Ireland which have left the Indian community terrified to step outside.India Day in Ireland, which celebrates the country\u2019s cultural ties, has been postponed this Sunday owing to the wave of hate crimes. The event has been organised by the Ireland India Council since 2015. A Ficci India Day event is going ahead in Dublin on Aug 17.Indian community leaders met Ireland deputy PM Simon Harris on Monday after which he condemned the \u201cdespicable acts of violence and racism\u201d.Chairman of the Ireland India Council Prashant Shukla told Ireland AM: \u201cWe weren\u2019t worried about the event itself as the Garda\u00ed assured us about safety, but we were worried about the perception it could lead to further attacks. Our message to the Irish community is that these attacks are attacks on your economy and industry. Policing needs to go to the next level. I feel there are not proper investigations and arrests. We are all working, paying taxes and contributing to the economy. No one is getting a free house. People are spreading misinformation that Indians buying houses is causing house prices to go up.\u201dPresident of Ireland Michael D Higgins on Tuesday also condemned the attacks. \u201cA lot of Indians are reconsidering their choices and may move back to India if the situation doesn\u2019t improve. It is mostly being caused by far-right groups encouraging teenagers to attack immigrants. Indians are the most visible immigrants here,\u201d said Indian national Some Aditya Mandal, who has worked in Dublin for eight years.",

This unusual move suggests the influence of RFK Jr within the Trump administration despite pressure from right-wing activists. RFK Jr opposed anti-vaxxer Dr Prasad's exit and remained invested to bring him back.  Dr Vinay Prasad is back at his FDA job weeks after exit that was prompted by right-wing activist Laura Loomer's campaigning against Prasad. Dr Vinay Prasad, the Indian-origin vaccine chief of the FDA who was forced to resign in July after far-right activist Laura Loomer led a campaign against him, has been reinstated to his job in an unusual instance. Laura Loomer pointed out the critical comments that Dr Prasad made about President Donald Trump before joining the administration, while some of his decisions to deny drug approvals also came under fire. A Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson confirmed to the New York Times that Dr Prasad is returning to the agency. \u201cAt the F.D.A.\u2019s request, Dr. Vinay Prasad is resuming leadership of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research,\u201d Andrew Nixon, a health department spokesman, said in a statement.The NYT report observed that Dr Prasad's rehiring suggests that the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr., and the FDA commissioner, Dr Marty Makary, remain influential enough in the Trump administration to employ someone who had previously expressed disdain for Trump and his followers.Loomer reacted to the reinstatement and called in another \"egregious personnel decision\". \"In another egregious personnel decision under the Trump administration, it is now being reported that longtime progressive Marxist Vinay Prasad who referred to President Trump\u2019s supporters as criminals and compared them to drug addicts after saying he stabbed a Trump voodoo doll to \u201ccurse Trump\u201d is apparently back at FDA,\" Loomer wrote.RFK Jr tapped Dr Prasad in May when the previous head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation left the role. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Dr Prasad gained prominence as an outspoken critic of vaccines and mask mandate. In his short stint at the FDA since May, Dr Prasad limited the use of Covid-19 vaccines and promoted warnings about a rare side effect of the vaccines. When he resigned from his role weeks ago, a department spokesperson told the NYT: \"Dr. Prasad did not want to be a distraction to the great work of the FDA in the Trump administration and has decided to return to California and spend more time with his family.\"Kennedy, however, opposed Prasad's departure from the role and remained invested in bringing him back. Dr Prasad was born and brought up in Ohio and Chicago to Indian immigrant parents.

In a separate incident, Laxman Das, an Indian sous chef in Dublin, was attacked and robbed while going to work. These incidents follow a series of recent assaults targeting Indians in Ireland, raising concerns about racism.  TOI correspondent from London: A six-year-old Indian-origin girl and an Indian sous chef are the latest victims in the ongoing spate of racist attacks targeting Indian nationals and Indian-origin Irish people in Ireland.The girl, whose family hail from Kottayam, Kerala, was playing outside her house in Waterford City, southeast Ireland, with friends at 7.30pm on Monday evening when a gang of boys and one girl called her a \u201cdirty Indian\u201d and told her to \u201cgo back to India\u201d. She was born in Ireland. Five of the gang also punched her in the face, hit her private parts with a bicycle, punched her neck and twisted her hair.Her mother moved to Ireland eight years ago from Kottayam to work as a nurse with her husband and recently became an Irish citizen.The mother said the gang was made up of boys aged 12 to 14 and a girl aged eight. She said her daughter came home in floods of tears and is now too scared to play outside. She told the Irish Mirror: \u201cI never expected that such an incident would happen. I thought she would be safe here. Even in front of our own house she can\u2019t play safely. I am a nurse, I am doing my best to take care of people. I do my work and I am 100% professional. I changed my citizenship, but still we are called dirty people and even my kids are not safe. We came here to fill a labour gap. We are professionals \u2014 we have all the certificates\u2026\u201dThe mother studied BSc Nursing at University of Calicut and went to Mount Carmel Higher Secondary School in Kottayam.\u201cGarda\u00ed (Irish national police) responded to a report of an alleged assault in the Kilbarry area of Waterford city on the evening of Monday 4 August. Investigations are ongoing,\u201d a Garda spokesperson told TOI.On Wednesday morning Laxman Das from Kolkata, who works as a sous chef at the Anantara The Marker Dublin hotel, was assaulted near the Hilton Hotel by three people while on his way to work. He was taken to St Vincent's University Hospital. His phone, cash and electric bike were stolen.These come following a spate of attacks against Indians in Ireland in recent weeks \u2014 on July 19, July 24, July 27, and on Aug 1 when a cab driver was assaulted.The Garda\u00ed said they are still investigating these attacks and no one has been arrested.",

Authorities took him into custody in Niagara Falls, New York. He faces a potential 10-year prison sentence. The arrest is part of 'Operation Take Back America'. This initiative targets illegal immigration.  An Indian national has been arrested in the United States for allegedly possessing a forged alien resident card, according to the Justice Department. Swapnil Ramesh Tejale, 34, was taken into custody following a traffic stop in Niagara Falls, New York, and now faces a federal charge that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.\u201cOn July 10, 2025, the Niagara Falls Border Patrol Station received a request from the Niagara Falls Police Department to help identify three individuals that they had encountered during a traffic stop,\u201d said Assistant US Attorney Michael J. Smith, who is prosecuting the case. \u201cAgents arrived at the scene and questioned the three individuals as to their citizenship. Tejale presented a Lawful Permanent Resident Card but voluntarily admitted that the card was fictitious.\u201dAuthorities later confirmed that Tejale was in the country unlawfully and did not possess any valid immigration documents. Following his arrest, agents discovered a Social Security card in his name, which was also found to be counterfeit.The case falls under \u201cOperation Take Back America\u201d, a Justice Department initiative aimed at tackling illegal immigration and dismantling transnational criminal organisations. The operation seeks to \u201crepel the invasion of illegal immigration\u201d and \u201cprotect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime\u201d, the department said.The investigation was led by the US Border Patrol Niagara Falls Station, under the direction of Patrol Agent in Charge Brady Waikal.Tejale\u2019s arrest is part of a series of immigration enforcement actions involving Indian nationals this year. In a related incident, an Indian man from Santa Rosa, California, was sentenced in March to six months in prison for conspiracy to transport aliens for profit. Meanwhile, Manjot Singh, a 25-year-old Indian national, was recently arrested in the Seattle area for repeat offences including robbery, assault, and criminal impersonation. Singh, who entered the U.S. illegally, is currently in ICE custody pending deportation.ICE officials have said that Singh\u2019s arrest is a warning to repeat offenders: \u201cThose who violate US laws while in the country illegally face arrest and deportation.\u201dAbout the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Viral footage shows firefighters inspecting the scene as the family performed the ritual. (Photo: X) A housewarming ceremony involving a Hindu havan at a Texas home took an unexpected turn when local firefighters arrived at the scene, mistaking the ritual for a fire emergency.The incident was captured on video. The footage has gone viral and has fuelled an online debate over cultural awareness and fire safety. The clip was originally shared on Instagram. It shows a fire truck from the Bedford fire department pulling up outside the house as smoke from the ceremony fills the garage. Inside, an Indian family can be seen performing a traditional havan, a religious ritual involving fire, as part of their housewarming puja.The video includes on-screen text stating, \"Cultural misunderstanding 101: A Hindu puja is not a fire emergency. When you're having a housewarming havan and the fire department pulls up.\"Shortly after the fire crew arrives, they are seen speaking with members of the family and inspecting the area. However, it remains unclear whether any formal action was taken or if any fire codes were violated during the ritual.The footage has since been widely circulated across social media platforms, with users offering differing views on the incident. Some social media users criticised the family for conducting a ritual involving fire in a residential setting, arguing it could pose safety risks. Others defended the family\u2019s right to observe their religious customs, calling the incident a clear example of cultural misunderstanding.No official comment was immeditaely released by the Bedford fire department.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Indian-origin Mathura Sridharan was appointed as Ohio's 12th solicitor general, inviting the wrath of online trolls who questioned why a 'non-US-origin' person was not picked for the post. Sridharan's LinkedIn went viral as critics questioned her credibility -- forcing Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost to issue a clarification, or a clapback at the trolls. Dave Yost, who announced Mathura's promotion, said Mathura is wrongly being portrayed as a non-American. \"A few commenters have asserted incorrectly that Mathura is not American. She is a United States citizen, married to a US citizen, and the child of naturalized US citizens,\" he said. \"If her name or her complexion bother you, the problem is not with her or her appointment,\" he added.\"Mathura is brilliant\u2026 she won her argument at SCOTUS last year. Both the SGs she worked under (Flowers & Gaiser) recommended her. I told her when I originally hired her I needed her to argue with me. She does\u2026 All the time! Excited to promote her. She will serve Ohio well,\" Yost wrote.Yost's clapback also met trolling as people commented that she is not \"American-American\". \"Is she a Christian? That\u2019s the biggest factor that concerns me. Based on the bindi on her forehead, I worry she is not,\" one wrote. \"Another American job\u2026 given away to foreigners,\" another wrote. \"She's Indian. They all have a loyalty first to other Indians. horrible pick. Totally un-American. the GOP is pathetic,\" a third user wrote.\"No one with the last name 'Sridharan' fought in the US Civil War. She's not an American,\" another wrote.Before joining the Ohio Solicitor\u2019s Office, Mathura clerked for Judge Steven J. Menashi of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and Judge Deborah A. Batts of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. She holds a Juris Doctor from New York University School of Law, a Master\u2019s Degree in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Economics and in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

After Indian-origin Nikhil Ravishankar was appointed as the new chief executive of Air New Zealand, the country's media said they had to disable comments on social media as there was a barrage of racist remarks targeting Ravishankar's ethnicity. Ravishankar was the chief digital officer of Air New Zealand before getting the major promotion which is the first for an Indian-origin person in the country.New Zealand Herald, Radio New Zealand, 1News said they had to disable comments as they can't allow hatred. The New Zealand Herald issued a statement in which it clarified that there were several racist comments owing to which they had to take the extreme step. \"We appreciate the high level of interest in this story but cannot safely moderate it at this time,\" the news outlet said in a post in the comment thread.\"We want to foster a safe online community by reducing instances of hate, racism, abuse and misinformation.

Radio New Zealand had to do the same on the social media post on Ravishankar's appointment. \"Under RNZ's comments policy, we will proactively disable comments on posts which may attract abusive or harmful comments or when resources are required elsewhere,\" a spokesperson for RNZ said. \"In this instance, the comments were disabled after our monitoring found racist comments,\" the spokesperson said. \"We want people to feel safe and respected on our community forums and will continue to proactively disable comments where necessary.

After her TikTok video went viral, another ICE official offered help. Chatterjee highlights the broader issue of poor ICE communication, impacting immigrants facing detention and difficult bond policies, leading some to abandon their asylum claims. Trisha Chatterjee (Picture source: LinkedIn) Trisha Chatterjee, an Indian-origin immigration lawyer in Ohio, has alleged she was given the number of a Taco Bell outlet when she called ICE for urgent client support. Chatterjee posted about the incident on TikTok, where it went viral and ultimately led to help from another ICE official. But she says the larger issue lack of clear access to immigration authorities continues to cause serious harm to her clients.\"I called and they answered and they said, 'Hello, Taco Bell?' And I said, 'Taco Bell?' And the guy who was working said, 'Yeah, Taco Bell. Ma'am, you called me,\" Chatterjee recalled.\"I was in such disbelief,\" she said. \"So, I called the ICE officer back, just really frustrated with what had just happened. He says, 'Oh, I'm sorry. I was trying to lighten the mood and make you laugh.'\"ICE has denied the accusation. Homeland security called it a \u201clie and a smear.\u201d Chatterjee stood by her version of events.Who is Trisha Chatterjee? Trisha Chatterjee is an Indian-origin immigration lawyer based in Greater Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio. She graduated from Miami University in 2020 and the University of Dayton School of Law in 2023.She works with the law office of Emily Feliz Garcia, a small immigration firm in Springdale. Before this, she worked at Abdallah law offices.For the last two years, she has handled immigration cases, especially those involving clients detained at the Butler County Jail in Ohio, which has a contract with ICE.Chatterjee was trying to submit \"stay of removal\" applications\u2014urgent paperwork that can pause deportation for clients with pending immigration cases. ICE requires these to be submitted in person at the Detroit field office, but she hoped to file them locally in Blue Ash.After being unable to reach anyone by phone or email, she finally spoke to an ICE officer who gave her a phone number that turned out to be for Taco Bell. When she called back, the officer reportedly said he was trying to make her laugh.She posted a video about the incident on TikTok, which gained over 38,000 views. Many users sympathised, and one even helped her connect with a helpful ICE official in Blue Ash, who is now assisting her.Chatterjee said the larger problem is the lack of access and communication with ICE. She also highlighted how a stricter bond policy is making it harder for immigrants to stay out of detention during legal proceedings. Bonds can cost up to $50,000 and must be paid upfront.According to Chatterjee, some clients are abandoning their asylum cases or choosing to self-deport out of fear. She mentioned recent local arrests of people attending ICE check-ins, which has only deepened anxiety in immigrant communities.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The DY Patil Stadium will now host five matches in the tournament, which comprise the three league matches (Bangladesh versus Sri Lanka match on Oct 20, India versus New Zealand clash on Oct 23, India versus Bangladesh match on Oct 26, the second semifinal on Oct 30 and potentially the final (provided that Pakistan don't make it to the summit clash) of the 13th edition of the Women's ODI World Cup on Nov 2. The opening match of the tournament, between hosts India and Sri Lanka, will now be held on Sept 30 in Guwahati. The rest of the schedule of the tournament remains unchanged.This will be the first-ever ICC tournament to be staged at the world-class DY Patil Stadium, which has witnessed a full house (45,000 capacity crowd) for Women's international matches in recent years-the 20022 India versus Australia T20I series being a prime example. The DY Patil Stadium had staged 11 matches of the inaugural season of the Women's Premier League in March 2023. The state of the art stadium also hosted Indian Premier League (IPL) finals in 2008 and 2010, when the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai was undergoing massive renovation.Endorsing the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai as \"a genuine home for women's cricket,\" ICC chairman Jay Shah said, \u201cNavi Mumbai has emerged as a genuine home for women\u2019s cricket in recent years. The support it has received during international fixtures and the Women\u2019s Premier League has been remarkable, creating an atmosphere that elevates the players and inspires fans. I am certain that the same energy will define the big matches of the ICC Women\u2019s Cricket World Cup as it returns to India after 12 years.\" \u201cWe stand at a pivotal moment in the journey of the women\u2019s game. This World Cup has the potential to be remembered as one of those defining milestones that shaped the sport\u2019s future, not only in India but across the cricketing world. While unforeseen circumstances required us to adjust the schedule and replace a venue, we are pleased to now have a line-up of five world-class venues that will showcase the very best of the women\u2019s game.

It had been reported by the media that Thiruvananthapuram too is a favourite for the displaced games, but again, Kerala experiences relentless rain at that time of the year. The only glitch is that Mumbai too experiences incessant rain till the end of Sept, but the monsoon should relent when the tournament moves to Navi Mumbai on Oct 23. Last Monday, the ICC marked the 50-day countdown to the tournament with an event in Mumbai.The uncertainty over Bengaluru matches led the ICC to delay the ticket sales for the matches of the tournament too.The Chinnaswamy Stadium was initially allotted five games of the 2025 Women's World Cup. Besides the tournament opener, the other league games originally slotted to Bengaluru were England-South Africa (on October 3), India-Bangladesh (on October 26), and then the two knockout matches. However, things became difficult, with the State Government toughening its stand towards cricket matches at the Chinnaswamy Stadium following the stampede tragedy. The Karnataka government recently did not give permission for the Maharaja Cup which had to be shifted to Mysuru.The eight competing teams for the Women's World Cup are Australia, England, South Africa, New Zealand, Bangladesh and Pakistan besides hosts India and Sri Lanka.

Taylor Swift and Kevin Pietersen (Images via AP & Screengrab/YouTube) Pop icon Taylor Swift once admitted to being baffled by cricket during an appearance on The Graham Norton Show, where she shared the couch with former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen. The exchange, which aired in 2014, resurfaced for the singer\u2019s candid and light-heartedly hilarious remarks about the sport. At the time, Pietersen was promoting his autobiography KP: The Autobiography, which revisited the infamous \u201ctextgate\u201d controversy of 2012. The former England batter faced pointed questions from Norton about sending provocative messages to members of the South African team during a Test series, a scandal that tainted his relationship with then-captain Andrew Strauss.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

        "input": "Joe Burns recalls his debut Boxing Day Test in 2014 against India, where a brief attempt to sledge Virat Kohli backfired spectacularly. Kohli, then emerging as India's Test captain, silenced Burns with a sharp retort and a boundary. Burns learned a valuable lesson about engaging with the fierce competitor, whose leadership shaped India's aggressive cricketing identity. Virat Kohli (X) Former Australia batter and current Italy captain Joe Burns recently shared his experience of encountering Virat Kohli during the 2014-15 Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, where Kohli delivered a sharp response to Burns\u2019 attempt at sledging during his debut match. The incident took place during India\u2019s tour of Australia, which also marked Kohli\u2019s emergence as India\u2019s Test leader following MS Dhoni\u2019s retirement after the Melbourne Test. During the Boxing Day clash, Australia had posted 530 runs, and India\u2019s reply was led by Kohli\u2019s brilliant 169. Burns, who was fielding at bat-pad, recalled trying to engage with Kohli after staying silent for four hours.How Virat Kohli & Ravi Shastri sparked India's Test revolution | Insights from Bharat Arun | #BSEGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! \u201cIn my first game, first Test match at the MCG on Boxing Day, I was 24. I was fielding at bat-pad (close to the batter). Virat scored a hundred that day. There was a bit of chirp going on, not sledging, just the usual with Hadzi (Brad Haddin) behind the stumps and Watto (Shane Watson) at first slip. Nathan Lyon was bowling and I was in close. After four hours of silence, I finally said one line to him: \u2018Virat, you\u2019ve got to play some shots,\u2019\u201d Burns recounted. Kohli\u2019s response was immediate and unforgettable. Burns described the moment: \u201cHe stopped Nathan Lyon mid-run, turned to me and said, \u2018You don\u2019t talk, rookie.\u2019 The very next ball, he smacked it through covers. It was very embarrassing for me. I didn\u2019t say a word for the next four days, but it showed me Virat was not someone to mess with. As a 24-year-old debutant at bat-pad, I realised I picked the wrong player and the wrong time to speak,\u201d he told CricTracker.PollWhich aspect of Kohli's game do you admire the most?His batting skillsHis leadership qualitiesHis competitive nature The 2014-15 tour proved significant for Kohli, who amassed 692 runs in eight innings, including four centuries. The series cemented his leadership credentials as he stepped in for Dhoni, who missed the first match and later announced his retirement. Reflecting on Kohli\u2019s impact, Burns said: \u201cVirat Kohli doesn\u2019t take a backward step. He really shaped that team\u2019s identity. Even now, when he\u2019s not in the team, you can see India still play in the mould of what he built over the years. He was always a fierce competitor. Personally, I tried not to look at him on the field because I knew that spurred him on.\u201d Burns, who recently led Italy to their maiden T20 World Cup qualification, added: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to engage with him because he thrived on that. He\u2019s a world-class batter, one of the greatest of all time. That combination of skill and competitiveness defined him, and it set the tone for Indian cricket.\u201d Kohli\u2019s career statistics underline his greatness, with 9,230 runs in 123 Test matches. The incident with Burns during the Boxing Day Test was a small but telling example of Kohli\u2019s ability to respond to challenges with both words and performance.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

        "input": "USA Cricket has ended its agreement with American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), the force behind Major League Cricket, leading to uncertainty surrounding World Cup preparations and financial stability. The decision, driven by board members, raises concerns about potential bankruptcy due to the loss of ACE's financial support, which has totalled over $10 million since 2019. A fan watches a cricket match during the third season of Major League Cricket in USA. (Sportzpics) USA Cricket has formally terminated its 50-year agreement with American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), the company behind Major League Cricket, following a three-hour board meeting, reported Cricbuzz. The decision, supported by Chairman Venu Pisike and a faction of board members, has created uncertainty around World Cup preparations and financial stability for the organisation that has been under ICC suspension since July 2024.The termination notice was initiated by Chairman Venu Pisike and Board Member David Haubert, gaining support from Srini Salver, Anj Balusu, and Pintoo Shah. This group outvoted opposing directors Nadia Gruny, Kuljit Nijjar, Atul Rai, and Arjun Gona.Major League Cricket 2025 Explained: Teams, Schedule & Where to WatchThe original partnership, established in June 2019, granted ACE exclusive rights to operate a premier T20 league in the United States and manage the commercialisation of national teams and cricket infrastructure development.USA Cricket CEO Johnathan Atkeison and legal counsel present at the meeting expressed concerns about the decision. The board's legal counsel indicated that the termination might not withstand arbitration, while an external attorney reportedly labeled the decision as \"reckless.\"The financial implications of this decision are significant. Sources indicate that USA Cricket could face bankruptcy within weeks without ACE's quarterly payments. Since 2019, ACE has provided over $10 million in support for sanction fees, operating costs, and player payments.The dispute primarily focuses on the management and finances of the US National Team. USA Cricket has expressed their desire for Major League Cricket to continue operations, noting that MLC's ICC sanction removes dependency on USA Cricket for continuity.The termination impacts immediate preparation plans for the World Cup. A $700,000 budget and access to MLC venues in Dallas and Morrisville were being arranged to support preparatory fixtures for National Men's, Women's, and Junior programs, including matches against West Indies A and West Indies Women's team in October.The conflict escalated on June 23 when USA Cricket issued a termination warning citing various alleged breaches by ACE. The entity responded in July by addressing these claims point by point, but USA Cricket proceeded with the termination notice without further communication.According to documents reviewed by Cricbuzz, only two claims qualify as material breaches under the termination clause: failure to pay yearly minimum guarantees and failure to construct a high-performance centre. Bank records show ACE has maintained quarterly minimum-guarantee payments.In response to the high-performance centre requirements, ACE stated in their July communication that the facility in Grand Prairie was developed in consultation with USA Cricket leadership. They noted that it \"exceeds the standards of high performance centres of most other ICC Associate nations, and has even been deemed of sufficient standard for the ICC to conduct World Cup matches in 2024.\"Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal India\u2019s Asia Cup 2025 squad has stirred debate after the omission of star opener Yashasvi Jaiswal, leaving fans and former cricketers questioning the selection choices. Shubman Gill returns to the T20I squad for the first time since July 2024, and the BCCI has handed him the vice-captaincy role, a clear sign of faith in the youngster\u2019s leadership. Jaiswal, who has been a key figure in India\u2019s T20 set-up, was named among the reserve players despite his impressive record. He has scored 723 runs in 23 T20Is, including a century and five fifties at a strike rate of over 164. In the IPL 2025, he continued his excellent form, scoring 559 runs in 14 matches with six half-centuries at a strike rate of 160.

But what about Yashasvi Jaiswal? He has done even better than Shubman Gill. Also, why has Sai Sudharsan missed out after scoring 700 runs in IPL 2025 and performing better than Shubman Gill? Sanju Samson himself is now in doubt to start in the playing 11,\u201d Badrinath said on his YouTube channel.PollDo you agree with the exclusion of Yashasvi Jaiswal from India's Asia Cup 2025 squad?Yes, it was the right decision.No, he should have been included. Badrinath further questioned whether the selection was influenced by recency bias, a trend often seen in Indian cricket where players performing well in the immediate past are preferred, even if their overall numbers are stronger. He added, \u201cSo while backing Shubman Gill, you ask what wrong have Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sai Sudharsan done when their numbers are better than Gill\u2019s. It\u2019s not a bad decision but one that\u2019s 50-50.\u201dWhile Shubman Gill\u2019s leadership and experience are valued, many feel that Yashasvi Jaiswal\u2019s consistency and impact make him deserving of a more prominent role. Most likely, India will open the innings with Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma, leaving the middle order to accommodate other key batters, including Sanju Samson, who may have to adapt to a new role.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Dravid jokingly mentioned the criticism he received, suggesting Ashwin's coaching was perceived as superior. Ashwin defended himself, while recalling Mitchell Starc's playful reference to the video during the Indore Test. R Ashwin and Rahul Dravid  NEW DELHI: Former India head coach Rahul Dravid and senior spinner Ravichandran Ashwin revisited a controversial moment from the 2023 Border-Gavaskar Trophy during the latest episode of Kutti Stories with Ash. The incident revolved around Ashwin facing backlash for allegedly helping Australia through a Tamil-language YouTube video on playing spin in India.The controversy erupted after Ashwin uploaded the video following Australia\u2019s defeat in the second Test. The criticism intensified when India lost the third Test at Indore, with social media users accusing Ashwin of \u201ccoaching\u201d the opposition. The channel was eventually forced to change the video\u2019s thumbnail.Rahul Dravid reflects on RR's narrow losses: 'One or two hits away in every game'Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Dravid light-heartedly brought up the episode with Ashwin.\"You even coached the Australian team. I got sent a clip. Unfortunately, it was in Tamil. So that's the one I've seen about you. You're speaking in Tamil and with a little bit of Tamil that I understand, you're coaching the Australian team in the middle of the Australian series, how to play spin. And I'm thinking, Ash, the series is not over,\" Dravid said.Ashwin responded in his defence: \"If I knew how to do that, I would have told our boys how to play spin. I mean, why would I go and tell the Aussies?\"Dravid admitted he was joking but also revealed he too had faced flak at the time. \"The flak I got was 'Ashwin is coaching better than you are \u2014 what are you doing?'\" he said with a laugh.PollDo you think Ashwin's YouTube video gave Australia an unfair advantage?Yes, it definitely helped themNo, it was just a learning resourceAshwin also recalled a conversation with Mitchell Starc during the Indore Test: \"An interesting thing was that (Mitchell) Starc came and told me. I mean, he bowled a bumper, and I just left it in the Indore Test match. I think we were 80 for 7 or something. We went for lunch, and he was walking with me. He was like, 'Can I tell you how to play the bouncer like your YouTube video?'\"Dravid further joked that the Australians might have found a translator: \"It's good to know that Starc knows Tamil.

Despite domestic success and WPL flair, she struggles in ODIs, averaging just 23. Pratika Rawal replaced her, capitalizing on opportunities. Shafali Verma (Photo by Chris Hyde/Getty Images) Chennai: In Jan 2023, when Shafali Verma hoisted the Under-19 Women\u2019s T20 World Cup trophy in South Africa, with tears of joy, she said: \u201cThis is just the beginning.\u201d The journey from that \u201cbeginning,\u201d though, turned far bumpier than the young opening batter could have imagined, culminating in her getting dropped from the India squad for the ODI World Cup at home starting in September.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! With lean returns in ODIs and a dismal show at home against New Zealand, the axe fell in Nov last year. Shafali was dropped from the ODI squad for the Australia tour and remained out of favour. Her last half-century came in 2022. When the door closed, Shafali turned to domestic cricket and emerged as the leading run-scorer in a format that has troubled her the most. She piled up 527 runs at a strike rate of 152.31 in the One-dayers for Haryana, including a 197 off 115 balls. In March, donning Delhi Capitals jersey in the WPL, she finished as the fourth-highest run-getter overall. In July this year, Shafali roared back in Indian colours and showed flashes of her swagger during the T20I series in England. For all her flair in the shortest format, ODIs remain Shafali\u2019s unsolved puzzle. The batter has managed an average of 23 in 29 matches, and on the recent India A tour of Australia, her performance was underwhelming. So, when her name went missing from the upcoming home ODI World Cup squad, it hardly raised eyebrows. In her place came Pratika Rawal, who made her debut last year, and has made her case with steady returns at an average of 54. The 21-year-old Shafali needs to crack the 50-over format, according to WV Raman, who was India women\u2019s head coach when a 15-year-old Shafali first broke into the scene. Shafali was India\u2019s leading run-getter in the 2020 T20 World Cup, a campaign where India went all the way to the final under Raman\u2019s watch. \u201cShe has to work her way back into the team by working on her shortcomings. Basically, she needs to put up consistent performances in the 50-over format as Pratika has grabbed her opportunities and displaced Shafali.PollDo you think Shafali Verma will make a successful comeback to the ODI squad?Yes, she has the talentNo, she needs more timeI\u2019m not sure \u201cThe other area that needs improvement is her fielding. What is important is for her is to fight her way back into the team. And she was given a fair bit of leeway when she started. A setback is always good to make a strong comeback,\u201d Raman told TOI. Shafali, who as a kid once walked into an under-12 all-boys local tournament and walked out with the \u2018Man of the Match\u2019 and \u2018Man of the Series\u2019 medal, has always carried the same audacity to the international stage. Today, even as she faces the first big setback of her international career, the fierce and spunky prodigy still has age and time to turn things around.

Besides the tournament opener, the other league games originally slotted to Bengaluru were England-South Africa (on October 3), India-Bangladesh (on October 26), and then the two knockout matches. However, things became difficult, with the State Government toughening its stand towards cricket matches at the Chinnaswamy Stadium following the stampede tragedy.

Matthew Breetzke and Navjot Singh Sidhu South Africa batter Matthew Breetzke etched his name in the record books on Friday, becoming the first cricketer in ODI history to begin his career with four consecutive scores of fifty or more.

SUBSCRIBE NOW!The milestone saw Breetzke go past former India star Navjot Singh Sidhu, who struck four consecutive half-centuries at the 1987 World Cup. However, while Sidhu took five matches to achieve the landmark, Breetzke needed just four, underlining the scale of his achievement.EXCLUSIVE: India to boycott Pakistan in Asia Cup? Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'Breetzke had already announced himself in international cricket with a record-breaking 150 on ODI debut against New Zealand earlier this year, the highest score by any batter in their first match.

However, since he did not bat in his third match against Zimbabwe, it had taken him five ODIs to achieve the feat.Coming in at No. 4 after South Africa lost both openers cheaply to Xavier Bartlett, Breetzke steadied the innings with partnerships alongside Tony de Zorzi (38) and Tristan Stubbs (74 off 87). His innings included eight boundaries and two sixes, and though he fell just 12 runs short of a second century, his contribution was pivotal in guiding the Proteas to a competitive 277 in 49.1 overs.Australia\u2019s Adam Zampa (3/63) and Nathan Ellis (2/46) ensured South Africa couldn\u2019t push beyond 300, but Breetzke\u2019s landmark will stand out as the talking point of the day. With the Proteas leading the three-match series 1-0, his record-setting innings has now placed them in a strong position to seal the contest.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

The decision, driven by board members, raises concerns about potential bankruptcy due to the loss of ACE's financial support, which has totalled over $10 million since 2019. A fan watches a cricket match during the third season of Major League Cricket in USA. (Sportzpics) USA Cricket has formally terminated its 50-year agreement with American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), the company behind Major League Cricket, following a three-hour board meeting, reported Cricbuzz. The decision, supported by Chairman Venu Pisike and a faction of board members, has created uncertainty around World Cup preparations and financial stability for the organisation that has been under ICC suspension since July 2024.The termination notice was initiated by Chairman Venu Pisike and Board Member David Haubert, gaining support from Srini Salver, Anj Balusu, and Pintoo Shah. This group outvoted opposing directors Nadia Gruny, Kuljit Nijjar, Atul Rai, and Arjun Gona.Major League Cricket 2025 Explained: Teams, Schedule & Where to WatchThe original partnership, established in June 2019, granted ACE exclusive rights to operate a premier T20 league in the United States and manage the commercialisation of national teams and cricket infrastructure development.USA Cricket CEO Johnathan Atkeison and legal counsel present at the meeting expressed concerns about the decision. The board's legal counsel indicated that the termination might not withstand arbitration, while an external attorney reportedly labeled the decision as \"reckless.\"The financial implications of this decision are significant. Sources indicate that USA Cricket could face bankruptcy within weeks without ACE's quarterly payments. Since 2019, ACE has provided over $10 million in support for sanction fees, operating costs, and player payments.The dispute primarily focuses on the management and finances of the US National Team. USA Cricket has expressed their desire for Major League Cricket to continue operations, noting that MLC's ICC sanction removes dependency on USA Cricket for continuity.The termination impacts immediate preparation plans for the World Cup. A $700,000 budget and access to MLC venues in Dallas and Morrisville were being arranged to support preparatory fixtures for National Men's, Women's, and Junior programs, including matches against West Indies A and West Indies Women's team in October.The conflict escalated on June 23 when USA Cricket issued a termination warning citing various alleged breaches by ACE. The entity responded in July by addressing these claims point by point, but USA Cricket proceeded with the termination notice without further communication.According to documents reviewed by Cricbuzz, only two claims qualify as material breaches under the termination clause: failure to pay yearly minimum guarantees and failure to construct a high-performance centre. Bank records show ACE has maintained quarterly minimum-guarantee payments.In response to the high-performance centre requirements, ACE stated in their July communication that the facility in Grand Prairie was developed in consultation with USA Cricket leadership. They noted that it \"exceeds the standards of high performance centres of most other ICC Associate nations, and has even been deemed of sufficient standard for the ICC to conduct World Cup matches in 2024.\"Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Kohli, then emerging as India's Test captain, silenced Burns with a sharp retort and a boundary. Burns learned a valuable lesson about engaging with the fierce competitor, whose leadership shaped India's aggressive cricketing identity. Virat Kohli (X) Former Australia batter and current Italy captain Joe Burns recently shared his experience of encountering Virat Kohli during the 2014-15 Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, where Kohli delivered a sharp response to Burns\u2019 attempt at sledging during his debut match. The incident took place during India\u2019s tour of Australia, which also marked Kohli\u2019s emergence as India\u2019s Test leader following MS Dhoni\u2019s retirement after the Melbourne Test. During the Boxing Day clash, Australia had posted 530 runs, and India\u2019s reply was led by Kohli\u2019s brilliant 169. Burns, who was fielding at bat-pad, recalled trying to engage with Kohli after staying silent for four hours.How Virat Kohli & Ravi Shastri sparked India's Test revolution | Insights from Bharat Arun | #BSEGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! \u201cIn my first game, first Test match at the MCG on Boxing Day, I was 24. I was fielding at bat-pad (close to the batter). Virat scored a hundred that day. There was a bit of chirp going on, not sledging, just the usual with Hadzi (Brad Haddin) behind the stumps and Watto (Shane Watson) at first slip. Nathan Lyon was bowling and I was in close. After four hours of silence, I finally said one line to him: \u2018Virat, you\u2019ve got to play some shots,\u2019\u201d Burns recounted. Kohli\u2019s response was immediate and unforgettable. Burns described the moment: \u201cHe stopped Nathan Lyon mid-run, turned to me and said, \u2018You don\u2019t talk, rookie.\u2019 The very next ball, he smacked it through covers. It was very embarrassing for me. I didn\u2019t say a word for the next four days, but it showed me Virat was not someone to mess with. As a 24-year-old debutant at bat-pad, I realised I picked the wrong player and the wrong time to speak,\u201d he told CricTracker.PollWhich aspect of Kohli's game do you admire the most?His batting skillsHis leadership qualitiesHis competitive nature The 2014-15 tour proved significant for Kohli, who amassed 692 runs in eight innings, including four centuries. The series cemented his leadership credentials as he stepped in for Dhoni, who missed the first match and later announced his retirement. Reflecting on Kohli\u2019s impact, Burns said: \u201cVirat Kohli doesn\u2019t take a backward step. He really shaped that team\u2019s identity. Even now, when he\u2019s not in the team, you can see India still play in the mould of what he built over the years. He was always a fierce competitor. Personally, I tried not to look at him on the field because I knew that spurred him on.\u201d Burns, who recently led Italy to their maiden T20 World Cup qualification, added: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to engage with him because he thrived on that. He\u2019s a world-class batter, one of the greatest of all time. That combination of skill and competitiveness defined him, and it set the tone for Indian cricket.\u201d Kohli\u2019s career statistics underline his greatness, with 9,230 runs in 123 Test matches. The incident with Burns during the Boxing Day Test was a small but telling example of Kohli\u2019s ability to respond to challenges with both words and performance.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Badrinath further questioned whether the selection was influenced by recency bias, a trend often seen in Indian cricket where players performing well in the immediate past are preferred, even if their overall numbers are stronger. He added, \u201cSo while backing Shubman Gill, you ask what wrong have Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sai Sudharsan done when their numbers are better than Gill\u2019s. It\u2019s not a bad decision but one that\u2019s 50-50.\u201dWhile Shubman Gill\u2019s leadership and experience are valued, many feel that Yashasvi Jaiswal\u2019s consistency and impact make him deserving of a more prominent role. Most likely, India will open the innings with Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma, leaving the middle order to accommodate other key batters, including Sanju Samson, who may have to adapt to a new role.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

        "input": "The US Open mixed doubles event had many winners - Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori as champions while carrying the mantle for the doubles specialists. And the USTA in bringing thousands of fans to an otherwise ignored competition. But teething problems cannot be ignored. Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori kiss the trophy after winning the revamped US Open mixed doubles title. (AP) When Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori stepped on to the court at Flushing Meadows, they weren\u2019t just defending their US Open mixed doubles title. They were fighting for doubles specialists everywhere as the event had been overhauled into a 16-team \u2018spectacle\u2019 starring singles superstars, backed by $1 million prize money and a radical Fast4 tennis format.Unseeded and wildcards Errani and Vavassori were injected into a field that had numerous headline acts. Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner, Aryna Sabalenka (both withdrew), Novak Djokovic, Taylor Fritz, Iga Swiatek, Emma Raducanu, Jessica Pegula and Madison Keys were some of the big names involved.But the winners were still to be crowned Grand Slam champions and that\u2019s what irked doubles specialists who couldn't be part of the event and not by choice.Unsurprisingly, there was an outcry. Jamie Murray dismissed it as \"a glorified exhibition.\" Errani-Vavassori had said in a joint statement that it was \"pseudo-exhibition\" and \u201cprofound injustice\u201d which \u201cdisrespect(s) an entire category of players.\u201dRather hilariously, Casper Ruud, who has lost three major singles finals, was positioned as someone chasing their maiden Grand Slam title.\"I know it created a lot of reaction and [it was] somewhat bold to do it,\" said Ruud on United States Tennis Association's (USTA) move to upend the event that gets largely ignored otherwise. \"You can't argue that it's not been great for the fans.\"Casper Ruud plays with Iga Swiatek during the mixed doubles final at the US Open tennis championships. (AP)If the objective was to draw fans, bring attention to the event that otherwise gets lost and ignored and get viewers hooked to the TV, one can reasonably argue that the goal has been met.But at what cost? The 138-year tradition was ripped apart. As was the chance for many doubles specialists to win a major tournament, including this year's Wimbledon champions Sam Verbeek and Katerina Siniakova. To add to the injustice of it all, doubles World No. 2 Siniakova was withdrawn from the draw at the last minute when her partner Sinner pulled out late. By then, she had skipped Cleveland to play the US Open.In the end, as far as polarising narratives go, the final offered another one. Doubles specialists vs singles specialists. It has been one of the raging arguments in the sport and rarely is it answered with much at stake. And here we were, with plenty riding on it.Sara Errani plays with Andrea Vavassori during the mixed doubles semi-final at the US Open tennis championships. (AP)Both Ruud and Swiatek found it challenging to deal with Errani's 70mph serve as Vavassori moved about at the net to cause distraction. At one point in the second set, Ruud and Swiatek were both guilty of shanking three consecutive forehand returns.Australia's Ellen Perez, a doubles specialist herself, said she had \"never felt more Italian\" as she supported them.The moment Vavassori landed an unpickable return on Swiatek's feet after a 92-minute match, the doubles community had been vindicated. \u201cThis is for all the doubles players who couldn\u2019t play this tournament,\u201d Errani said. Vavassori added: \u201cWe have been on a mission.\u201d\"We showed that doubles is a great product and in the future we need more marketing and visibility,\" Vavassori shot out at the US Open decision-makers.Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu celebrate during their mixed doubles match at the US Open tennis championships. (AP)But the success of the two-day doubles showdown, where singles players seemingly enjoyed, Louis Armstrong and Arthur Ashe Stadium were used and DJs worked overtime, could mean USTA sticks by this structure instead of tinkering with it and introducing more doubles teams for the future.Jack Draper and Karolina Muchova called it an 'exhibition' - a word that is disparagingly used by athletes. On the opening day, it appeared to be the case. With two courts in use, giant screens showing the other match as well and attention being dragged, the quality felt laboured. The semi-finals and final turned that notion around with a more serious feel to it.PollHow do you feel about the decision to feature singles players in the mixed doubles event?It's a great idea for visibility.It undermines doubles specialists.It should remain separate.If the US Open continues with the mixed doubles event for the future, it must come with some much-needed changes. As far as the playing field is concerned, bringing in champions from three other majors could be an idea worth exploring to not just address the concerns of the doubles specialists but also make things even more interesting on the doubles vs singles quotient.Additionally, the tournament needs better organisation and coordination. Sabalenka and Gauff pulled out to hurt the hype train. Cincinnati Open finished mere hours before the mixed event got underway in New York and an ill Sinner withdrew while Swiatek barely made it in time.Caty McNally had just 60 seconds to agree to a partner. \u201cSunday night I was home in Cincinnati and my agent called me, and he said you have 60 seconds to tell me if you want to play with Lorenzo Musetti.\u201dMany teams didn't even practice together before taking to court, which could explain the comic point involving Andrey Rublev and Muchova. Naomi Osaka played her first round match, alongside Gael Monfils, in a practice kit.The obvious exceptions to this all were the Italians Errani and Vavassori who needed 42, 56, 44 and 92 minutes, respectively, to win the title. It is worth reminding that the duo, who have won 12 major titles, were unseeded and needed a wildcard to get in.As the beaten finalist Swiatek said: \u201cYou proved that mixed doubles players are smarter tactically than singles players, I guess.\u201dFor now, as far as mic drop moments go, Errani and Vavassori had delivered it - embarrassed the US Open organisers, successfully defended their title against the best singles players in the world and walked off with a cool million dollars.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Dravid jokingly mentioned the criticism he received, suggesting Ashwin's coaching was perceived as superior. Ashwin defended himself, while recalling Mitchell Starc's playful reference to the video during the Indore Test. R Ashwin and Rahul Dravid  NEW DELHI: Former India head coach Rahul Dravid and senior spinner Ravichandran Ashwin revisited a controversial moment from the 2023 Border-Gavaskar Trophy during the latest episode of Kutti Stories with Ash. The incident revolved around Ashwin facing backlash for allegedly helping Australia through a Tamil-language YouTube video on playing spin in India.The controversy erupted after Ashwin uploaded the video following Australia\u2019s defeat in the second Test. The criticism intensified when India lost the third Test at Indore, with social media users accusing Ashwin of \u201ccoaching\u201d the opposition. The channel was eventually forced to change the video\u2019s thumbnail.Rahul Dravid reflects on RR's narrow losses: 'One or two hits away in every game'Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Dravid light-heartedly brought up the episode with Ashwin.\"You even coached the Australian team. I got sent a clip. Unfortunately, it was in Tamil. So that's the one I've seen about you. You're speaking in Tamil and with a little bit of Tamil that I understand, you're coaching the Australian team in the middle of the Australian series, how to play spin. And I'm thinking, Ash, the series is not over,\" Dravid said.Ashwin responded in his defence: \"If I knew how to do that, I would have told our boys how to play spin. I mean, why would I go and tell the Aussies?\"Dravid admitted he was joking but also revealed he too had faced flak at the time. \"The flak I got was 'Ashwin is coaching better than you are \u2014 what are you doing?'\" he said with a laugh.PollDo you think Ashwin's YouTube video gave Australia an unfair advantage?Yes, it definitely helped themNo, it was just a learning resourceAshwin also recalled a conversation with Mitchell Starc during the Indore Test: \"An interesting thing was that (Mitchell) Starc came and told me. I mean, he bowled a bumper, and I just left it in the Indore Test match. I think we were 80 for 7 or something. We went for lunch, and he was walking with me. He was like, 'Can I tell you how to play the bouncer like your YouTube video?'\"Dravid further joked that the Australians might have found a translator: \"It's good to know that Starc knows Tamil. I think it was maybe the Australian guys got some Tamil guy to sort of...\" he said, before Ashwin clarified that the video carried subtitles.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Her regimen includes a revised diet, evenly distributed workload, and enhanced recovery methods like massages and ice baths. Chanu aims to excel at the Commonwealth Weightlifting Championship and the 2026 Asian Games. PARIS, FRANCE - AUGUST 07: Mirabai Chanu Saikhom of Team India (Photo by Lars Baron/Getty Images) In the high-stakes world of weightlifting, where every gram and every lift matters, Saikhom Mirabai Chanu is leaving nothing to chance. Ahead of the Commonwealth Weightlifting Championship in Ahmedabad, which serves as a qualifier for next year\u2019s Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, the star lifter from Manipur has undertaken a comprehensive overhaul of her training regimen. With renewed focus on diet, recovery and workload management, the 31-year-old is embracing a change prompted by an overhaul in international competition rules. In June, the International Weightlifting Federation revised its weight categories, scrapping the women\u2019s 49kg division \u2014 a class in which Mirabai has competed for the past seven years, and in which she famously won silver at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. She also holds the clean and jerk world record in that category, lifting 119kg at the 2021 Asian Championship.

Now, Mirabai returns to the women\u2019s 48kg category \u2014 a division where she first announced her arrival on the global stage by winning silver at the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games. In many ways, it\u2019s a homecoming of sorts, but one that demands significant physical and strategic adaptation. \u201cWhile it may seem like just a 1kg drop, it takes a serious toll on the body,\u201d her long-time coach, Vijay Sharma, told TOI. \u201cWe had the option to move up to 53kg or come down to 48kg. We chose the latter as it better suits her natural weight.\u201d Sharma and assistant coach-cum-dietician AP Datthan went back to the drawing board two months ago to completely rewire Mirabai\u2019s training strategy, aiming to maximize her performance without risking injury. Rather than pushing her through heavy single-session lifts, her daily load \u2014 totaling around 12 to 14 tonnes \u2014 is now spread evenly throughout the day. \u201cThis method keeps each workout manageable and gives her body time to recover properly,\u201d said Sharma. \u201cRecovery is the key. Spreading the workload helps her adapt better, stay fresh and maintain strength,\u201d he elaborated. Dathan has calibrated Mirabai\u2019s diet, increasing her protein intake to aid muscle repair and prevent muscle loss, while reducing carbohydrates. \u201cHigh-protein foods like lean meat, eggs, lentils and dairy feature prominently, with complex carbs like whole grains and vegetables,\u201d Dathan said. Recovery strategies extend beyond training and nutrition. Mirabai now undergoes regular massages, ice baths and sauna treatment at least twice a week to reduce inflammation and ease muscle soreness, supported by a dedicated female masseuse. With her support team\u2019s unwavering attention to detail, Mirabai is optimistic about her prospects in the new weight category. Following the Commonwealth Weightlifting Championship in Ahmedabad, she will gear up for the World Championships in October. While the Commonwealth Games remains vital to her plans, Mirabai is focused on the 2026 Asian Games in Japan \u2014 the only major multi-sport event where she is yet to win a medal. Injuries derailed her campaigns at both the 2018 and 2023 editions, making this event the elusive goal.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4. Watch Here!",

Despite domestic success and WPL flair, she struggles in ODIs, averaging just 23. Pratika Rawal replaced her, capitalizing on opportunities. Shafali Verma (Photo by Chris Hyde/Getty Images) Chennai: In Jan 2023, when Shafali Verma hoisted the Under-19 Women\u2019s T20 World Cup trophy in South Africa, with tears of joy, she said: \u201cThis is just the beginning.\u201d The journey from that \u201cbeginning,\u201d though, turned far bumpier than the young opening batter could have imagined, culminating in her getting dropped from the India squad for the ODI World Cup at home starting in September.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! With lean returns in ODIs and a dismal show at home against New Zealand, the axe fell in Nov last year. Shafali was dropped from the ODI squad for the Australia tour and remained out of favour. Her last half-century came in 2022. When the door closed, Shafali turned to domestic cricket and emerged as the leading run-scorer in a format that has troubled her the most. She piled up 527 runs at a strike rate of 152.31 in the One-dayers for Haryana, including a 197 off 115 balls. In March, donning Delhi Capitals jersey in the WPL, she finished as the fourth-highest run-getter overall. In July this year, Shafali roared back in Indian colours and showed flashes of her swagger during the T20I series in England. For all her flair in the shortest format, ODIs remain Shafali\u2019s unsolved puzzle. The batter has managed an average of 23 in 29 matches, and on the recent India A tour of Australia, her performance was underwhelming. So, when her name went missing from the upcoming home ODI World Cup squad, it hardly raised eyebrows. In her place came Pratika Rawal, who made her debut last year, and has made her case with steady returns at an average of 54. The 21-year-old Shafali needs to crack the 50-over format, according to WV Raman, who was India women\u2019s head coach when a 15-year-old Shafali first broke into the scene. Shafali was India\u2019s leading run-getter in the 2020 T20 World Cup, a campaign where India went all the way to the final under Raman\u2019s watch. \u201cShe has to work her way back into the team by working on her shortcomings. Basically, she needs to put up consistent performances in the 50-over format as Pratika has grabbed her opportunities and displaced Shafali.PollDo you think Shafali Verma will make a successful comeback to the ODI squad?Yes, she has the talentNo, she needs more timeI\u2019m not sure \u201cThe other area that needs improvement is her fielding. What is important is for her is to fight her way back into the team. And she was given a fair bit of leeway when she started. A setback is always good to make a strong comeback,\u201d Raman told TOI. Shafali, who as a kid once walked into an under-12 all-boys local tournament and walked out with the \u2018Man of the Match\u2019 and \u2018Man of the Series\u2019 medal, has always carried the same audacity to the international stage. Today, even as she faces the first big setback of her international career, the fierce and spunky prodigy still has age and time to turn things around. Shantha Rangaswamy, former chief selector, is confident of Shafali\u2019s comeback. \u201cShe\u2019s very talented but she needs to score consistently. Unless she does that, it won\u2019t be fair to drop Pratika, who has done very well. My advice to her is: \u2018You (Shafali) have age on your side, you are a talented cricketer, you just need to keep building scores consistently.\u2019 I feel she will definitely make a comeback, because she is a huge talent,\u201d said Shantha, the first captain of the Indian women\u2019s cricket team.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Such satellite and ISS imagery is more than just visually dramatic\u2014it provides critical forecasting data for meteorologists tracking Erin\u2019s movement and predicting its potential impact on coastal communities.According to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), Erin was positioned about 285 miles east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, as of 2 pm ET. The storm is sustaining winds of 100 mph with higher gusts.While forecasters expect Erin to gradually weaken into a post-tropical cyclone by August 23, its outer rain bands, storm surge, and high surf continue to disrupt life along the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast coasts.Warnings and advisories across the Atlantic CoastNorth Carolina: Outer banks on high alertThe Outer Banks of North Carolina experienced the closest brush with Hurricane Erin. Tropical storm warnings and storm-surge alerts were issued, with coastal flooding expected to peak during high tide on August 21. Emergency officials advised residents to stay indoors and avoid flood-prone areas.New Jersey: Beaches closed and water activities bannedNew Jersey authorities prohibited swimming, surfing, and boating until at least August 22, citing life-threatening rip currents and dangerous surf conditions. Local lifeguards and emergency services remain vigilant as waves pound the shoreline.New York City: Flooding risks across five boroughsIn New York City, officials issued coastal flood advisories for all five boroughs. Flooding between 1 and 2.5 feet is projected during high tide from August 21 to August 22, with neighborhoods in southern Queens, Brooklyn\u2019s waterfront, Staten Island, Manhattan, and the Bronx most at risk.Officials warned that rising waters could impact homes, businesses, and key roadways, potentially causing significant disruptions.Erin\u2019s impacts extend to Canada: Heavy rain, strong winds, and coastal disruptions expectedAs reported by USA Today, though Erin will weaken over the coming days, its aftereffects won\u2019t stop at the US coastline. The storm is forecast to bring heavy rainfall, strong winds, and turbulent seas as far north as southeastern Canada, impacting parts of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.Communities are urged to prepare for localized flooding, possible power outages, and travel delays as Erin continues its track across the Atlantic.Preparing for Hurricanes: Safety and insurance guidelinesThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) stresses the importance of early preparation during hurricane season. Even when a storm shifts direction, delaying precautions can be costly. Below are key safety and preparedness steps recommended by experts:Develop an evacuation planHouseholds in at-risk zones should map out evacuation routes, designate meeting points, and include an out-of-town contact in case relocation becomes necessary.Assemble disaster suppliesPreparedness kits should contain nonperishable food, bottled water, medications, batteries, flashlights, important documents, and first-aid supplies sufficient for several days.Review your insurance coverageMany homeowners don\u2019t realize that standard insurance policies exclude flood damage. Flood insurance is available through private providers or the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) but carries a 30-day waiting period before coverage begins. Acting early is crucial.Create a family communication planDocument a family communication strategy, including emergency contacts, safe meeting places, and instructions for regrouping if members are separated.Strengthen and secure your homeTo reduce storm damage, residents should trim overhanging trees, install storm shutters, reinforce windows, seal wall openings, and fortify roofs against hurricane-force winds.Also Read | NASA and IBM create \u2018Surya\u2019: Advanced AI for predicting solar storms and strengthening space defenceAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

        "input": "A 120-million-year-old Hyphalosaurus fossil, unearthed in China, reveals a rare case of axial bifurcation, resulting in a two-headed reptile. This remarkable find, published in Biology Letters, represents the oldest known instance of this congenital defect in the vertebrate fossil record. The discovery provides valuable insights into developmental anomalies and evolutionary challenges faced by ancient species. Source: Science Alert A remarkable fossil discovery dating back more than 120 million years has revealed the existence of a two-headed Hyphalosaurus, a small, long-necked aquatic reptile that lived during the Early Cretaceous period. Unearthed in the Yixian Formation of northeastern China, this unique specimen shows clear signs of axial bifurcation, a rare developmental anomaly in which an embryo begins to split into twins but fails to complete the process, resulting in a single organism with two heads.Although similar malformations have been observed in modern-day reptiles such as snakes, lizards, and turtles, this fossil is the oldest known example of such a condition in the vertebrate fossil record. The discovery, published in a 2007 study by Buffetaut and colleagues in Biology Letters, offers important insight into the occurrence of congenital defects in ancient species. It also provides a fascinating glimpse into the biological and evolutionary challenges faced by early reptiles, adding a rare developmental perspective to paleontology and evolutionary biology.Fossil discovery explains axial bifurcation in two-headed hyphalosaurusAxial bifurcation is a rare developmental anomaly that occurs during early embryonic growth, where the vertebral column begins to split longitudinally, resulting in two parallel cervical (neck) series and the formation of two distinct skulls and necks. This incomplete twinning process leads to the development of conjoined heads, a condition that is extremely uncommon in reptiles and other vertebrates. In modern species such as snakes and turtles, axial bifurcation is occasionally observed but usually results in non-viable or short-lived offspring due to complications in mobility, feeding, or organ function.The two-headed Hyphalosaurus fossil discovered in the Yixian Formation provides the earliest known evidence of this phenomenon in the fossil record. Measuring just 70 millimeters in length, the specimen is believed to be either a late-stage embryo or a newborn that did not survive beyond hatching. Despite its brief lifespan, the fossil\u2019s exceptional preservation offers scientists a rare window into congenital malformations in ancient reptiles. It not only demonstrates that such developmental errors occurred as far back as the Early Cretaceous but also opens new avenues for understanding the evolutionary and genetic factors influencing vertebrate development in deep time.Significance of the two-headed hyphalosaurus fossil discoveryThe preservation of this two-headed Hyphalosaurus fossil is an extraordinary stroke of luck, considering that the fossil record captures only a minute fraction of all organisms that once lived. Developmental anomalies like axial bifurcation are rare to begin with, and their fossilization is even more unlikely. What makes this discovery even more remarkable is the specimen\u2019s nearly pristine condition.The fossil remains partially embedded in sediment, and the surrounding stone slab is unbroken, lending strong support to its authenticity, a crucial point given the region's history of fossil forgeries.According to the original 2007 study published in Biology Letters, this fossil represents the oldest confirmed case of axial bifurcation in any vertebrate. Its discovery not only sheds light on rare congenital conditions in ancient reptiles but also expands our understanding of how such anomalies have occurred throughout evolutionary history. It serves as a rare and valuable reference point for studying embryonic development, mutation, and survivability in extinct species.The Hyphalosaurus fossil discovery underscores the rarity of axial bifurcation and the value of well-preserved specimens in studying prehistoric life. While modern examples of two-headed reptiles exist, this dinosaur-age fossil offers a unique glimpse into evolutionary development and the challenges of survival for such anomalies. It highlights how rare and complex such conditions are in nature, providing scientists with crucial insights into developmental biology, genetic mutations, and how these factors may have impacted the behavior and longevity of ancient species.By examining fossils like this, scientists gain deeper insight into the diversity and complexity of life millions of years ago, emphasizing the continuing importance of paleontology in uncovering nature\u2019s ancient mysteries.Also read| 26-million-year-old whale skull fossil found, sheds light on ancient marine lifeAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

        "input": "Recent research indicates Mercury is shrinking, with its radius decreasing by 2.7 to 5.6 kilometers due to core cooling. This contraction forms thrust faults and scarps on the surface. A new measurement method focusing on major faults provides a more accurate understanding of Mercury's geological history, revealing insights into planetary evolution.  Mercury, the smallest planet in our solar system, has captivated scientists due to its extreme temperatures, dense iron-rich core, magnetic field, and distinctive geological features. Recent research reveals that Mercury is gradually shrinking over time, a process driven by the cooling and contraction of its deep interior layers. As the planet\u2019s core loses heat, the rigid outer crust adjusts, forming thrust faults, ridges, and cliff-like scarps visible across the surface. New measurement techniques using spacecraft data indicate that Mercury\u2019s radius has decreased by 2.7 to 5.6 kilometres, providing the most precise estimate to date. These groundbreaking findings offer crucial insights into Mercury\u2019s tectonic activity, internal dynamics, planetary contraction, and long-term geological evolution, enhancing our broader understanding of how small rocky planets form, stabilize, and change over billions of years.Understanding Mercury\u2019s shrinking radius: How the smallest planet in our solar system continues contractingRecent research shows that Mercury\u2019s radius has decreased by 2.7 to 5.6 kilometres. This is a refinement from earlier estimates of 1 to 7 kilometres, which had wide margins of error.The shrinkage is primarily due to cooling within Mercury\u2019s interior. As the planet loses heat over billions of years, the core contracts slightly. Since the crust sits on top of this cooling, shrinking core, it must also adjust, causing the surface to compress. This adjustment forms thrust faults\u2014areas where the crust is pushed together\u2014and produces steep, cliff-like features known as scarps, some stretching hundreds of kilometres long.Previously, scientists estimated shrinkage indirectly by measuring the size of these surface faults. However, because fault heights and lengths can vary and overlap, the earlier estimates were imprecise. The new research provides a more direct and accurate method of calculating how much Mercury has contracted.New method tracks Mercury\u2019s shrinking radius accuratelyPlanetary geologists Stephan R. Loveless and Christian Klimczak introduced a novel approach to measure Mercury\u2019s shrinkage. Instead of averaging all faults, they focused on the largest, most representative faults from three extensive datasets. These datasets ranged from 100 faults to nearly 6,000 faults, covering the planet\u2019s surface comprehensively.All datasets consistently indicated that 2 to 3.5 kilometres of contraction occurred due to faulting alone. When additional cooling processes of Mercury\u2019s mantle and core are considered, the total contraction reaches 5.6 kilometres. This method reduces uncertainty and provides a clearer, more precise understanding of Mercury\u2019s geological history.Why Mercury shrinks faster than other planetsMercury\u2019s iron-rich core loses heat more quickly than Earth\u2019s, which explains why the planet contracts faster. As the core cools and shrinks, the rigid outer crust is forced to adapt to the smaller volume beneath it. Over billions of years, this process has reduced Mercury\u2019s total diameter by approximately 11 kilometres since its formation.The contrast with Earth is significant. Earth retains more internal heat due to its larger size and tectonic activity, so its contraction is far slower. Mercury, being smaller and lacking active plate tectonics, shows the effects of core cooling much more visibly on its surface.Mercury\u2019s thrust faults and scarps reveal planetary contraction and coolingMercury\u2019s thrust faults and cliff-like scarps are direct evidence of planetary contraction. These formations occur where sections of the crust are pushed together, often producing dramatic features that rise several kilometres above surrounding terrain.By mapping and analyzing these structures, scientists can trace Mercury\u2019s contraction over time. The distribution and orientation of faults also reveal how the interior cooled unevenly, causing localized stress and deformation. These surface features act as a natural record of the planet\u2019s cooling history.Studying Mercury\u2019s contraction offers insights beyond just one planet. The methods used in this research could be applied to other rocky planets like Mars or exoplanets, helping scientists understand their tectonics, cooling rates, and geological evolution.Understanding Mercury also improves models of planetary formation and evolution. By observing how heat loss affects a planet\u2019s structure, researchers can better predict the long-term dynamics of terrestrial worlds, including those that could potentially support life.Also Read | NASA alert!

        "input": "A massive asteroid, 1997 QK1, is set to safely pass Earth on August 20, 2025, at a distance of 1.87 million miles. While not a threat, this flyby offers NASA and ISRO a valuable opportunity to study near-Earth objects. This event allows scientists to refine orbital models, assess asteroid composition, and improve planetary defense strategies.  Asteroids have long fascinated scientists and the public alike, serving as reminders of both the beauty and unpredictability of our universe. These rocky remnants from the solar system\u2019s formation often pass through Earth\u2019s neighborhood, sometimes sparking excitement and curiosity when they come unusually close. While most of these flybys are harmless, they provide valuable opportunities for researchers to study asteroid behavior, refine orbital models, and improve planetary defense systems. NASA, along with other global space agencies, closely monitors such events to ensure Earth\u2019s safety and to expand our understanding of near-Earth objects. One such asteroid making headlines now is 1997 QK1, a massive space rock expected to pass Earth on August 20, 2025, during a safe but significant flyby.NASA confirms asteroid 1997 QK1 will pass Earth on August 20: Size and distanceAsteroid 1997 QK1 was first detected in the late 1990s and has been tracked ever since. It belongs to the Aten group of near-Earth asteroids, named after the Egyptian sun god Aten. These asteroids are unique because their orbits cross Earth\u2019s path around the Sun, making them frequent candidates for close encounters. This asteroid\u2019s large size makes it particularly notable. To put its dimensions into perspective:It is longer than three football fields lined up. If it ever struck Earth, it could cause regional devastation, though not global extinction like the asteroid linked to the dinosaurs\u2019 demise.Fortunately, its trajectory ensures it will remain safely distant during this flyby.On August 20, the asteroid will pass within 1.87 million miles (3 million kilometers) of Earth. While this may sound vast, in astronomical terms it qualifies as a close approach. For comparison:The Moon orbits Earth at about 238,855 miles (384,400 km).This asteroid will pass roughly eight times farther than the Moon\u2019s distance.Though distant in human terms, space agencies classify such encounters as significant because they allow researchers to refine orbital predictions and study asteroid behavior more closely.Why Asteroid 1997 QK1 is not a threatAsteroids are classified as Potentially Hazardous Objects (PHOs) if they meet two conditions:They are larger than 140 meters (460 feet).They come within 4.6 million miles (7.4 million km) of Earth.Asteroid 1997 QK1 meets both criteria, but \u201cpotentially hazardous\u201d does not mean \u201cimminently dangerous.\u201d Instead, it signals that its path deserves careful tracking and monitoring by astronomers worldwide. NASA\u2019s precise calculations confirm that this flyby is safe, with no risk of impact now or in the near future, and continuous observations ensure early warning of any unexpected trajectory changes.Why NASA and global space agencies track asteroidsAsteroid monitoring is a cornerstone of planetary defense. Even small changes in an asteroid\u2019s orbit\u2014caused by gravitational nudges from planets or effects like the Yarkovsky effect (when sunlight heats one side of an asteroid, slowly altering its trajectory)\u2014can shift its long-term path.By observing asteroids like 1997 QK1, scientists aim to:Improve orbital models to predict future movements.Assess their composition, density, and spin rate.Explore strategies for deflection missions if a dangerous asteroid is discovered in the future.Notably, NASA\u2019s DART mission (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) in 2022 demonstrated the possibility of altering an asteroid\u2019s orbit by deliberately crashing a spacecraft into it\u2014an important milestone in planetary defense.India\u2019s ISRO plans future missions to study near-Earth asteroidsThe interest in asteroids is not limited to NASA. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has outlined plans for participation in global asteroid studies. According to ISRO Chairman S. Somanath, future missions may include research on larger near-Earth objects, especially as the world prepares for the highly anticipated close approach of asteroid Apophis in 2029.International collaborations involving NASA, ESA (European Space Agency), and JAXA (Japan) are essential, as planetary defense requires shared data and joint strategies.

        "input": "Scientists have achieved a significant breakthrough in decoding inner speech, offering hope for individuals with speech impairments. Researchers successfully translated imagined words into text using brain implants and AI. The study, part of the BrainGate2 trial, demonstrated that brain signals for imagined speech are similar to those for attempted speech.  For decades, neuro-engineers have dreamed of helping people who have been cut off from the world of language. A disease like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, weakens the muscles in the airway. A stroke can kill neurons that normally relay commands for speaking. Perhaps, by implanting electrodes, scientists could record the brain's electric activity and translate that into spoken words.Now a team of researchers has made an important advance toward that goal. Previously they succeeded in decoding the signals produced when people tried to speak. In the new study, published Thursday in the journal Cell, their computer often made correct guesses when the subjects simply imagined saying words.Christian Herff, a neuroscientist at Maastricht University in the Netherlands who was not involved in the research, said the result went beyond the merely technological and shed light on the mystery of language. \"It's a fantastic advance,\" Herff said. The new study is the latest result in a long-running clinical trial, called BrainGate2, that has already seen some remarkable successes.One participant, Casey Harrell, now uses his brain-machine interface to hold conversations. In 2023, after ALS had made his voice unintelligible, Harrell agreed to have electrodes implanted in his brain. A computer recorded the electrical activity from the implants as Harrell attempted to say different words. Over time, with the help of AI, the computer predicted 6,000 words, with 97.5% accuracy.But successes like this raised a troubling question: Could a computer accidentally record more than patients actually wanted to say?Could it eavesdrop on their inner voice? \"We wanted to investigate if there was a risk of the system decoding words that weren't meant to be said aloud,\" said Erin Kunz, a neuroscientist at Stanford University and an author of the study. She and her colleagues also wondered if patients might actually prefer using inner speech.Kunz and her colleagues decided to investigate the mystery for themselves. The scientists gave participants seven different words, including \"kite\" and \"day,\" then compared the brain signals when participants attempted to say the words and when they only imagined saying them.As it turned out, imagining a word produced a pattern of activity similar to that of trying to say it, but the signal was weaker. The computer did a good job of predicting which of the seven words the participants were thinking. For Harrell, it didn't do much better than a random guess would have, but for another participant it picked the right word more than 70% of the time.The researchers put the computer through more training, this time specifically on inner speech. Its performance improved significantly, including on Harrell. Now when the participants imagined saying entire sentences, such as \"I don't know how long you've been here,\" the computer could accurately decode most of the words.Herff, who has done his own studies, was surprised that the experiment succeeded. Before, he would have said that inner speech is fundamentally different from the motor cortex signals that produce actual speech. \"But in this study, they show that, for some people, it isn't that different,\" he said.Kunz emphasized that the computer's current performance involving inner speech would not be good enough to let people hold conversations. \"The results are an initial proof of concept more than anything,\" she said. But she is optimistic that decoding inner speech could become the new standard for brain-computer interfaces. In recent trials, she and her colleagues have improved the computer's accuracy. \"We haven't hit the ceiling yet,\" she said. NYT",

This sighting is believed to be the first recorded appearance of this species in the district, sparking hope and excitement within the wildlife community.Historically, the chital roamed freely across the Aravalis, stretching from Gurgaon to the Delhi Ridge. However, the rapid urbanisation of the 1980s and 1990s \u2014 fuelled by mining, real estate expansion, and deforestation \u2014 fragmented their habitats, pushing them into core forest zones like the Asola-Bhatti wildlife sanctuary. A 2017 Wildlife Institute of India (WII) survey of Haryana's Aravalis reported a significant decline in wildlife population, including that of the spotted deer, due to habitat loss and fragmentation.According to officials, this is the first confirmed sighting of a spotted deer in the Aravalis in recent records. Vivek Saxena, principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife), said, \"We do not have data on the last sighting of chital in the Aravalis, but this sighting definitely shows that habitat improvements helped wildlife return to the region.\"You Can Also Check: Gurgaon AQI | Weather in Gurgaon | Bank Holidays in Gurgaon | Public Holidays in Gurgaon | Gold Rates Today in Gurgaon | Silver Rates Today in GurgaonThe sighting underscores the significance of green spaces at the urban fringe. Badkhal lake is situated at the edge of the Southern Aravali Ridge, which connects to the larger Delhi Ridge ecology and links with areas like the Asola-Bhatti sanctuary, an essential corridor for wildlife in this region.\"Wildlife, when given undisturbed green spaces, sometimes ventures back into areas we might consider too crowded. This visit could indicate that the wildlife corridor is active or that native habitat is gradually reclaiming ground. Either way, it serves as a subtle reminder of the broader environmental threads still weaving through our daily lives,\" said wildlife biologist Sumit Dookia.If sightings like this become more frequent, experts suggested it could be time to consider restoring or strengthening habitat links, including corridors between Asola and Sarika, where the spotted deer population is currently active.\"Seeing a spotted deer in Faridabad is a positive sign. It shows that even small patches of forest and wetlands can support wildlife if they are protected. What's crucial now is to ensure these green spaces remain connected so animals can move safely across the Aravalis,\" said wildlife expert Sunil Harsana.

Spain is struggling with numerous fires in the west of the country, which have claimed four lives. By far it is the most affected EU country by fires, with more than 400,000 hectares burnt, accounting for nearly 40 percent of the EU total. Portugal, which holds the EU record of 563,530 hectares burnt in 2017, is the second-most affected EU country. It has never had an area of this size (nearly 274,000 hectares) burnt as of August 21. Romania follows with 126,000 hectares while in France, 35,600 hectares of forest have been reduced to ashes, mostly in the Aude region, which was ravaged by a massive fire in early August. These calculations by EFFIS, a component of the European climate monitor Copernicus, only take into account fires that have burnt areas of at least 30 hectares.",

They said the changes, which are driven by climate change, could lead to \"catastrophic consequences for generations.\"The research was published in the journal Nature. It sought to describe the interlocking effects of global warming on the Antarctic, the frozen continent at the planet's South Pole.The \"overwhelming evidence of a regime shift in sea ice\" means that, on current trends, Antarctica could essentially become ice free in summer sooner than the Arctic, the study found.This will speed up warming in the region and beyond, and could push some marine species toward extinction.\"Antarctic sea ice may actually be one of those tipping points in the Earth's system,\" said the study's lead author Nerilie Abram, a former professor at the Australian National University (ANU) and now chief scientist at the Australian Antarctic Division.The study warns that curbing global carbon dioxide emissions would reduce the risk of major changes in the Antarctic but still may not prevent them.\"Once we start losing Antarctic sea ice, we set in train this self-perpetuating process,\" Abram said. \"Even if we stabilize the climate, we are committed to still losing Antarctic sea ice over many centuries to come.\"What did the study say?Researchers gathered data from observations, ice cores, and ship logbooks to chart long-term changes in the area of sea ice.A \"rapid and substantial slowdown\" of the currents has already begun.\"This would lead to widespread climate and ecosystem impacts,\" ranging from an intensification of global warming to a decrease in the ocean's capacity to absorb CO2, the study reported.Will it affect wildlife?Some 90% of the heat generated by manmade global warming is soaked up by oceans.Since 2014, sea ice has retreated on average 120 kilometers (75 miles) from the continent's shoreline. Loss of ice is harming wildlife, including emperor penguins, who breed on the ice, and krill, which feed below it.And warming waters will further reduce phytoplankton populations that draw down vast quantities of carbon from the atmosphere, the study reported.",

The deluge washed away roads, damaged homes, and disrupted train services on the Jammu-Pathankot line. Rescue operations are underway, with the Army, NDRF, and SDRF assisting victims.  NEW DELHI: A cloudburst in Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s Kathua district has left at least seven people dead and several others injured, triggering landslides, flash floods and large-scale disruption. The incident, which occurred late Saturday night in Jodh Ghati village, washed away roads, damaged homes, and forced authorities into urgent rescue and relief operations.Train services along the vital Jammu-Pathankot line have also been suspended as rising water levels crossed danger marks on a key railway bridge. Helicopter evacuations have been launched, while multiple agencies including the Army, NDRF, SDRF and police are on the ground to restore connectivity and assist victims.Here are the top developments:Death toll rises to seven in KathuaOfficials confirmed that seven people have died in two separate incidents of cloudburst and landslide in Kathua. Five casualties occurred in Jodh Ghati following flash floods triggered by the overnight downpour, while two more died after a landslide in Janglote.Jammu Divisional Commissioner Ramesh Kumar said, \u201cThere was heavy rain in Kathua since last night... Seven people have died due to the landslide. Rescue operations are ongoing... Those who died due to the landslide, their bodies have been retrieved.\u201d Rescue teams are still combing through debris and flood-hit areas amid fears of more missing persons. Helicopters were pressed into service due to washed-away roads and villages cut off from access.Train traffic disrupted on Jammu-Pathankot lineRail connectivity has been badly affected with the suspension of up-line train movement between Kathua and Budhi. Senior Divisional Commercial Manager, Jammu Railway Division, Uchit Singhal, said: \u201cDue to heavy rains, water is flowing above the danger level through bridge number 43 between Kathua-Budhi. In view of this, temporarily till the water level subsides, up-line movement has been suspended, and in the meantime, up trains are being moved via a temporary single line through the down line track.\u201d Villages cut off after flash floods and landslidesThe cloudburst snapped access to Jodh Ghati village, where floodwaters swept through homes and agricultural fields, leaving families stranded. Several connecting roads were washed away, and a bridge collapsed, worsening the situation. Deputy Commissioner Kathua Rajesh Sharma confirmed that rescue operations are underway and that stranded people are being shifted to safer areas. Local police reported that a station building in Kathua had also been damaged. Rescue operations led by Army and NDRFThe Indian Army, NDRF, SDRF, police and BRO have been deployed in full strength across Kathua. Heavy machinery has been brought in to fragment massive boulders that rolled down into residential areas. Inspector General of Police, Jammu Zone, Bhim Sen Tuti, said, \u201cBoulders had fallen here which needed to be fragmented... Heavy machinery has been called for that. With the help of BRO, they are being fragmented here. These boulders are being removed by using explosives wherever needed, and bodies have been recovered from beneath them.\u201dHelicopter evacuation for injured victimsUnion minister Jitendra Singh confirmed that helicopter services were arranged to shift injured people to nearby hospitals. In his social media post, Singh wrote, \u201cHelicopter services have been arranged for shifting the injured to appropriate hospitals. 6 injured have been airlifted for hospitalisation in Mamoon, Pathankot, which was found to be relatively nearer destination.\u201d DIG Police Shiv Kumar Sharma and his team are camping at the site and coordinating airlifts. Centre closely monitoring situation, says Amit ShahUnion home minister Amit Shah assured full support from the Central government. In a post on X, Shah wrote, \u201cSpoke with the Lieutenant Governor and Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir regarding the cloudburst in Kathua. Relief and rescue operations are being carried out by the local administration, and NDRF teams have also been rushed to the site. Assured every support from the Modi government. We stand firmly behind our sisters and brothers of J&K.\u201d LG Manoj Sinha calls tragedy 'mind-numbing'Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha expressed grief over the loss of lives. In his message on X, he wrote: \u201cDeeply anguished by the loss of lives in the devastating rain-triggered landslides in several areas of Kathua. The tragedy is mind-numbing. Briefed Hon\u2019ble Union Home Minister Sh. Amit Shah Ji on rescue and relief operations by the army, NDRF, SDRF, police & administration.\u201d CM Omar Abdullah announces ex-gratia reliefChief minister Omar Abdullah conveyed condolences and directed immediate assistance for affected families. A statement from his office said Rs 2 lakh would be given for each deceased, Rs 1 lakh for severely injured, and Rs 50,000 for those with minor injuries. Compensation has also been announced for damaged homes: Rs 1 lakh for fully damaged houses, Rs 50,000 for severely damaged houses, and Rs 25,000 for partially damaged houses. \u201cThe Chief Minister has directed the administration to carry out immediate relief, rescue and evacuation measures to ensure the safety and support of affected families,\u201d the statement said.Repeated cloudburst disasters in J&KThe Kathua disaster comes just three days after a cloudburst in Kishtwar\u2019s Chisoti village killed 60 people and injured over 100. Experts warn that frequent extreme weather in J&K is linked to changing rainfall patterns and climate pressures in the Himalayan region. Officials say the back-to-back incidents highlight the need for stronger disaster preparedness and better drainage infrastructure. While the state government has sought central assistance, locals in Kathua have urged long-term flood protection measures. This includes improved embankments, real-time weather alerts, and a review of building norms in vulnerable areas.Connectivity and services slowly being restoredAuthorities are now focused on restoring essential services, including power, water and road links. In Kishtwar, where floods occurred earlier, officials said blasting of boulders was undertaken to clear blocked roads. Rope bridges are being built to reconnect cut-off villages in Kathua. \u201cThe power supply and water supply have been restored. A bridge is being built here with the help of the Army... All the passengers stranded in Machail were safely evacuated yesterday,\u201d said Divisional Commissioner Ramesh Kumar.

        "input": "Wildfires continue to test firefighters and locals across Europe as droughts and heatwaves turn regions into tinderboxes. The data for 2025 alone is a sign of things to come. A cruel summer as record wildfires scorch Europe Wildfires continue to burn across the south of Europe amid record-breaking summer heatwaves in many fire-prone regions. In some places, these fires have been exacerbated by wet spring months, which have helped vegetation growth capable of catching alight with ease during a dry summer.Already, an area equivalent to 1.5 times the size of Luxembourg \u2014 roughly 438,568 hectares \u2014 has burned across Europe in 2025. That figure is almost three times the size of fire damaged caused up to the same point in 2024.It comes as some parts of southern Europe suffer through multiple 40-degree (104 Fahrenheit) days, and prolonged heatwaves lasting a fortnight.The current summer has been described as the worst for wildfires in two decades.Where are the fires burning? What is the situation right now?\"We're seeing extreme temperatures in large parts of Europe, records being broken of 40 degrees in many places,\" said Julie Berckmans, a climate scientist at the European Environmental Agency.\"Southern France, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Belgium, Netherlands, UK, are all hitting high temperatures [and] massive wildfires in Spain, Portugal, France, Greece, Turkey, Albania.\"In Spain, those fires have burned through an area the size of London already.Portugal is fighting its own fires, with around four thousand firefighters currently active across seven active sites. It has also been forced to request help from the European Union's firefighting forces.An even greater number of firefighters has been mobilized in Greece, which is battling 20 blazes during this peak fire season.Deaths have occurred in Spain, Portugal, Montenegro and Italy from fires and heat-related events this summer.It has been a severe fire seasonEurope uses data from its Copernicus satellite fleet to monitor fire activity, and collates the data via the European Forest Fires Information System (EFFIS).A substantial amount of fire damage in 2025 has already occured.More than 250,000 hectares more of land has burnt than the same time in 2024.There have more than 1,600 fires across Europe, compared to just under 1,100 last year.And new regions are also experiencing greater than usual fire activity.Spain, for instance, has seen twice as much of its territory burned-through compared to the 2006-2024 average. Romania has lost four times as much land to fires this year.Cyprus has been badly impacted. It could usually expect to see around 0.32% of its landmass burned each year. Already in 2025 it's 2.5% \u2014 nearly eight times more.But it's also the number of fires that is concerning. France has had nearly three times as many fires as average amid what has been the worst wildfire season for its southern regions in decades.More to come...The fallout of severe wildfires goes beyond land loss or human fatalities. Damage to ecosystems through vegetation loss, health impacts through smoke inhalation, and economic decline are all consequences of widespread fire events.\"It's about \u20ac2.5 billion [$2.9 billion] of damage lost every year in the EU,\" Berckmans told DW. \"45,000 people on average were displaced due to wildfires from 2008 to 2023.\"The European Environment Agency's first climate risk assessment, published in 2024, found that urgent action is required to address the critical risk wildfires will pose to populations and infastructure and biodiversity in southern Europe.\"Wildfires are an urgent risk to address,\" said Berckmans. \"It's also a major risk that needs more action now in the rest of Europe.\"As European fall approaches, the number of fires and the damage they cause should slow. However forecasting the length of fire danger season, and the behavior of fires themselves, is becoming more difficult.Climate change will not only generate warmer and drier conditions across southern Europe, it will also begin to change other dynamic factors.Faster and more volatile wind systems, for instance, will increase the challenge for fire management personnel to predict how blazes will behave. That puts the lives of emergency workers and civilians at greater risk.\"Picture a fire so fierce, so fast, and so unpredictable it seems alive, capable of reshaping the weather around it and leaping across kilometers in a heartbeat,\" said Antonio Lopez, an expert in wildfires at the University of Seville, Spain.",

        "input": "Marking Independence Day celebrations, the Prime Minister announced and hailed the achievement as a pivotal step towards an Atmanirbhar Bharat in the energy sector, underscoring the country's transformation from a fossil-fuel-dependent importer to a global clean energy leader.\"When the world today expresses concern over global warming, I wish to tell the world that Bharat has resolved to achieve 50 per cent clean energy by 2030. That was our target for 2030. Look at the capability of my countrymen, look at their determination to fulfil the resolve of making Bharat developed--we achieved the 50 per cent clean energy target in 2025 itself, five years ahead of schedule. This is because we are as sensitive towards the world as we are responsible towards nature,\" PM Modi said on the occasion of 79th Independence.At COP26 held in 2021, India committed to an ambitious five-part \"Panchamrit\" pledge.This included reaching 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity, generating half of all energy requirements from renewables, and reducing emissions by 1 billion tonnes by 2030. India also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent and achieve net-zero emissions by 2070.According to the latest government data, India added a record 29.52 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity in 2024-25, taking total installed renewable energy (RE) capacity to 234.24 GW (excluding nuclear), up from 198.75 GW last year.Solar energy leads the charge, with installed capacity skyrocketing from just 2.82 GW in 2014 to 116.24 GW today, now accounting for nearly half of India's total RE capacity.Wind power follows at 51.67 GW, while large and small hydro contribute 54.72 GW combined. Biopower has also grown to 11.59 GW over the past decade.India now ranks 4th globally in total RE capacity, 3rd in solar power, and 4th in wind energy, boasting the world's fastest-growing renewable program.The clean energy surge has been powered by a suite of ambitious government reforms and programs.The PM-Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana, with a Rs 75,021 crore outlay, aims to provide free solar electricity to one crore households.As of August 14, 2025, over 17.24 lakh households have benefitted, with subsidies worth Rs 9,841.77 crore released. The scheme also introduced Model Solar Villages to promote decentralised clean power at the grassroots level.In agriculture, the PM-KUSUM scheme has installed over 8.53 lakh solar pumps, replacing diesel-powered systems and cutting an estimated 6.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.Beyond solar, India is expanding in wind, hydro, bioenergy, green hydrogen, and nuclear power. Offshore wind projects, backed by a Rs 7,453 crore viability gap funding scheme, are set to add 1 GW capacity off Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.The National Green Hydrogen Mission, with a Rs 19,744 crore budget, targets 5 million metric tonnes (MMT) annual production by 2030, along with 125 GW of new RE, Rs 8 lakh crore in investments, and 6 lakh jobs. Hydrogen hubs have been identified in Kandla, Paradip, and Tuticorin.In the nuclear sector, operational capacity has grown from 4,780 MW in 2014 to 8,780 MW across 25 reactors, with a remarkable 87 per cent plant load factor in 2024-25. Ten new reactors are already functional, and capacity is set to increase tenfold by 2047.\"The result is a virtuous cycle: local manufacturing creates jobs and resilience, competitive tariffs make clean energy affordable, and inclusive programs bring every citizen into the transition. As we look ahead to 2030 and beyond, India is not just meeting global commitments -- it is setting a new template for how a nation can grow, decarbonise, and remain self-reliant. In the journey from energy dependence to energy leadership, the momentum is unmistakable, and the destination is clear: an Atmanirbhar Bharat, powered by its own clean, green energy,\" the government said today, in a factsheet.With five years gained on its clean energy target, India is now firmly on track to meet, and potentially exceed, its 500 GW non-fossil capacity goal by 2030, positioning itself as a decisive force in the global fight against climate change.

Notable successes include the reintroduction of black grouse to the North Yorkshire Moors, northern England, and the return of the large marsh grasshopper to the Norfolk Broads in east England after an 85-year absence. Despite the achievements, the chair of Natural England Tony Juniper warned more needed to be done. \"A rising number of nature recovery projects, both large and small, are making a huge difference up and down the country,\" he said in the press release.\"We know we can turn round species decline and improve ecosystems with the right targeted actions, the drive and the funding. But time is running out fast,\" he added.Juniper called for more projects, more volunteers and more investment, particularly from the private sector.",

While no major damage was reported in Taiwan, one person is missing on the east coast. In China, coastal provinces evacuated around 15,000 residents as the storm moved towards the Taiwan Strait, impacting flights and regions south of Taipei.  KAOHSIUNG: Thousands of people sheltered and fishermen secured their boats across storm-battered southern Taiwan on Wednesday as Typhoon Podul intensified on its approach to the island.The typhoon is packing wind speeds of 155 kilometres (96 miles) per hour at its centre and \"is strengthening\", Central Weather Administration (CWA) forecaster Lin Ting-yi told AFP.Podul is on track to hit lightly populated Taitung County at around noon (0400 GMT) before sweeping across the island and into the Taiwan Strait.\"We are worried about this typhoon,\" Kaohsiung fisherman Huang Wei told AFP as he used more ropes to tie down his boat and checked on other vessels.\"We had already made general typhoon preparations yesterday, but this morning I woke up and saw news reports that the typhoon has intensified to be as strong as the last, (Typhoon) Krathon,\" Huang said.\"Last time, the two boats behind us weren't tied properly and hit my boat.\"Krathon slammed into Kaohsiung in October, with wind gusts of 162kph. Podul has gusts of 191kph, Lin said. More than 5,500 people have been evacuated from their homes ahead of Podul, disaster officials said Wednesday, as the typhoon threatens to pound central and southern regions that are still recovering from storms last month.Mountainous areas of Kaohsiung City and neighbouring Pingtung County, as well as Hualien and Taitung counties, could see torrential rain, the CWA said.All domestic flights across the island of 23 million people have been cancelled, along with dozens of international journeys.Many ferry services have been suspended and businesses and schools across the south closed.Typhoon Danas, which hit Taiwan in early July, killed two people and injured hundreds as the storm dumped more than 500mm (about 20 inches) of rain across the south over a weekend.That was followed by torrential rain from July 28 to August 4, with some areas recording more than Taiwan's rainfall of 2.1 metres for 2024.The week of bad weather left five people dead, three missing, and 78 injured, a disaster official said previously.",

        "input": "Talks on forging a landmark treaty to combat the scourge of plastic pollution were stumbling Saturday, with progress slow and countries wildly at odds on how far the proposed agreement should go.The negotiations, which opened on Tuesday, have four working days left to strike a legally-binding instrument that would tackle the growing problem choking the environment.In a blunt mid-way assessment, talks chair Luis Vayas Valdivieso warned the 184 countries negotiating at the United Nations that they had to get shifting to get a deal.\"Progress made has not been sufficient,\" Vayas told delegates.\"A real push to achieve our common goal is needed,\" the Ecuadoran diplomat said, adding that Thursday was not a just deadline but \"a date by which we must deliver.\"Some articles still have unresolved issues and show little progress towards reaching a common understanding,\" Vayas lamented.The key fracture is between countries that want to focus on waste management and others who want a more ambitious treaty that also cuts production and eliminates use of the most toxic chemicals.And with the talks relying on finding consensus, it has become a game of brinkmanship.A diplomatic source told reporters that many informal meetings had been scrambled together for Sunday's day off to try and break the deadlock.\"If nothing changes, we won't get there,\" the source added.Battle of the bracketsCountries have reconvened in Geneva after the failure of the supposedly fifth and final round of negotiations in Busan, South Korea in 2024.After four days of talks, the draft text has ballooned from 22 to 35 pages -- with the number of brackets in the text going up near five-fold to almost 1,500 as countries insert a blizzard of conflicting wishes and ideas.The talks are mandated to look at the full life cycle of plastic, from production to pollution, but some countries are unhappy with such a wide scope.Kuwait spoke up for the so-called Like-Minded Group -- a nebulous cluster of mostly oil-producing nations which rejects production limits and wants to focus on treating waste.\"Let us agree on what we can agree. Consensus must be the basis of all our decisions,\" Kuwait insisted.Nudging in the same direction, Saudi Arabia, speaking for the Arab Group, said the responsible way ahead was to start considering what bits of the text \"may not make it to the final outcome due to irreconcilable divergence\".But given how little is truly agreed on, Uruguay warned that consensus \"cannot be used as a justification to not achieve our objectives\".Eirik Lindebjerg, global plastics adviser for the World Wide Fund for Nature, told AFP that the Like-Minded Group's proposal was \"another attempt to make it a waste management agreement\", and to stifle talks on reducing the amount of plastic in circulation.Path through the fogThe UN Environment Programme is hosting the talks and swiftly called a press conference after the stock-take session.UNEP executive director Inger Andersen said a deal was \"really within our grasp, even though today it might not look so\".\"Despite the fog of negotiations I'm really encouraged,\" she told reporters, insisting: \"There is a pathway to success.\"Vayas added: \"We need to accelerate. We need a better rhythm in this and we need to also work in such a way that it will be clear that we will deliver by the end.\"Afterwards, Bjorn Beeler, executive director at IPEN, a global network aimed at limiting toxic chemicals, told AFP: \"This whole process has not been able to take decisions and is still collecting ideas. We're sleepwalking towards a cliff and if we don't wake up, we're falling off.\"'Profits from poisoning'Plastic pollution is so ubiquitous that microplastics have been found on the highest mountain peaks, in the deepest ocean trench and scattered throughout almost every part of the human body.More than 400 million tonnes of plastic are produced globally each year, half of which is for single-use items.Plastic production is set to triple by 2060.Panama's negotiator Juan Monterrey Gomez took the floor to slam those countries wanting to stop the treaty from encompassing the entire life cycle of plastic.He said microplastics \"are in our blood, in our lungs and in the first cry of a new-born child. Our bodies are living proof of a system that profits from poisoning us\". \"We cannot recycle our way out of this crisis.\"",

        "input": "Tropical bird populations have plummeted not only due to deforestation but also extreme heat attributable to climate change, according to a study published on Monday in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. Intensifying temepratures caused a 25-38 percent reduction in tropical bird populations between 1950 and 2020, compared to a scenario without manmade global warming, scientists based in Europe and Australia reported. \"The findings are pretty stark,\" lead author Maximilian Kotz, a researcher at the National Supercomputing Centre in Barcelona and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), told AFP.Bird populations in the tropics now face 30 days of heat extremes per year compared to three per year in the mid-20th century, he noted. \"This has major consequences for how we think about biodiversity conservation,\" Kotz said by email. \"Protecting pristine habitats is crucial, but without dealing with climate change it won't be enough for birds.\"Nearly half of all bird species are found in biodiversity-rich tropical regions. These often colourful animals perform essential services for ecosystems, such as dispersing plant seeds. Invasive species another threatBut birds living in these regions may already be \"close to the limits\" of their tolerance to high temperatures, which can cause heatstroke (hyperthermia) or dehydration. The overview study does not provide figures for individual species, but earlier literature is rich with examples of the devastating impact of rising temperatures.One documented the heat-related decline of birds in Panama, including the king quetzal, the red-crested quetzal, the two-coloured kingfisher and the aurora trogon. Another study published in 2017 showed how some tropical hummingbirds are now forced to seek shade to regulate their temperature in extreme heat, cutting into the amount of time they can spend searching for life-sustaining nectar. Extreme heat waves, which are becoming more frequent, represent a far greater threat than increases in average temperatures or rainfall, another result of human-induced climate change. Up to now, it has been assumed that the decline in bird populations worldwide was due mainly to other well-identified factors, especially habitat loss, pesticide use, hunting, and invasive species, especially snakes that snack on bird eggs and mosquitos carrying avian malaria. But the new findings \"challenge the view that direct human pressures have so far been the dominant driver of impacts on bird populations compared to climate change in tropical regions,\" according to the authors. To reach this conclusion, they analysed observational data from more than 3,000 bird populations around the world and used statistical modelling to isolate the effects of extreme weather from other factors.The findings help complete the picture of tropical bird decline, noted Aimee Van Tatenhove, a post-doctoral fellow at Cornell University's Center for Avian Population Studies who was not involved in the study.\"Deforestation has an obvious impact -- trees are cut and habitat is destroyed,\" she told AFP. \"We need long-term datasets like the authors used to understand how extreme temperatures impact avian populations.\"\"This study is an important reminder that we need to continue examining different causes of population declines and apply those findings to conservation initiatives,\" she continued.",

Yes,\" said Environment Minister Nadjiba Djilali during the cleanup campaign, adding there were no records of the plant causing allergies.Researcher Bahbah said stopping its proliferation was \"unfortunately impossible at this stage\".She said the plant reproduces at a high rate, both sexually and asexually.The species can reproduce through fragmentation, meaning new individual algae can develop from fragmented pieces of other Rugulopteryx okamurae algae.The algae spread mainly by clinging to the hulls of boats, and the Mediterranean's moderate temperature favours the seaweed's fast reproduction.\"We are going to fight it,\" said Fella Zaboudj, a state engineer in marine sciences, adding that researchers were monitoring its spread, development and evolution.Zaboudj said research was also underway to determine whether the algae could be repurposed as fertiliser.",

Ireland's wind energy sector has long been touted as full of potential. AI image BANGOR: On Ireland's blustery western seaboard, researchers are gleefully flying giant kites, not for fun but in the hope of generating renewable electricity and sparking a \"revolution\" in wind energy.\"We use a kite to capture the wind and a generator at the bottom of it that captures the power,\" Padraic Doherty of Kitepower, the Dutch firm behind the venture, told AFP. At its test site in operation since September 2023 near the small town of Bangor Erris, the team transports the vast 60-square-metre (645,000-square-feet) kite from a hangar across the lunar-like bogland to a generator. The kite is then attached by a cable tether to the machine and acts like a \"yo-yo or fishing reel\", Doherty said.\"It gets cast out and flies up, the tether pulls it back in, over and over again, creating energy,\" he said, testing the kite's ropes and pulleys before a flight.The sparsely populated spot near the stormy Atlantic coast is the world's first designated airborne renewable energy test site. And although the idea is still small in scale, it could yet prove to be a mighty plan as Ireland seeks to cut its reliance on fossil fuels such as oil and gas.\"We are witnessing a revolution in wind energy,\" said Andrei Luca, operations head at Kitepower, a zero-emissions energy solutions spin-off from the Delft University of Technology.\"It took nearly 25 years for wind turbines to evolve from 30-kilowatt prototypes to megawatt scale, and decades to offshore wind farms we see today,\" he added.The system flies autonomously, driven by software developed at the university in the Netherlands, but Doherty acts as the kite's \"pilot\" on the ground, monitoring its flight path for efficiency. The kite flies up around 400 metres (1,300 feet) and reels in to about 190 metres, generating around 30 kilowatts for storage.The force spins \"like a dynamo on a bike\", Doherty said, adding that \"it generates up to two and a half tonnes of force through each turn\".The electricity is stored in batteries, similar to solar photovoltaic systems, with the kite currently able to fully charge a 336-kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery.\"That's a meaningful amount of energy, sufficient for powering a remote outpost, a small island, polar station, or even a construction site,\" Luca said.\"Add additional kites and we can power a bigger island.\"'Mobile, flexible'According to Doherty, a chief advantage of the kite system is its flexibility and swift start-up capability.\"We can set up in 24 hours and can bring it anywhere, it's super mobile, and doesn't need expensive, time- and energy-consuming turbine foundations to be built,\" he said. A kite system is \"way less invasive on the landscape (than wind turbines), produces clean energy and doesn't need a supply chain of fuel to keep running\", Luca added.During January's Storm Eowyn, which caused widespread and long-lasting power outages in Ireland, the system showed its value in Bangor Erris, according to Luca. \"Paired with a battery, it provided uninterrupted electricity before, during and after the storm,\" he said. Ireland's wind energy sector has long been touted as full of potential.But progress on large-scale delivery of onshore and offshore turbines has been held up by planning delays and electricity grid capacity constraints.The Irish government has set ambitious targets for offshore wind energy to deliver 20 gigawatts of energy by 2040 and at least 37 gigawatts by 2050.In 2024, Irish wind farms provided around a third of the country's electricity according to Wind Energy Ireland (WEI), a lobby group for the sector. This compares to the UK, where, according to trade association RenewableUK, wind energy from the country's combined wind farms first reached 20 gigawatts in November 2022.The ability of airborne wind energy (AWE) systems to harness high-altitude winds with relatively low infrastructure requirements \"makes them particularly suitable for remote, offshore or mobile applications,\" Mahdi Salari, an AWE researcher at University College Cork, told AFP.But he said Kitepower would face challenges on \"regulation, safety, and system reliability\". Such technology however could plug gaps in places where \"land availability, costs or logistical constraints hinder the deployment of traditional wind turbines\", Salari said.By the 2030s, he said: \"I expect AWE to contribute meaningfully to diversified, flexible and distributed renewable energy networks\".Discover stories of India\u2019s leading eco-innovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025",

More than 29,000 hectares (71,600 acres) have already been destroyed by fire since the beginning of the year, according to Portugal's Institute of Forests (ICNF).",

Mehar\u2019s custom-engineered drone reached this remarkable milestone in an astonishing 0.91 seconds, a feat that not only demonstrates his technical prowess but also sets a new benchmark in the rapidly evolving world of drone technology.Mehar\u2019s journey to this achievement has been anything but straightforward. His fascination with drones began in 8th grade, and this passion has only deepened over the years. With a keen interest in pushing technological boundaries, Mehar embarked on a months-long project to build a drone capable of unparalleled vertical acceleration.\u201cI\u2019ve always been fascinated by the idea of pushing the limits of what drones can do,\u201d Mehar explained. \u201cBut breaking a world record wasn\u2019t just about the end result; it was about the process. I wanted to prove that current technology could achieve something extraordinary, but the path to get there was filled with challenges.\u201dThe project required Mehar to design, test, and refine multiple drone prototypes. \u201cThere were moments when I felt like I was chasing an impossible dream,\u201d Mehar recalled. \u201cI went through countless designs, and many of them failed during testing. Some drones crashed so badly that I had no choice but to go back to the drawing board and start from scratch. Each crash was a setback, but it also sparked new ideas and innovations.\u201dUndeterred by the setbacks, Mehar poured his energy into creating a drone that was not only fast but also aerodynamically optimized. \u201cI spent countless hours on CAD software, meticulously designing and tweaking each component. The goal was to make the drone as streamlined as possible, which led me to shape it like a rocket. This design wasn\u2019t just about aesthetics; it was about reducing drag and maximizing speed.\u201dMehar\u2019s dedication to his craft paid off in spectacular fashion. \u201cEvery failure taught me something valuable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt forced me to think creatively and to consider every detail, from the materials used to the weight distribution of the drone. The process was grueling, but it was also incredibly rewarding to see my ideas take flight\u2014literally.\u201dThis record-breaking achievement is more than just a personal triumph for Mehar; it has significant implications for the future of drone technology. \u201cThe possibilities are endless,\u201d Mehar mused. \u201cHigh-speed vertical acceleration could revolutionize everything from emergency response to space exploration. This isn\u2019t just about setting a record; it\u2019s about opening doors to new innovations and applications.\u201dMehar\u2019s groundbreaking work has already begun to inspire others in the drone community and beyond. \u201cI hope this accomplishment encourages other young innovators to push their own boundaries,\u201d he said. \u201cTechnology is advancing rapidly, and there\u2019s so much potential waiting to be unlocked. I\u2019m excited to see where we can go from here.\u201dAs Mehar looks ahead, the sky is truly the limit. With his record-breaking drone, he has not only made history but also set the stage for future breakthroughs in drone technology. And for this young innovator, this is just the beginning of an exciting journey into the future of flight.Disclaimer: Content produced by Mediawire on Behalf of Shweta Singh",

National broadcaster Doordarshan has good news for Lord Ram Devotees. Doordarshan has announced that it will telecast live the morning prayers offered to the Ram Lalla idol at the Ram Temple in Ayodhya every day.Doordarshan has shared the same in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Doordarshan said that the morning aarti offered to Ram Lalla will be telecast live on DD National every morning from 6:30 am.The national broadcaster said that the decision to telecast the morning aarti live every day was taken with the aim of connecting devotees of Lord Ram, especially after the temple was inaugurated less than two months ago in a grand ceremony and everyone can't visit the temple in person. The Aarti will be telecast simultaneously on DD\u2019s YouTube channel also.Secondly, the decision was taken because the Trust doesn\u2019t have logistical arrangements as of now for a live broadcast. Therefore, DD will be posting a two-three-member crew on the temple premises for the coverage of the daily ritual.DD's announcement to telecast the Aarti live for 30 minutes every morning comes after getting the go-ahead from the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust for the same. Initially, DD will air the \u201cMangala aarti\u201d for a few months, and then, the Ram Temple Trust will take a call on how to take it forward.6 Aartis daily at the Ayodhya Ram templeThere are 6 aartis of Ram Lalla held daily in Ayodhya Ram temple. These include Mangala Aarti at 4:30 am, Shringaar Aarti at 6:30 am, Rajbhog Aarti at 12 noon, Utthapan Aarti at 2 pm, Sandhya Aarti at 7 pm, and Shayan Aarti at 10 pm.Giving directions to devotees for Aarti, the temple trust said, \"Entry for Mangala Aarti at 4 AM, Shringar Aarti at 6:15 AM, and Shayan Aarti at 10 PM is possible only with an entry pass. No entry passes required for other Aartis.\"Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust advisory to devoteesIn an advisory to devotees coming for darshan at the temple, the Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra said, \"Devotees can enter the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir for Darshan from 6:30 AM to 9:30 PM. The entire process from entry to exit after Darshan at the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir is extremely simple and convenient. Typically, devotees can have a smooth Darshan of Prabhu Shri Ram Lalla Sarkar within 60 to 75 minutes.\"The temple trust advised devotees to leave their mobile phones, footwear, purses and other personal items outside the Mandir premises for their convenience and to save time.It has also asked devotees not to bring flowers, garlands, Prasad to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

        "input": "Microsoft discontinues Surface Duo smartphones but files a patent for a new foldable device with a single hinge system called 'spine cover plate'. The design aims to eliminate the hinge crease and reduce the device's thickness while offering added benefits and durability. However, its practicality remains uncertain. Microsoft did not get the success it was anticipating with its Android-powered Surface Duo-series smartphones. The company has discontinued the lineup after the Duo 2. But, this does not mean the company has stopped trying. A new patent application filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29, reveals that the company is working on another foldable or dual-display mobile device.The patent application describes the company\u2019s take on the foldable smartphone concept with single hinge technology called \u201cspine cover plate\u201d.Next Microsoft smartphones could feature a Galaxy Z Fold-like designAccording to the patent application, the phone could feature a \u201cflexible display\u201d in a bookstyle design similar to Galaxy Z Fold decies. However, the entire focus is on the spine cover plate mechanism which is aimed at protecting the single-hinge system of the device by covering the structural element. The differentiating factor between the regular hinge and Microsoft\u2019s design is that the spine cover adjusts automatically during the opening and closing of the phone to prevent any unnecessary gaps around the hinge to protect it from dust as well as water. Currently, Samsung\u2019s design offers an IPX8 rating which makes their foldables water-resistant only.The patent further mentions that the new hinge mechanism could allow Microsoft to eliminate the hinge crease less visible than the current options available in the market. Moreover, Microsoft has also mentioned techniques that could allow them to reduce the overall thickness of the foldable smartphone by allowing the spine cover plate to move closer to the device\u2019s hinge when folded. \u201cBy retracting the spine cover plate toward the central spine as the first display-supporting frame and the second display-supporting frame are rotated into a face-to-face orientation, the width of the folded computing device is reduced, thereby enabling easier and more comfortable handling of the device, such as with one hand,\u201d Microsoft noted in the patent.Interesting idea, but practicality is a question markThe entire smartphone market is searching for a way to eliminate the foldable crease from their smartphones. Some brands have already implemented the water-drop folding mechanism to reduce it, but there\u2019s nothing like a crease-free foldable out there. Apart from that, the durability quotient of foldable is also important considering all the movable parts these phones have. That said, adding another layer or a movable part on top of the entire foldable mechanism does not appear like a wise move despite the added benefits and durability Microsoft has explained in the patent application.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Bobby Kotick, the former head of Activision Blizzard, is reportedly considering buying TikTok, as the app could be banned in the United States. The Wall Street Journal reports that Kotick has talked to ByteDance, the company that owns TikTok, about buying the app, which could cost hundreds of billions of dollars.This comes as US lawmakers introduce a new bill that would make ByteDance sell TikTok within six months or stop it from being available in US app stores.President Joe Biden has said he would approve the bill if it passes in Congress.The Wall Street Journal report adds that Kotick, the head of OpenAI, Sam Altman, discussed teaming up to buy TikTok at a dinner last week. Kotick's interest in TikTok follows a rough end to his 30 years leading Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft acquired last year. The company faced a lawsuit saying it allowed sexual harassment and discrimination under Kotick's leadership. The Wall Street Journal also said Kotick knew about bad behaviour and didn't tell the board everything. Kotick was accused of harassment, but Activision Blizzard said the report was \"misleading.\"Lawmakers are worried about data privacy and TikTok's ties to China. US President Biden, whose administration has banned the app already on state devices, has expressed his support for banning the app in the US. However, former President Donald Trump, who once wanted to ban TikTok, has changed his mind, saying a ban would help TikTok's rivals, like Facebook and YouTube. As the bill against TikTok gains support, the app has asked its American users to speak up for it, sending messages telling users to call their representatives. The bill, which passed a committee last week, is expected to be approved when the House votes on Wednesday.

We want to install up to 18 petaflop capacity,\" Rijiju told PTI in a video interview.He said that the French company ran into some financial trouble and wanted the government to make payment to its subsidiary.Minister says that the delay is causing him \"worry\"Rijiju said that the delay has caused him lots of worry as the company has overshot the timeline. \"But I think we will sort it out soon,\" he said, adding that the government wanted to be \"very correct in our position legally\".\"We are ready to release the money because we want the machine immediately. The only problem is the amount is not small. So if we pay now, if the company is bankrupt or something happens, who will bail out,\" the minister said.Rijiju further added that the government was taking some steps to speed up the delivery of the supercomputer but did not elaborate. \"But I hope the French government will also intervene because we have a good understanding and a very good relationship with the French government.\"Since it is a high-cost equipment, we want to ensure that the transaction happens duly and properly,\" he said.\"From outside, everything's ready. It is only the problem with the main company. They want us to pay their subsidiary. We will pay only to a company whom we have entered an MoU with,\" Rijiju said.The supercomputing system, based on Eviden's BullSequana XH2000, is said to have a combined power capacity of up to 21.3 petaflops.Supercomputer at IITMThe supercomputer at the Pune-based IITM will provide 13 petaflops of computing power for atmosphere and climate research. As per the PTI report, it will integrate 3,000 CPU nodes using AMD EPYC 7643 processors and 26 GPU nodes through NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. The system will benefit from the NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand networking platform with In-Network Computing, 3PB all flash and 29PB disk-based DDN EXAScaler ES400NVX2 storage and Micron high-technology memory.The existing computing facility at NCMRWF is 2.8 petaflops and at IITM is 4 petaflops, respectively.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

These institutions excel in research, clinical training, and innovation, offering unique opportunities in tech-driven healthcare, patient-centered care, and cutting-edge research. With strong residency placements and a commitment to diversity, these schools are attracting aspiring doctors nationwide.  When it comes to medical education in the United States, Ivy League names like Harvard, Yale, and Columbia often dominate the conversation. However, some of the most prestigious, innovative, and highly-ranked medical schools in the country exist outside this elite circle. For 2025, several institutions have emerged as global leaders in research, clinical training, and healthcare innovation\u2014shaping the future of medicine far beyond the Ivy League\u2019s borders.From Silicon Valley\u2019s tech-driven campuses to world-renowned clinical centers in the Midwest, these schools offer exceptional academic rigor, state-of-the-art facilities, and unmatched residency placement opportunities. Here are the top eight U.S. medical schools beyond the Ivy League for 2025\u2014and why they should be on every aspiring doctor\u2019s radar.Stanford University School of Medicine, CaliforniaLocated in the heart of Silicon Valley, Stanford University School of Medicine blends medicine with technology like no other.

        "input": "Bill Ackman supports Alpha School, which uses AI for personalized learning. Alpha replaces traditional lectures with two hours of AI tutoring. Students spend four hours on life skills. There is no homework. A new campus is opening in New York. Alpha aims to make its model accessible through charter schools. The model focuses on preparing children for the future. Billionaire Bill Ackman backs AI-powered Alpha School in the US For over two centuries, education has largely looked the same: a teacher at the front, students in rows, and a long school day packed with lectures, note-taking, and homework. Beyond replacing blackboards with whiteboards and integrating some technology, the structure of K\u201312 schooling hasn\u2019t fundamentally changed. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman believes that is about to shift\u2014and the catalyst is artificial intelligence.Ackman recently endorsed Alpha School in a post on X (formerly Twitter), calling it \u201cthe first truly breakthrough innovation in K\u201312 education that I have seen since the KIPP Academy.\u201d The Austin-based private school claims to have cracked the code for 21st-century learning with a bold promise: two hours of personalised digital tutoring per day instead of traditional classroom lectures, no homework, and four hours dedicated to leadership and life skills development.Inside Alpha\u2019s radical modelAlpha\u2019s school day flips the conventional approach on its head. Instead of spending six to eight hours moving from subject to subject in a classroom setting, students spend just two hours with an AI-powered personal tutor that adapts lessons to their pace, strengths, and weaknesses.The remaining four hours are dedicated to developing soft skills, like public speaking, critical thinking, collaboration, and emotional resilience\u2014areas traditional curricula often sideline. The school also offers parents real-time data on student progress, eliminating the guesswork around performance.In his X post, Ackman wrote, \u201c200 years ago K\u201312 ed was a teacher and a blackboard in front of 25-30 kids. Today, the only thing that has changed is that the blackboard may be a whiteboard. And meanwhile the world is in the midst of an AI revolution.\u201dCan two hours really replace eight?The most striking, and controversial, aspect of Alpha\u2019s model is the compressed academic schedule. The assumption is that AI-driven, highly personalised instruction can deliver the same or better outcomes in far less time.Research on adaptive learning systems suggests this might not be far-fetched. Studies show students using intelligent tutoring systems can achieve mastery more quickly than those in traditional classrooms. By focusing only on what each student needs, AI tutors eliminate the inefficiencies of one-size-fits-all teaching.Still, education is more than academics. Critics argue that reducing classroom hours risks diminishing opportunities for social interaction, peer learning, and teacher mentorship\u2014critical components of child development. Alpha attempts to address this through its life-skills programming, but whether that balance works remains to be seen.Homework is out, engagement is inAlpha has also abolished homework, believing that learning shouldn\u2019t consume family evenings. Instead, students are encouraged to pursue hobbies, sports, and family time after school. Advocates say this approach reduces stress and fosters intrinsic motivation, while skeptics worry it could leave students underprepared for rigorous higher education environments.Scaling the experimentFor now, Alpha operates as a private school, but expansion plans are underway. A new New York City campus opens this September, and the company has announced intentions to launch charter schools to make its model more widely accessible.If Alpha succeeds, it could force a fundamental rethink of schooling. If it fails, it might become another cautionary tale in the long history of education reform.The bigger question: Disruption or hype?Bill Ackman\u2019s endorsement has drawn attention to Alpha, but it also raises a broader question: Is this the beginning of a new era in education, or just a high-end experiment for tech-savvy families? As AI transforms industries worldwide, schools may be next in line for reinvention. For now, Alpha represents a daring attempt to answer an age-old question in a modern way: How do we prepare children for the future?Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future.

        "input": "Stanford University's psychology program, renowned globally, presents significant costs for undergraduates, reaching approximately $82,000-$85,000 annually, while Ph.D. students benefit from lower tuition and substantial financial aid like assistantships and stipends. Additional expenses, including health insurance and personal costs, should also be considered by prospective students to manage their finances effectively.  Stanford University, one of the world\u2019s most prestigious institutions, offers a top-ranked psychology program at both undergraduate and doctoral levels. However, studying here comes at a significant cost, and understanding the financial commitment is crucial for prospective students. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the expenses for the 2024\u20132025 academic year.Cost of undergraduate Psychology programStudents enrolling in a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology at Stanford face an annual tuition of USD 62,484. Tuition alone makes up the largest portion of the expense, but students must also account for living costs. The estimated living expenses, which include housing, meals, and personal expenditures, amount to around USD 19,922 per year. Additionally, there are other mandatory charges such as health insurance, books, and miscellaneous personal costs. These can add a few thousand dollars more annually.When combined, the overall annual cost for an undergraduate psychology student typically falls between USD 82,000 and USD 85,000 per year. This figure varies depending on individual lifestyle choices, accommodation type, and personal spending habits.Cost of Ph.D. in Psychology at StanfordFor those pursuing a Ph.D. in Psychology, tuition is comparatively lower than undergraduate fees. The annual tuition for a graduate student is USD 38,160. The program typically spans five years, making the total tuition approximately USD 190,800 if fully self-funded.However, most doctoral students at Stanford benefit from significant financial aid. The university offers assistantships, fellowships, and stipends that usually cover tuition and provide a living allowance. Without funding, the estimated yearly cost, including tuition, living expenses (USD 19,000\u2013USD 22,000), health insurance, and other fees, would range from USD 58,000 to USD 65,000 per year.What students should know about additional costsIn addition to tuition and housing, students should prepare for extra expenses such as health insurance (approximately USD 6,000\u2013USD 7,000 annually), textbooks, and personal costs, which can add another USD 3,000\u2013USD 5,000 per year. These numbers can vary based on course requirements and personal spending.Ph.D. students typically enjoy a better financial arrangement, as most receive tuition waivers and a stipend to cover living expenses in exchange for teaching or research responsibilities. This significantly reduces out-of-pocket costs for doctoral candidates.Final thoughtsStudying psychology at Stanford is a major investment, especially for international students. While undergraduate students largely bear the full cost, Ph.D. candidates often have access to substantial financial support that makes the program far more affordable. Prospective students should also explore Stanford\u2019s financial aid programs, assistantships, and external scholarships to ease the financial burden.Ready to navigate global policies?

        "input": "A federal court approved a settlement in Montana, enabling students with disabilities to remain in public education until age 22. This decision aligns Montana with the majority of U.S. states, offering extended access to tailored support and skill development. Students who graduated without a diploma in spring 2025 will have a re-enrollment opportunity.  In a landmark decision, a federal district court has approved a settlement allowing Montana students with disabilities to remain in public education until the age of 22. As reported by the Associated Press, the ruling is expected to transform access to education for students with individualised education programs (IEPs), aligning Montana with most US states.What the court decidedOn August 13, Disability Rights Montana and the state reached a settlement requiring the Montana Office of Public Instruction (OPI) to offer education services beyond age 18 for students with disabilities.The ruling, approved by US District Judge Dana Christensen, includes a special re-enrollment period for students who graduated without a diploma in spring 2025. Families will have 30 days after notification to opt in. Students currently in school who planned to graduate without a diploma at 18 can now continue their education until 22.\u201cThe OPI will continue working with local school districts to ensure that every student exits high school prepared to succeed,\u201d OPI spokesperson McKenna Gregg told Montana Free Press.How families can benefitExtra Years for Life Skills: Students will gain time to develop independent living, social, and vocational skills before transitioning to adulthood.Access to Special Education Services: Extended eligibility ensures that IEPs continue to provide tailored support through age 22.Opportunity for Re-enrollment: Students who missed out on a diploma earlier this year can return and complete their education.Why was this change necessary?Previously, Montana law limited public education to age 18 for students with disabilities. Advocates argued this deprived students of critical years needed for practical skill-building.A 2013 decision by the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Hawaii set a precedent, stating that students with disabilities are entitled to education until 22 if similar services are provided to others of that age group. Most states already follow this standard.Past legislative effortsThe issue had surfaced earlier during the 2021 Montana Legislature when Rep. Fred Anderson, R-Great Falls, introduced a bill aimed at funding education for students with IEPs aged 18\u201320. The proposal highlighted the need for extra time for these students to develop essential life skills, such as grocery shopping, appropriate public behavior, and independent living practices.Despite some support, the policy saw limited adoption across schools, which eventually led Disability Rights Montana to file a lawsuit earlier this year.What happens nextFamilies will receive notifications from OPI and have 30 days to respond for re-enrollment.Students currently enrolled who were planning to exit at 18 without a diploma can continue schooling until age 22.OPI will work with local districts to implement the settlement across Montana.This decision is widely seen as a major win for disability rights advocates and a step toward inclusive education across the state.With inputs from the Associated Press.Ready to navigate global policies?

        "input": "The US Department of Education is reinstating over 260 employees to its Office for Civil Rights after a court order. This reversal follows a staff reduction that hindered civil rights enforcement, including Title IX protections. The decision addresses concerns about students' access to justice and the backlog of discrimination cases accumulated during the shutdown.  After months of controversy and legal battles, the US Department of Education will reinstate more than 260 employees to its Office for Civil Rights (OCR), reversing a sweeping staff reduction that had left key civil rights enforcement functions on hold.The decision comes after a federal judge ordered the department to restore OCR operations, citing the harm caused to students who depend on these offices to resolve discrimination complaints. But what triggered this reversal after months of shutdown and $1 million-a-week in paid leave costs?The backstory: March layoffs and office closuresIn March 2025, the Education Department implemented a reduction in force (RIF) that impacted 1,300 employees across the agency. As part of these cuts, seven of OCR\u2019s 12 regional offices were shut down, significantly reducing the department\u2019s ability to enforce federal civil rights laws, including Title IX protections against gender discrimination and access for students with disabilities.The laid-off OCR staff were not working but remained on administrative leave, costing the department an estimated $1 million per week in salaries\u2014a fact that sparked public criticism and political scrutiny, as reported by K-12 Dive.The legal push: Why the court stepped InThe turning point came with the case Victim Rights Law Center v. U.S. Department of Education, filed in April 2025 by two students who claimed they had suffered severe harassment and discrimination in school. They argued that OCR\u2019s closure blocked their access to justice, preventing them from attending school safely.Judge Myong Joun agreed, ordering the department on June 18 to return OCR to \u201cthe status quo\u201d so it could carry out its statutory functions. The department\u2019s Aug. 19 court filing confirmed that OCR staff will return in phases every two weeks between Sept. 8 and Nov. 3.Why this matters for studentsOCR plays a critical role in investigating complaints of discrimination based on race, gender, disability, and other factors. Its downsizing sparked warnings from civil rights advocates and education policy experts that students\u2019 equal access to education was at risk. Delayed investigations meant some students faced ongoing harm without federal intervention.What\u2019s next?Employees will resume work in phases starting Sept. 8.OCR is expected to clear a backlog of discrimination cases accumulated during the shutdown.The broader legal fight over federal layoffs continues, with the Supreme Court allowing some departmental cuts while leaving OCR protections in place for now.The big questionThe reinstatement highlights a critical issue: Can cost-cutting justify dismantling agencies that protect student rights? For now, the courts have made it clear\u2014when it comes to safeguarding education equality, civil rights enforcement is not optional.(With inputs from K-12 Dive)Ready to navigate global policies?

        "input": "A federal judge has blocked key provisions of Mississippi\u2019s law restricting diversity, equity, and inclusion in public schools, citing constitutional concerns and threats to free expression. The injunction protects classroom discussions on race, gender identity, sexual orientation, and national origin while a broader legal challenge proceeds, highlighting tensions between academic freedom, state authority, and the evolving debate over DEI in education.  A federal judge has delivered a significant rebuke to Mississippi\u2019s controversial law curtailing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in public schools, citing constitutional concerns and the potential suppression of free expression. US District Judge Henry Wingate issued a preliminary injunction on Monday, granting temporary protection to educators, students, and academic staff while a broader legal battle proceeds. The ruling safeguards classroom discussions on sensitive topics, including race, gender identity, sexual orientation, and national origin, ensuring that academic inquiry and open dialogue are not unduly stifled by state mandates.The controversial lawMississippi\u2019s legislation, which took effect in April, sought to prohibit schools from endorsing \u201cdivisive concepts\u201d and dismantle DEI offices, programs, and training requirements. Schools failing to comply risked losing state funding. The injunction, however, does not affect sections of the law that forbid preferential treatment based on race or penalize refusal to adopt DEI principles.Constitutional concerns and academic freedomJudge Wingate characterized the law as \u201cunconstitutionally vague,\u201d warning that it threatens both free speech and academic inquiry. He also approved expanding the lawsuit into a class action, extending protections statewide. Educators testified that the law has left them uncertain about what can be safely taught. Divergent reactionsReactions to the ruling were sharply divided. Jarvis Dortch, executive director of the ACLU of Mississippi, hailed the decision as a victory for intellectual freedom, calling the law an attempt \u201cto stop proper classroom discourse\u201d as reported by CNBC News. State officials countered that public employees speak on behalf of the government, and that the legislation is aimed at institutional compliance rather than individual speech.Broader implicationsThe injunction highlights a nationwide debate on DEI, academic freedom, and the limits of state authority in education. While the ruling offers temporary relief, the ultimate impact of Mississippi\u2019s DEI law on classrooms and scholarly expression remains uncertain, leaving teachers and students navigating a landscape of legal and educational ambiguity.Ready to navigate global policies?

        "instruction": "Generate a Multiple Choice Question with answer on the below Education input context.",
        "input": "Amid tech sector layoffs and evolving hiring practices, the H-1B visa program faces increased scrutiny. Companies are subtly rerouting job postings, allegedly limiting opportunities for US workers. Simultaneously, policy tightening and political rhetoric fuel a backlash against high-skilled immigration, creating uncertainty for foreign professionals and reshaping the workforce.  In a season where silence speaks louder than policy, the fine print of job advertisements is drawing sharper lines than campaign rhetoric. A recent report has shed light on the changing contours of H-1B hiring in the US technology sector\u2014where compliance, optics, and intent now perform an uneasy dance.According to Newsweek, companies such as OpenAI and Instacart placed job advertisements in the San Francisco Chronicle and other outlets to meet the Department of Labor\u2019s requirement that green card\u2013sponsored positions be publicly listed. However, instead of directing applicants to general recruitment teams, the ads routed them to immigration or \u201cglobal mobility\u201d departments.US federal rules require such roles to be posted across multiple channels: Two major Sunday newspapers, state workforce agency websites, internal company portals, and a platform of the employer\u2019s choice. The report suggests that routing applications through immigration departments may limit visibility for US-born candidates, prompting scrutiny over whether the system is being fairly implemented.Layoffs and the fragility of the H-1B promiseThe H-1B visa system was once positioned as America\u2019s wager on meritocracy\u2014a tool to import global expertise into its innovation arteries. In practice, it has evolved into a pressure valve for a corporate sector addicted to cost arbitrage and cyclical churn. According to Crunchbase, over 95,000 US-based tech workers were laid off in 2024 alone, with another 4,500 roles eliminated in a single week of July 2025. This is no ordinary correction. It is a recalibration of labour itself\u2014away from scalable human capital toward AI-automated efficiencies. Salesforce has frozen software engineer hiring; others have simply offloaded at scale.Caught in this shift are Indian H-1B holders, who accounted for 72.6% of approved H-1B petitions in FY 2022, according to data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Many of these professionals are employed by top sponsoring firms such as Amazon, Infosys, TCS, and Cognizant\u2014companies that have been central players in the ongoing tech sector contraction. Bloomberg estimates that over 200,000 tech workers were laid off in the US between November 2022 and January 2023, with 30\u201340% of them believed to be Indian IT professionals. According to industry estimates, around 80,000 Indian nationals on H-1B and L-1 visas have lost their jobs since late 2022, many of whom face a 60-day grace period under US immigration rules to secure new sponsorship or leave the country.The new face of America\u2019s skilled immigration backlashThe employment crisis coincides with a sharp tightening of US visa policy. As reported by AP News, the Trump administration has launched a sweeping review of over 55 million valid visa holders, aiming to identify security risks, overstays, or other violations. The vetting process includes monitoring social media and, in some cases, requiring visa applicants to unlock electronic devices during interviews. Over 6,000 student visas have already been revoked, and some worker visa categories, such as those for commercial truck drivers, have been paused.Compounding the policy shift is a rise in political hostility towards high-skilled immigration. Former Trump strategist Steve Bannon has publicly called for a moratorium on all foreign student visas. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has gone further, explicitly demanding a ban on Indian H-1B visa holders, arguing they displace American graduates. What once existed on the political fringe is now influencing mainstream legislative rhetoric, with the H-1B and OPT pipelines becoming focal points in the broader immigration debate.A system mid-pivotThe convergence of corporate hiring practices, mass layoffs, administrative crackdowns, and political rhetoric signals a period of heightened scrutiny for visa-linked employment in the US While companies continue to sponsor H-1B workers, even amid domestic layoffs, debate continues over whether the system is serving its original intent\u2014or facilitating structural reshaping of the workforce.The immigration system was designed to be merit-driven, but merit, it seems, is no longer the only currency. In its place: risk optics, political resonance, and a narrowing bandwidth of institutional patience.And so, in the quiet rerouting of a job listing or the sudden freeze of a hiring pipeline, the larger signal emerges\u2014not in outrage or legality, but in the quiet erosion of certainty.Ready to navigate global policies?

        "input": "Bollywood stars are increasingly collaborating with South Indian filmmakers, driven by the success of pan-India films like 'Baahubali' and 'Jawan'. Actors like Hrithik Roshan, Shah Rukh Khan, and Aamir Khan are exploring partnerships with production houses and directors from the South to tap into a wider audience and leverage the scale and vision of Southern cinema. For decades, Indian cinema has thrived on the diversity of its regional industries,Bollywood in Mumbai, Tollywood in Hyderabad, Kollywood in Chennai, Sandalwood in Bengaluru, and Mollywood in Kerala. Each industry boasted its unique style, storytelling traditions, and audience appeal. But the post-Baahubali era has changed the rules of the game forever. The term \u201cpan-India\u201d is no longer a buzzword; it\u2019s a strategy. Today, the biggest names in Bollywood are consciously collaborating with the giants of South Indian cinema, signaling a historic synergy that could redefine the future of Indian filmmaking.There have been few examples wherein the collaboration has worked and in few it hasn\u2019t. Take Shah Rukh Khan teaming up with Tamil director Atlee known for his films with Thalapathy Vijay, together they created Jawan which went on to be one of the biggest hits of Hindi Cinema. In comparison, War 2 with Jr NTR, when it was announced everyone felt this film would define the concept of Pan-India as two superstars from different industries Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR coming together but the film missed the expectations by a mile. Akshay Kumar teaming up with Rajinikanth for 2.0 with Shankar was also one of the first Pan-India collaborations that set the box office on fire. One of the most intriguing developments in recent months is the news of Hrithik Roshan in talks with Hombale Films, the banner behind Kantara, KGF and Salaar. Hombale has already emerged as one of the most influential production houses in the country, credited with pushing Kannada cinema onto the global map. For Hrithik, having ruled Bollywood for over two decades, his possible association with Hombale reflects a deliberate move towards projects that combine scale, spectacle, and a nationwide audience.PollWhich aspect of South Indian films do you find most appealing?Scale & VisualsStorytelling & PerformancesMeanwhile, reports suggest that Shah Rukh Khan may collaborate with Mythri Movie Makers, the powerhouse behind hits like Pushpa: The Rise, Pushpa 2- The Rule and Jaat. SRK\u2019s Jawan with Atlee was already a landmark in the Bollywood-South collaboration narrative, and Mythri\u2019s track record with mass entertainers makes this potential alliance particularly exciting. It also highlights how SRK, post his 2023 renaissance with Pathaan and Jawan, is carefully curating projects that expand his appeal across regions.Not to be left behind, Aamir Khan has reportedly shaken hands with Lokesh Kanagaraj, the man behind Kaithi, Master,Vikram, Leo: Bloody Sweet and recently released Coolie. Known for his gritty storytelling and masterful use of the \u201cLokesh Cinematic Universe (LCU),\u201d Lokesh\u2019s pairing with Aamir for a superhero film could be a perfect blend of meticulous acting with high-octane filmmaking.But it\u2019s not just the \u201cKhans\u201d and Roshan. Several other Bollywood stars are now aligning themselves with South Indian giants.Emraan Hashmi, once Bollywood\u2019s poster boy for romance-thrillers, has found a fresh footing with South collaborations. He\u2019s part of two major projects Pawan Kalyan\u2019s OG and Adivi Sesh\u2019s G2. These films mark a significant career reinvention for Emraan, proving that Bollywood actors can tap into South Indian cinema\u2019s massive fan bases to widen their reach.Deepika Padukone, after her groundbreaking role in Jawan, is set to collaborate again with Atlee, this time alongside Allu Arjun. The project has already become one of the most anticipated announcements, given Allu Arjun\u2019s global fan base post-Pushpa.Kiara Advani is making her southern splash with Yash\u2019s upcoming Toxic. With Yash riding high on the unprecedented success of KGF, Toxic is being positioned as a potential game-changer, and Kiara\u2019s casting ensures a Bollywood connect for Hindi-speaking audiences.Bollywood stars who transitioned The current wave is not unprecedented. Several Bollywood stars had already paved the way for such transitions:Bobby Deol, riding high after Animal, has cemented his South presence with roles in Suriya\u2019s Kanguva and Pawan Kalyan\u2019sHari Hara Veera Mallu. Saif Ali Khan impressed audiences with his villainous turn in Jr NTR\u2019s Devara. His presence lent the film an extra edge while also opening doors for more nuanced Bollywood imports into Telugu cinema.Sanjay Dutt has been one of the busiest Bollywood actors in the South in recent years. From KGF: Chapter 2 to Leo, his rugged screen presence has found a natural fit in larger-than-life South narratives.Alia Bhatt, Ajay Devgn, Kangana Ranaut, Raveena Tandon and Shilpa Shetty too have made appearances in South ventures, though on a smaller scale, reaffirming that the exchange has been happening for decades, albeit with less spotlight.Why south mattersScale and Vision: South filmmakers are increasingly celebrated for their audacity in scale. Films like RRR, KGF, Pushpa, and Baahubali have set new benchmarks for storytelling combined with technical brilliance.Pan-India Market: With the rise of multiplexes and OTT, the regional divide is narrowing. Audiences across India no longer care about labels; they only care about content. By collaborating with South big wigs, Bollywood stars can guarantee wider acceptance across linguistic markets.Fresh Pairings: The allure of never-seen-before combinations is irresistible. Whether it\u2019s Deepika with Allu Arjun or Aamir with Lokesh Kanagaraj, these fresh pairings generate curiosity, fueling massive pre-release buzz.Box Office Muscle: Many South films have recently outperformed Bollywood blockbusters in North Indian markets. For instance, Baahubali 2, Pushpa 2, KGF 2 and RRR minted more than most Hindi films. Collaborating with South industries ensures Bollywood actors remain competitive in this new box office reality. \"Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie  and War 2.\"About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

While surpassing 'Saiyaara,' it lags behind 'Chhaava' in profitability due to its high budget.  Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR\u2019s high-octane spy thriller War 2 has officially wrapped up its extended first week, though the results haven\u2019t quite lived up to the enormous hype surrounding it. Directed by Ayan Mukerji, the YRF actioner has performed better than any other Bollywood film released in 2025 so far, except for \u2018Chhaava\u2019, which continues to dominate the box office. \u2018Saiyaara\u2019 had managed to make Rs 174 crore in a week\u2019s time but \u2018War 2\u2019 has crossed that. However, a film with newcomers making that number in week 1 is much more profitable when it comes to the return on investment, as compared to a biggie like \u2018War 2\u2019 where the budget is so high. War 2 Movie Review'War 2' review: Stylish spy thriller with Hrithik\u2013Jr NTR chemistry divides fans over story and VFX While the film benefited from a strategic early release ahead of Independence Day, giving it an extended 8-day weekend, the momentum seems to be wearing thin. Even with minimal competition from Saiyaara and Mahavatar Narsimha, the film saw another drop in numbers. While the box office numbers are not insignificant\u2014making War 2 only the second Bollywood release of 2025 to enter the \u20b9200 crore club in its opening week, the overall performance has left fans and industry insiders underwhelmed.PollDid you enjoy 'War 2' more than 'Chhaava'?Yes, definitely!No, I preferred 'Chhaava'. On Saturday, the film made Rs 33 crore of which the Hindi version made Rs 26 crore. There was a huge drop in the collections of the Telugu version of the film. While the Telugu version made Rs 22.75 crore on Day 1, the number dropped to Rs 12.5 crore on Day 2 and more down to 50 percent of that on day 3. On Sunday, the total collection of 'War 2' in all languages was Rs 31.3 crore which was a drop from the Saturday numbers. On Monday, it collected Rs 8.50 crore as a total in all languages. On Tuesday as well, it started on a slow note and made Rs 9 crore on Tuesday. This number on Tuesday, could be due to the discounted ticket rates in many theatres. On Wednesday, the movie was expected to cross Rs 200 crore but just missed it by a hair. It collected Rs 5.50 crore on day 7. On Thursday, which was day 8, the film saw further drop and made Rs 4.71 crore. With that, the first week total of the movie is Rs 203.96 crore.

Kashyap moved to the South, quit drinking, and started exercising. He found creative inspiration and began writing more. He felt avoided by Hindi filmmakers and questioned his time in Mumbai.  Anurag Kashyap has candidly spoken about why he chose to step away from Mumbai, revealing that the atmosphere of the Hindi film industry had left him drained, depressed, and disillusioned. The filmmaker said he grew weary of Bollywood\u2019s obsession with box office numbers and what he sees as a decline in the quality of films being made. After shifting base to the South, Kashyap shared that he quit drinking, began exercising, and has found himself writing more than ever.In a conversation on Sudhir Srinivasan\u2019s YouTube channel, Anurag admitted that he couldn\u2019t cope with the negativity surrounding him in Mumbai. He recalled how people around him began positioning themselves as \u2018saviours\u2019 for his career, and how industry peers distanced themselves, believing he was on a downward spiral. \u201cI went into a depression. I\u2019ve come out of it. I\u2019m enjoying myself now. One thing I did was, I stopped watching Hindi films. I started watching a lot of films from first-time filmmakers, I started watching a lot of Malayalam films,\u201d he said, adding that working on Rifle Club played a key role in reigniting his creative spark.Anurag Kashyap Exposes T-Series For Underpaying Iconic Film MusicAccording to him, Bollywood colleagues had started to avoid him altogether. \u201cHindi filmmakers have been avoiding me, because they think I\u2019m bad new, because they think I have no filter and I talk. They think that if they get associated with me, they might not get (to work with) some studio or somebody else will get upset. And I\u2019ve come to a place that I\u2019m inspired by, and people have so much love for me,\u201d he explained. The warmth he felt in the South, he added, made him question his years in Mumbai. \u201cWhy am I in a place where I\u2019m being told that people are talking about your alcoholism, people are talking about your depression, people are saying you\u2019re losing your way. They\u2019re trying to be my saviour and telling me what I must do to save me from myself,\u201d he said.On giving up alcohol, Anurag revealed it wasn\u2019t a forced decision. \u201cI don\u2019t have to deal with people. Automatically, I started exercising. Automatically, I started writing,\u201d he shared.Kashyap has previously criticized the Hindi film industry for being overly money-driven, and even said that actors he once collaborated with now ghost him. He also spoke about how his mental health suffered after Netflix shelved his dream project Maximum City, with several other completed films of his stuck in limbo.

        "input": "Rajinikanth's Coolie is a hit. The film earned Rs 229.73 crore domestically. Its Hindi version surpassed Robot's collection. Coolie's Hindi version earned Rs 26.02 crore in eight days. The film opened well and maintained momentum. Despite competition from War 2, Coolie performed strongly. Experts predict further growth in collections. Coolie is Rajinikanth's third biggest hit. Rajinikanth\u2019s latest outing Coolie is proving to be a true pan-India phenomenon. While the film has already stormed the South Indian markets and taken its overall domestic tally to a staggering Rs 229.73 crore, its Hindi version too has achieved a significant milestone. In just eight days, Coolie\u2019s Hindi version has collected Rs 26.02 crore nett , making it Rajinikanth\u2019s second biggest hit in Hindi by surpassing Shankar\u2019s Robot (2010), which had earned Rs 23.84 crore from its Hindi release.The numbers highlight how Rajinikanth\u2019s reach in the Hindi belt has grown stronger over the years. Coolie opened decently in Hindi withRs 4.5 crore on Day 1, and gained momentum over the weekend, mintingRs 6.25 crore on Day 2 and a solid Rs 4.25 crore on Day 3 and Rs 4.75 on day 4 . By its extended weekend the film had already clocked more than Rs 19 crore in Hindi. The weekdays saw a steady trend with collections of Rs 1.85 crore on Day 5,Rs 2 crore on Day 6 ,Rs 1.3 crore on Day 6, Rs 1.3 crore on Day 7 and Rs 1.12 on Day 8 as per early estimates by Sacnilk.\u2018Coolie\u2019 release sparks madness: Rajinikanth fans dance and flood theatres in Tamil NaduFor context, Rajinikanth\u2019s biggest-ever hit in Hindi remains 2.0 (2018), which collected over Rs 189 crore in its dubbed version thanks to its spectacular VFX and Akshay Kumar\u2019s presence in a villainous role. While Coolie is still far behind that benchmark, crossing Robot\u2019s lifetime Hindi total in just eight days is a clear indication of its strong reception.What adds weight to Coolie\u2019s success is the competition it has faced. The film released alongside Hrithik Roshan, Jr NTR and Kiara Advani\u2019s War 2, yet managed to hold its ground firmly in the North. While War 2 had an edge in terms of screen count in the Hindi-speaking markets, Coolie managed to carve out a solid audience for itself, especially in single screens and tier-2 cities.WithRs 229.73 crore overall, Coolie has already become Rajinikanth\u2019s third biggest hit of all time, standing only behind 2.0 and Jailer. Industry experts predict that the film has enough momentum to continue adding to its tally in the next week as well and could possibly hit the Rs 275 crore mark.For Rajinikanth, Coolie marks yet another affirmation of his enduring superstardom. Even at this stage of his career, the Thalaivar continues to break records, cross industries, and prove why his appeal remains unmatched.\"Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie  and War 2.\"About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

The Day 28 addition of Rs 1.13 crore proved to be the final nudge needed to leapfrog past two popular titles Raees, a Shah Rukh Khan starrer directed by Rahul Dholakia and backed by Farhan Ahktar and Ritesh Sidhwani and Tiger Shroff\u2019s action blockbuster Baaghi 2 backed by Sajid Nadiadwala and co-staring Disha Patani. .What makes this feat even more impressive is the context. Unlike Raees or Baaghi 2, which rode on established stars with significant urban pull, Mahavatar Narsimha carved its space largely on content and grassroots reception. Audiences across have embraced the film, and its mythological narrative has struck a chord with both older demographics and younger viewers seeking spectacle.At Rs 165.63 crore, Mahavatar Narsimha may be at number 57 on the all-time Hindi chart, but its trajectory suggests that the film could rise further in the rankings if it continues its steady run into the fifth weekend. The absence of major Hindi releases in the immediate frame also works in its favor.In the bigger picture, the film\u2019s success underlines two key trends at the box office. First, mythological dramas, when executed with scale and sincerity, have strong theatrical potential in Hindi markets. Second, content-driven films are increasingly capable of competing with big-banner commercial ventures, even when they lack the traditional \u201cstar vehicle\u201d formula.For now, Mahavatar Narsimha has earned its place in Hindi cinema\u2019s record books. From an underdog beginning to overtaking films fronted by Shah Rukh Khan and Tiger Shroff, its journey is a testament to the unpredictable, yet thrilling, nature of the Indian box office.\"Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie  and War 2.\"About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

        "input": "A hacking syndicate targeted South Korean elites, stealing over \u20b9235 crore by infiltrating telecom websites and exploiting personal data. BTS's Jungkook was a key target; hackers attempted to steal \u20b952 crore worth of HYBE stock after his military enlistment. Fortunately, BigHit Music intervened, preventing financial loss. Jungkook A notorious hacking syndicate orchestrated a bold scheme to rob financial assets from prominent South Koreans, striking at the heart of the nation's elite. Operating from overseas, the group infiltrated domestic telecom websites to harvest sensitive personal data, which they then weaponised to access bank accounts and cryptocurrency holdings. This calculated intrusion spanned from August 2023 to January 2024, resulting in staggering losses exceeding 38 billion KRW (Rs 235.6 crore), according to Yonhap News reports citing official figures from the Ministry of Justice. Among the high-profile victims were business tycoons, venture capitalists, and entertainment icons, with the hackers opening fake mobile accounts to siphon funds undetected. Jungkook's close call in the spotlight BTS sensation Jungkook, famed for tracks like 'Seven' and 'Standing Next to You', emerged as a key target in this cyber onslaught. Shortly after his military enlistment in January 2024, hackers exploited his identity to breach his securities account, attempting to steal 33,500 shares of HYBE stock valued at approximately 8.4 billion KRW (\u20b952.08 crore), as detailed in Yonhap News coverage. The perpetrators transferred the shares to unauthorised accounts and even sold 500 of them to a third party, aiming to cash in on the ill-got gains. Fortunately, swift intervention by his agency, BigHit Music, froze the transactions and initiated recovery efforts, averting any actual financial damage. Jungkook successfully reclaimed the sold shares through a civil lawsuit, with the Seoul Western District Court ruling in his favour earlier this year, highlighting the artist's resilience amid the chaos.Tense extradition and global pursuit The alleged mastermind, a 34-year-old Chinese national, faced a dramatic downfall after months of relentless international tracking. Captured in Thailand following a tip-off in April, he was extradited to South Korea on August 22, 2025, arriving at Incheon International Airport under heavy guard. This breakthrough stemmed from collaborative efforts involving the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, Interpol, and Thailand's authorities via the Southeast Asia Justice Network, as outlined in Yonhap News. The suspect, who assembled the hacking crew abroad, now awaits interrogation and potential arrest warrants as investigators dissect seized devices for more evidence.

        "input": "Hrithik Roshan's 'War 2' has earned \u20b9204.25 crore, becoming his fifth-biggest Hindi hit, surpassing 'Super 30'. Despite this milestone, the film's performance has received mixed reactions, falling short of expectations given its connection to the Spy Universe and the success of the original 'War'. 'Coolie' has shown stronger momentum, particularly in mass circuits. Hrithik Roshan\u2019s much-anticipated War 2 has crossed a key milestone at the box office, emerging as the actor\u2019s fifth biggest Hindi hit to date. The film has minted Rs 150 crore in its first eight days, and as of now, its overall collection stands at Rs 204.25 crore. With this, War 2 has overtaken Hrithik\u2019s 2019 hit Super 30, directed by Vikas Bahl, which had managed a lifetime total ofRs 147.39 crore.While this achievement strengthens Hrithik\u2019s standing as one of Bollywood\u2019s most bankable stars, the film\u2019s performance has sparked mixed reactions. In isolation, crossing theRs 200 crore mark within little over a week is no small feat given that the film is part of Spy Universe and a sequel to the blockbuster War led by Hrithik Roshan and Tiger Shroff, hence the numbers fall short of the hype.Hrithik Roshan calls Jr.\u202fNTR 'incredible' and his favorite co\u2011star for 'War\u202f2'Adding to its advantage, War 2 enjoyed a wider release in North India despite facing competition from Rajinikanth\u2019s Coolie, which has already amassed Rs 229.75 crore. The Hrithik-starrer may have secured more screens, but Coolie has clearly had the edge in terms of momentum and audience pull, particularly in mass circuits.Both the films lost steam once the weekend was over. PollWhich film do you think will deliver better action: War or War 2?WarWar 2For Hrithik Roshan, War 2 now sits at number five in his all-time highest-grossing films list. His top four remain unchanged:War \u2013Rs 303.34 croreKrrish 3 \u2013Rs 231.79 croreFighter \u2013Rs 212.79 croreBang Bang! \u2013Rs 174.51 croreWith War 2 clocking in at Rs 150 crore, it has comfortably pushed Super 30 out of the top five. Yet, comparisons with its predecessor underline the sense of underperformance. The original War was not only a record-shattering success but also cemented Hrithik and Tiger\u2019s action chemistry as a major box office force. The sequel, despite its scale and the promise of extending the Spy Universe, hasn\u2019t quite managed to recreate that euphoria.The coming weekend will be crucial. Historically, Hrithik\u2019s films tend to enjoy strong second-weekend jumps if word of mouth holds, and War 2 could benefit from it. A small spike is expected, but whether the film has enough legs to cross Fighter or even challenge Krrish 3 in the long run remains to be seen.\"Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie  and War 2.\"About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
