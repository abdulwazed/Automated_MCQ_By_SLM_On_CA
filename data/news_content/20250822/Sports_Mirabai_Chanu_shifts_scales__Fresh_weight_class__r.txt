Ahead of the Commonwealth Weightlifting Championship in Ahmedabad, which serves as a qualifier for next year’s Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, the star lifter from Manipur has undertaken a comprehensive overhaul of her training regimen. With renewed focus on diet, recovery and workload management, the 31-year-old is embracing a change prompted by an overhaul in international competition rules. In June, the International Weightlifting Federation revised its weight categories, scrapping the women’s 49kg division — a class in which Mirabai has competed for the past seven years, and in which she famously won silver at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. She also holds the clean and jerk world record in that category, lifting 119kg at the 2021 Asian Championship.

Now, Mirabai returns to the women’s 48kg category — a division where she first announced her arrival on the global stage by winning silver at the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games. In many ways, it’s a homecoming of sorts, but one that demands significant physical and strategic adaptation. “While it may seem like just a 1kg drop, it takes a serious toll on the body,” her long-time coach, Vijay Sharma, told TOI. “We had the option to move up to 53kg or come down to 48kg. We chose the latter as it better suits her natural weight.” Sharma and assistant coach-cum-dietician AP Datthan went back to the drawing board two months ago to completely rewire Mirabai’s training strategy, aiming to maximize her performance without risking injury. Rather than pushing her through heavy single-session lifts, her daily load — totaling around 12 to 14 tonnes — is now spread evenly throughout the day. “This method keeps each workout manageable and gives her body time to recover properly,” said Sharma. “Recovery is the key. Spreading the workload helps her adapt better, stay fresh and maintain strength,” he elaborated. Dathan has calibrated Mirabai’s diet, increasing her protein intake to aid muscle repair and prevent muscle loss, while reducing carbohydrates. “High-protein foods like lean meat, eggs, lentils and dairy feature prominently, with complex carbs like whole grains and vegetables,” Dathan said. Recovery strategies extend beyond training and nutrition. Mirabai now undergoes regular massages, ice baths and sauna treatment at least twice a week to reduce inflammation and ease muscle soreness, supported by a dedicated female masseuse. With her support team’s unwavering attention to detail, Mirabai is optimistic about her prospects in the new weight category. Following the Commonwealth Weightlifting Championship in Ahmedabad, she will gear up for the World Championships in October. While the Commonwealth Games remains vital to her plans, Mirabai is focused on the 2026 Asian Games in Japan — the only major multi-sport event where she is yet to win a medal. Injuries derailed her campaigns at both the 2018 and 2023 editions, making this event the elusive goal.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4. Watch Here!
