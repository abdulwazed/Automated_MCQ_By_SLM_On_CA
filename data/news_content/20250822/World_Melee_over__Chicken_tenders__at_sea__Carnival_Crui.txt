Videos circulating online show several passengers trading punches as security staff struggled to restore order. Witnesses said the melee began around 2 am on Monday on the ship Carnival Sunshine, just hours before the vessel was due to dock in Miami.Content creator Mike Terra filmed the brawl and posted the video on Instagram @mikeisterra. Captioning the clip, he wrote: “I always hear Carnival is ghetto/ratchet. I have been cruising for years, but this is my first time seeing some action on a ship.”"Over chicken tenders,” the video maker claimed, though the exact reason behind the fight remained unclear. However, the dispute quickly escalated, drawing in nearly two dozen people. The seven-day cruise had sailed from Miami last Thursday, stopping at two Bahamian ports before returning to Florida.
