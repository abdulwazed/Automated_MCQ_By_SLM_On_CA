Big relief for animal lovers! SC revises order, tells MCD to let off all stray dogs except the aggressive – Here’s what unfolded in 11 days

The Supreme Court has modified its order regarding stray dogs in Delhi and NCR, mandating their return to original areas post-sterilization and vaccination, excluding rabid or aggressive animals. This decision follows widespread protests against the initial directive to relocate all strays to shelters.

The Supreme Court has modified its order regarding stray dogs in Delhi and NCR, mandating their return to original areas post-sterilization and vaccination, excluding rabid or aggressive animals. This decision follows widespread protests against the initial directive to relocate all strays to shelters.  NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has modified its controversial August 11 order on the removal of stray dogs from Delhi and NCR, clarifying that the animals will be released back into the same areas after sterilisation and immunisation. Dogs infected with rabies or showing aggressive behaviour, however, will not be released and will instead be kept in shelters.The court also barred public feeding of dogs in random areas, instead directing the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) to create designated feeding spots in every ward. Adoption of dogs by animal lovers has also been opened through applications to the MCD.August 11 – The order that sparked the stormOn 11 August, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan ordered authorities in Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram and Faridabad to ensure all localities were made free of stray dogs. The judges ruled that captured animals should not be released back on the streets.The court insisted its directions were not “driven by momentary impulse” but after two decades of systematic failure to control the menace of stray dogs. It cited increasing rabies cases, particularly among children, and stressed that the issue struck “at the heart of public safety.”August 12 – Outrage spills onto the streetsJust a day later, protests erupted in Delhi against the order. At Connaught Place, animal lovers staged a demonstration with placards reading “Beware: Kaal Bhairav is watching” and “Stop relocation, we stand in solidarity against the SC verdict.”Clashes broke out with police, who detained about 15 activists. Many were seen in tears, calling the order “childish” and “unworkable.” Nikhil Mahesh of Umeed for Animals Foundation said, “You need an immense land bank… This will only increase panic between people and dogs.”Politicians also joined in. Rahul Gandhi called the directive “a step back from decades of humane, science-backed policy.” Maneka Gandhi described it as “impractical” and “financially unviable,” while Varun Gandhi called it “institutionalisation of cruelty.”Meanwhile, MCD vans were spotted picking up dogs, which officials claimed was part of Independence Day preparations, not related to the court order.August 13 – MCD begins implementationMayor Raja Iqbal Singh announced that 100 stray dogs had already been picked up since the order. The MCD converted 20 Animal Birth Control (ABC) centres into shelters and identified an 85-acre site in outer Delhi for future shelters.Singh said, “We had assured people that we will implement the order 100 per cent. We are getting a lot of calls from residents.” He clarified that aggressive, rabies-infected, or sick dogs would be picked up first.Twenty-five teams were deployed across the city, and a helpline was promised for residents to report stray dogs. Singh added: “This is a people’s government, and this is a priority for us.”Yet activists continued to criticise the move, warning that inadequate shelters would only worsen the problem and harm the animals.August 14 – New bench hears caseA new three-judge bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria took over the matter. The bench reserved its verdict on petitions challenging the earlier order.“The whole problem is because of inaction of the local authorities,” the bench said, accusing NGOs, the Animal Welfare Board and civic bodies of doing “nothing.” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta warned against ignoring the suffering of “a silent majority,” citing 37.15 lakh dog bites in 2024.Senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Singhvi sought a stay on the order, arguing there were no shelters to house such numbers. “The community feeds them. Now you say because the community is feeding them, take them out and put them in pounds or shelters. There are no shelters in place,” Sibal said.August 16 – Police scuffle with protestersTensions escalated when a protest near Lodhi Garden turned violent. A Station House Officer was assaulted, with video showing protesters running toward him as voices shouted “maaro maaro.” Police registered a case under Section 223 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).Another case was filed over a protest near Connaught Place’s Hanuman Temple. Officials said demonstrators had gathered without permission, defying prohibitory orders in force ahead of Independence Day.Police confirmed legal action would be taken against those found violating the law, underscoring the increasingly confrontational nature of the standoff.August 17 – Chennai joins the protestProtests spread to Chennai, where animal lovers staged demonstrations against the Supreme Court’s ruling. The rallies came soon after Delhi protests, with participants decrying the “inhuman” nature of the order.Police registered four FIRs against Delhi protesters from August 11–12 who had gathered without permission. Viral videos showed heated exchanges between demonstrators and officers, including one of a Station House Officer being manhandled.The Chennai demonstration marked the first sign that resistance to the ruling was spreading nationally, reinforcing activists’ claims that the order was “regressive” and out of step with India’s long-standing policy of sterilisation and release.August 18 – Siliguri joins inIn Siliguri, demonstrators denounced the ruling as “inhuman.” Activist Anisha Paul said, “Dogs are voiceless creatures… You can spare criminals, so why can’t you spare dogs? Shame on you.”Protesters carried placards demanding compassion for strays, echoing anger from previous days. Meanwhile, police confirmed that earlier Delhi protests had resulted in FIRs for unlawful assembly under Section 163 of BNSS.The demonstration in Siliguri underscored how smaller cities were also becoming centres of organised resistance, fuelled by social media mobilisation and solidarity with Delhi activists.August 19 – Capital erupts againMultiple protests were staged across Delhi, including Malviya Nagar, Dwarka, and Greater Noida. Placards read: “Rapists on bail and dogs in jail,” and “No dog, no vote.”Activist Shikha Singh claimed at least 10,000 shelters would be needed for Delhi’s estimated five lakh dogs, but “such facilities are practically non-existent.” Protesters accused authorities of conducting night raids to pick up dogs, forcing some to patrol neighbourhoods to protect them.Another activist, Mouni Jha, said: “We don’t want shelters for them. They are free to roam like all of us. Shelters mean permanent jail and death for them.”August 20 – Gangtok rally against ‘cruel blow’In Gangtok, hundreds joined a rally from Zero Point to MG Marg. Organiser Jigmee Ladakhi called the order “a cruel blow to the very essence of coexistence.”“If we remain silent today, tomorrow compassion will lose its place in society,” he said, urging justice and protection for community dogs.Slogans of “Voice for the Voiceless” and “We Want Justice” rang out as demonstrators insisted stray dogs were not a burden but protectors of neighbourhoods.August 21 – ‘Black Thursday’ at Jantar MantarAnimal rights activists in Delhi observed a “Black Thursday” at Jantar Mantar, dressed in black and carrying placards like “Vaccinate, sterilise, return not remove” and “Kindness is our strength.”Mukesh Kumar, a 90 per cent disabled activist, said he left home after two years to attend: “Instead of ensuring sterilisation, the government is relocating them.”Protesters pledged to carry out sterilisation drives themselves to create a rabies-free India. Organisers announced that the protest would continue for four days, climaxing in a larger gathering on Saturday.August 22 – Supreme Court modifies orderThe Supreme Court modified its order, directing that stray dogs be released back into their original areas after sterilisation and vaccination, except rabid or aggressive ones. The MCD must create designated feeding areas, while adoption applications can now be filed by animal lovers.Lawyer-petitioner Nanita Sharma hailed it as a “balanced order,” saying all pending matters across states will now be transferred to the apex court. “They have said that regular dogs should be sterilised and aggressive dogs should be put in pounds,” she explained.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
