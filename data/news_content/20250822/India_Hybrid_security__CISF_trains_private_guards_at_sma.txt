The two-week ‘port facility security course’, designed by CISF in consultation with the directorate general of shipping and other stakeholders, will equip private security personnel with essential knowledge of port operations, threat identification and emergency response. It will also focus on standardisation of port security protocols, compliance with international maritime codes across all the ports, legal frameworks and optimal use of technical gadgets.Renuka Chowdhury, Priyanka Chaturvedi Explode Over CISF Role Against Women MPs in Rajya SabhaDuring the pilot phase, 40 private security personnel from three major ports — JNPA Sheva, DPA Kandla and MPA Mumbai – will be trained at JNPA training facility, Mumbai and 26 private security personnel from four major ports—New Mangalore Port Authority (NMPA), Kamarajar Port Limited (KPL) Ennore, Chennai Port Authority (ChPA), and V O Chidambaranar Port Authority (VOCPA) Tuticorin— at the ChPA training centre, Chennai. CISF plans to extend the course to other ports across both coasts in the coming months.The training initiative comes amid heightened maritime security concerns in view of the prevailing geopolitical situation. A CISF spokesperson on Thursday said the ‘port facility security course’ represents a strategic step to build resilience against evolving threats, while bolstering India’s role in safeguarding maritime trade in the Indian Ocean region.To be delivered by instructors from CISF, customs, marine department, and port health organisation, the program combines classroom learning with hands-on drills, preparing participants to respond effectively to security incidents.During the inaugural session at ChPA, CISF Inspector-General S R Saravanan said that “focused training tailored to the complex environment of ports, will empower security personnel to perform their duties with confidence and professionalism, ultimately safeguarding critical infrastructure and trade.”About the AuthorBharti JainBharti Jain is senior editor with The Times of India, New Delhi.
