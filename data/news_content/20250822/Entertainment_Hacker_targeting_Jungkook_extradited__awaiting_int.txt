A hacking syndicate targeted South Korean elites, stealing over ₹235 crore by infiltrating telecom websites and exploiting personal data. BTS's Jungkook was a key target; hackers attempted to steal ₹52 crore worth of HYBE stock after his military enlistment. Fortunately, BigHit Music intervened, preventing financial loss. Jungkook A notorious hacking syndicate orchestrated a bold scheme to rob financial assets from prominent South Koreans, striking at the heart of the nation's elite. Operating from overseas, the group infiltrated domestic telecom websites to harvest sensitive personal data, which they then weaponised to access bank accounts and cryptocurrency holdings. This calculated intrusion spanned from August 2023 to January 2024, resulting in staggering losses exceeding 38 billion KRW (Rs 235.6 crore), according to Yonhap News reports citing official figures from the Ministry of Justice. Among the high-profile victims were business tycoons, venture capitalists, and entertainment icons, with the hackers opening fake mobile accounts to siphon funds undetected. Jungkook's close call in the spotlight BTS sensation Jungkook, famed for tracks like 'Seven' and 'Standing Next to You', emerged as a key target in this cyber onslaught. Shortly after his military enlistment in January 2024, hackers exploited his identity to breach his securities account, attempting to steal 33,500 shares of HYBE stock valued at approximately 8.4 billion KRW (₹52.08 crore), as detailed in Yonhap News coverage. The perpetrators transferred the shares to unauthorised accounts and even sold 500 of them to a third party, aiming to cash in on the ill-got gains. Fortunately, swift intervention by his agency, BigHit Music, froze the transactions and initiated recovery efforts, averting any actual financial damage. Jungkook successfully reclaimed the sold shares through a civil lawsuit, with the Seoul Western District Court ruling in his favour earlier this year, highlighting the artist's resilience amid the chaos.Tense extradition and global pursuit The alleged mastermind, a 34-year-old Chinese national, faced a dramatic downfall after months of relentless international tracking. Captured in Thailand following a tip-off in April, he was extradited to South Korea on August 22, 2025, arriving at Incheon International Airport under heavy guard. This breakthrough stemmed from collaborative efforts involving the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, Interpol, and Thailand's authorities via the Southeast Asia Justice Network, as outlined in Yonhap News. The suspect, who assembled the hacking crew abroad, now awaits interrogation and potential arrest warrants as investigators dissect seized devices for more evidence. This case underscores the power of cross-border alliances in dismantling cyber networks that prey on vulnerable high-net-worth individuals."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie  and War 2."About the AuthorKorean DeskKorean Desk covers news and stories from South Korea’s entertainment scene.
