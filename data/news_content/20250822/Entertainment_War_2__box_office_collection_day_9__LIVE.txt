‘War 2’ box office collection day 9 (LIVE)

Despite high expectations, 'War 2,' starring Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR, has underperformed, earning ₹203.96 crore in its extended first week. While surpassing 'Saiyaara,' it lags behind 'Chhaava' in profitability due to its high budget.

Despite high expectations, 'War 2,' starring Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR, has underperformed, earning ₹203.96 crore in its extended first week. While surpassing 'Saiyaara,' it lags behind 'Chhaava' in profitability due to its high budget.  Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR’s high-octane spy thriller War 2 has officially wrapped up its extended first week, though the results haven’t quite lived up to the enormous hype surrounding it. Directed by Ayan Mukerji, the YRF actioner has performed better than any other Bollywood film released in 2025 so far, except for ‘Chhaava’, which continues to dominate the box office. ‘Saiyaara’ had managed to make Rs 174 crore in a week’s time but ‘War 2’ has crossed that. However, a film with newcomers making that number in week 1 is much more profitable when it comes to the return on investment, as compared to a biggie like ‘War 2’ where the budget is so high. War 2 Movie Review'War 2' review: Stylish spy thriller with Hrithik–Jr NTR chemistry divides fans over story and VFX While the film benefited from a strategic early release ahead of Independence Day, giving it an extended 8-day weekend, the momentum seems to be wearing thin. Even with minimal competition from Saiyaara and Mahavatar Narsimha, the film saw another drop in numbers. While the box office numbers are not insignificant—making War 2 only the second Bollywood release of 2025 to enter the ₹200 crore club in its opening week, the overall performance has left fans and industry insiders underwhelmed.PollDid you enjoy 'War 2' more than 'Chhaava'?Yes, definitely!No, I preferred 'Chhaava'. On Saturday, the film made Rs 33 crore of which the Hindi version made Rs 26 crore. There was a huge drop in the collections of the Telugu version of the film. While the Telugu version made Rs 22.75 crore on Day 1, the number dropped to Rs 12.5 crore on Day 2 and more down to 50 percent of that on day 3. On Sunday, the total collection of 'War 2' in all languages was Rs 31.3 crore which was a drop from the Saturday numbers. On Monday, it collected Rs 8.50 crore as a total in all languages. On Tuesday as well, it started on a slow note and made Rs 9 crore on Tuesday. This number on Tuesday, could be due to the discounted ticket rates in many theatres. On Wednesday, the movie was expected to cross Rs 200 crore but just missed it by a hair. It collected Rs 5.50 crore on day 7. On Thursday, which was day 8, the film saw further drop and made Rs 4.71 crore. With that, the first week total of the movie is Rs 203.96 crore. Now on Friday, day 9, till afternoon, the collection was around Rs 1.49 crore. Thus, the total at the domestic box office now stands at Rs 204.47 crore.
