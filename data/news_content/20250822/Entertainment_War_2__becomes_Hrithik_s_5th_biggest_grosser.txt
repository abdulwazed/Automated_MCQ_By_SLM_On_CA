‘War 2’ becomes Hrithik's 5th biggest grosser

Hrithik Roshan's 'War 2' has earned ₹204.25 crore, becoming his fifth-biggest Hindi hit, surpassing 'Super 30'. Despite this milestone, the film's performance has received mixed reactions, falling short of expectations given its connection to the Spy Universe and the success of the original 'War'. 'Coolie' has shown stronger momentum, particularly in mass circuits.

Hrithik Roshan's 'War 2' has earned ₹204.25 crore, becoming his fifth-biggest Hindi hit, surpassing 'Super 30'. Despite this milestone, the film's performance has received mixed reactions, falling short of expectations given its connection to the Spy Universe and the success of the original 'War'. 'Coolie' has shown stronger momentum, particularly in mass circuits. Hrithik Roshan’s much-anticipated War 2 has crossed a key milestone at the box office, emerging as the actor’s fifth biggest Hindi hit to date. The film has minted Rs 150 crore in its first eight days, and as of now, its overall collection stands at Rs 204.25 crore. With this, War 2 has overtaken Hrithik’s 2019 hit Super 30, directed by Vikas Bahl, which had managed a lifetime total ofRs 147.39 crore.While this achievement strengthens Hrithik’s standing as one of Bollywood’s most bankable stars, the film’s performance has sparked mixed reactions. In isolation, crossing theRs 200 crore mark within little over a week is no small feat given that the film is part of Spy Universe and a sequel to the blockbuster War led by Hrithik Roshan and Tiger Shroff, hence the numbers fall short of the hype.Hrithik Roshan calls Jr. NTR 'incredible' and his favorite co‑star for 'War 2'Adding to its advantage, War 2 enjoyed a wider release in North India despite facing competition from Rajinikanth’s Coolie, which has already amassed Rs 229.75 crore. The Hrithik-starrer may have secured more screens, but Coolie has clearly had the edge in terms of momentum and audience pull, particularly in mass circuits.Both the films lost steam once the weekend was over. PollWhich film do you think will deliver better action: War or War 2?WarWar 2For Hrithik Roshan, War 2 now sits at number five in his all-time highest-grossing films list. His top four remain unchanged:War –Rs 303.34 croreKrrish 3 –Rs 231.79 croreFighter –Rs 212.79 croreBang Bang! –Rs 174.51 croreWith War 2 clocking in at Rs 150 crore, it has comfortably pushed Super 30 out of the top five. Yet, comparisons with its predecessor underline the sense of underperformance. The original War was not only a record-shattering success but also cemented Hrithik and Tiger’s action chemistry as a major box office force. The sequel, despite its scale and the promise of extending the Spy Universe, hasn’t quite managed to recreate that euphoria.The coming weekend will be crucial. Historically, Hrithik’s films tend to enjoy strong second-weekend jumps if word of mouth holds, and War 2 could benefit from it. A small spike is expected, but whether the film has enough legs to cross Fighter or even challenge Krrish 3 in the long run remains to be seen."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie  and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
