Federal court rules Montana students with disabilities can stay in school until age 22: How families can benefit

A federal court approved a settlement in Montana, enabling students with disabilities to remain in public education until age 22. This decision aligns Montana with the majority of U.S. states, offering extended access to tailored support and skill development. Students who graduated without a diploma in spring 2025 will have a re-enrollment opportunity.

A federal court approved a settlement in Montana, enabling students with disabilities to remain in public education until age 22. This decision aligns Montana with the majority of U.S. states, offering extended access to tailored support and skill development. Students who graduated without a diploma in spring 2025 will have a re-enrollment opportunity.  In a landmark decision, a federal district court has approved a settlement allowing Montana students with disabilities to remain in public education until the age of 22. As reported by the Associated Press, the ruling is expected to transform access to education for students with individualised education programs (IEPs), aligning Montana with most US states.What the court decidedOn August 13, Disability Rights Montana and the state reached a settlement requiring the Montana Office of Public Instruction (OPI) to offer education services beyond age 18 for students with disabilities.The ruling, approved by US District Judge Dana Christensen, includes a special re-enrollment period for students who graduated without a diploma in spring 2025. Families will have 30 days after notification to opt in. Students currently in school who planned to graduate without a diploma at 18 can now continue their education until 22.“The OPI will continue working with local school districts to ensure that every student exits high school prepared to succeed,” OPI spokesperson McKenna Gregg told Montana Free Press.How families can benefitExtra Years for Life Skills: Students will gain time to develop independent living, social, and vocational skills before transitioning to adulthood.Access to Special Education Services: Extended eligibility ensures that IEPs continue to provide tailored support through age 22.Opportunity for Re-enrollment: Students who missed out on a diploma earlier this year can return and complete their education.Why was this change necessary?Previously, Montana law limited public education to age 18 for students with disabilities. Advocates argued this deprived students of critical years needed for practical skill-building.A 2013 decision by the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Hawaii set a precedent, stating that students with disabilities are entitled to education until 22 if similar services are provided to others of that age group. Most states already follow this standard.Past legislative effortsThe issue had surfaced earlier during the 2021 Montana Legislature when Rep. Fred Anderson, R-Great Falls, introduced a bill aimed at funding education for students with IEPs aged 18–20. The proposal highlighted the need for extra time for these students to develop essential life skills, such as grocery shopping, appropriate public behavior, and independent living practices.Despite some support, the policy saw limited adoption across schools, which eventually led Disability Rights Montana to file a lawsuit earlier this year.What happens nextFamilies will receive notifications from OPI and have 30 days to respond for re-enrollment.Students currently enrolled who were planning to exit at 18 without a diploma can continue schooling until age 22.OPI will work with local districts to implement the settlement across Montana.This decision is widely seen as a major win for disability rights advocates and a step toward inclusive education across the state.With inputs from the Associated Press.Ready to navigate global policies?
