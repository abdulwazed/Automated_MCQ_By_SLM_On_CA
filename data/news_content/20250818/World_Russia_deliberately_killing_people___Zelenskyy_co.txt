They are aware that a meeting is taking place today in Washington that will address the end of the war,” Zelenskyy wrote on X. “The Russians are deliberately killing people, particularly children. Seven people have been killed as a result of the drone strike in Kharkiv, the youngest being a girl who is only a year and a half old. Dozens have been injured, including children.”Attacks across multiple regionsRussian strikes also targeted Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, the Sumy region, and Odesa, destroying residential buildings and critical infrastructure, as per the report by Reuters.In Zaporizhzhia, a Russian missile attack killed three people and wounded 20, with “many in critical condition,” according to regional governor Ivan Fedorov.Zelenskyy condemned a deliberate strike on an energy facility in Odesa belonging to Azerbaijan’s SOCAR company. “This implies that it was an attack not only on us but also on our relations and energy security,” he said.Diplomatic efforts and Washington talksZelenskyy is set to meet Trump in Washington to discuss key issues related to ending the conflict, alongside leaders from the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Finland, the EU, and Nato.“The Russian war machine continues to destroy lives despite everything. Putin will commit demonstrative killings to maintain pressure on Ukraine and Europe, as well as to humiliate diplomatic efforts,” Zelenskyy said. “That is precisely why we are seeking assistance to put an end to the killings. Reliable security guarantees are required. Russia should not be rewarded for its participation in this war. The war must be ended. And it is Moscow that must hear the word: ‘Stop.’”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
