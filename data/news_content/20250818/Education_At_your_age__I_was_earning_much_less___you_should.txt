While cultural influences play a role, experts stress that toxic management styles aren’t ethnic traits but universal flaws.  A Reddit post recently sparked attention when an employee recounted asking their Indian manager for a raise — only to be told, ‘At your age, I was earning much less — you should be happy with what you’re getting.’ The remark was far from a casual aside; it triggered a broader conversation about whether certain managerial practices of Indians in US workplaces could negatively affect employees.From terse interview exchanges to subtle, everyday biases, employees depicted managers whose conduct weighed heavily on overall workplace morale and engagement. “It’s honestly exhausting to deal with managers like this. Instead of building people up, they drag everyone down with their bitterness and toxic mindset,” the same user reflected.The discussion thread quickly swelled with narratives underscoring experiences of authority, personal insecurities, and generational conditioning. For many, it posed a pressing question: Are these behaviors isolated incidents, or do they indicate a recurring style that can leave employees drained?Not one manager, but many: Why toxic patterns keep repeating at workSeveral Reddit users recounted experiences hinting at systemic patterns rather than singular occurrences. One described an interview in which a manager dismissed their answer as “the worst I have ever heard” and asked them to reconsider it, only to subsequently extend a job offer.Another user highlighted a dissonance between seniority and compensation: “If you are older, he'll tell you — you are very senior — you are expected to perform at a senior level, while paying you a junior-level salary.”These testimonies suggest repeated behaviors that employees found frustrating and taxing, leaving a lasting impact on workplace dynamics and overall employee wellbeing. Yet, looking at these anecdotes as mere oddities would be a mistake. They map onto what one repeatedly hears in corporate hallways — a style of management that prizes control over collaboration, hierarchy over mentorship.Cultural and historical influences on managementSome linked these behaviors to cultural and historical influences. While the notion of a “scarcity mindset” has been discussed online, many emphasized that managerial conduct can be shaped by a complex blend of upbringing, competitive pressures, and hierarchical norms.One Reddit user wrote, “The roots of bad middle management are in the scarcity mindset that gets embedded in all Indians when you grow up in India. Makes you see the world as a zero-sum game — someone needs to lose in order for someone else to win.”This mindset emerges from growing up in environments where resources and opportunities were limited, and advancement often required outcompeting others. It can foster a heightened sense of risk aversion, a protective approach to personal gains, and a belief that for someone to succeed, another must lose — attitudes that, when carried into workplaces, can influence managerial decisions and employee interactions.Culture clash or common flaw? Why it’s not just about Indian managersAttributing this behaviour purely to cultural conditioning risks missing another point: Indian managers in multinational workplaces often straddle two worlds. On the one hand, they inherit habits of caution, deference to hierarchy, and scepticism born of scarcity. On the other, they face Western corporate cultures that reward openness, flat structures, and recognition. The friction between the two can produce managerial habits that appear abrasive, defensive, or excessively controlling to employees.Several Redditors cautioned against broad generalizations. “You are exhibiting the same mentality then. You are typecasting all Indians in the same bracket. And that’s wrong,” one remarked. Another added, “I’ve had managers considered as typical Americans make similar comments. This is not about race or ethnicity but about this manager. Stop stereotyping entire communities.”Insecure or dismissive managerial styles are not confined to any single culture. It is worth remembering that while some patterns may reflect cultural residue, others are universal human failings — insecurity, fear of being outshone, or reluctance to share credit. When those traits coincide with cultural baggage, the outcome feels amplified. That is why generalisations, tempting as they are, flatten nuance and unfairly paint every Indian manager with the same brush.The key lies in identifying patterns that may affect employee engagement and wellbeing without resorting to sweeping assumptions, while establishing frameworks that promote accountability, constructive feedback, and sustainable mentorship.Bottom line: Bad management isn’t an ethnic traitThese narratives, while anecdotal, illuminate the complexities of workplace dynamics under Indian managers in US offices. For employees, the stories underscore the importance of navigating managerial interactions with awareness while advocating for fairness, transparency, and support. For organizations, they highlight the need to foster leadership that balances experience with empathy, and authority with mentorship.If there is a lesson in these stories, it is this: Bad management is not an ethnic trait, but when cultural habits meet unchecked authority, the outcome can feel distinctly patterned. Recognising this — without caricaturing — is the first step toward healthier workplaces.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now. Follow us here.Ready to navigate global policies?
