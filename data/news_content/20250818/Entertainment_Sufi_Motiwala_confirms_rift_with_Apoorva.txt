Sufi revealed he cut ties because he felt Apoorva didn't address her fans' abuse towards him. He clarified he didn't use her for clout, wanting genuine friendship, not dealing with constant mistreatment without accountability.  With the way things unfolded during and after ‘The Traitors,’ it seemed like the entertainment industry was ready to find new BFFs in Sufi Motiwala and Arpoorva Mukhija. However, just when the audience was starting to cherish their bond, their friendship ended. Sufi Motiwala took to his social media handle to clear the air around their bond and say that he has cut ties with Apoorva. In his words, he wanted to be friends with Apoorva Mukhija and not Rebel Kid.Read on to know what Sufi Motiwala has to say on his broken bond with Apoorva MukhijaSufi Motiwala breaks his silence on his ‘not friends anymore’ status with Apoorva Mukhija“No more lies. I’ve received a lot of texts saying that I’ve taken clout from Apoorva, and I’ve left her. I’ve literally never collaborated on a reel with her and have been on her YouTube twice, both of which were her content pieces entirely," wrote Sufi before adding, “So no I’m not sorry I didn’t use her for clout (incase u forgot we were on the same show without knowing each other I don’t need her clout) I wanted to be friends with Apoorva not the rebel kid when there was no accountability constantly for how I was being treated I distanced myself."He shared that despite his request to Apoorva to make her fans understand not to slam him, he got no response from her. “I even requested her to ask her audience to calm down because they’ve been abusing me for no reason. Sadly, this person who called me her best friend has no concern for that, or the fact that maybe I’m hurt. THAT is why I’m not friends with her anymore. Keep it cute, keep it moving."“Idc about anything u think I’m a horrible person, ok. But I have worked my a** off to build myself to where I am, and I won’t let a bunch of children discredit that by spreading misinformation," he concluded.Sufi and Apoorva formed a strong friendship during the shoot of ‘The Traitors,’ which fans on the internet embraced. However, keen observers noted that the two have stopped mentioning each other on social media, despite attending the same events, including one in Australia. Reportedly, Sufi has unfollowed Apoorva on Instagram.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
