"He has been prevented from speaking to the people or expressing his views after Rahul and opposition attacked him in the vote rigging case. Perhaps he is not even being kept in Delhi any more."PollIn your opinion, has the political climate affected the functioning of the Election Commission?Yes, it has a significant impact.No, it operates independently.Rahul Gandhi Releases New Video, Claims More 'Proof' On EC, BJP Collusion in Voter List FraudEnd of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous8 best anti-ageing ingredients you should start using in your 20sLifestyle10 best vegetarian sources of IronLifestyleSalwar tales by gorgeous lady Shabana ShajahantvCars under Rs 6 lakh with six airbags: Maruti Alto, Nissan Magnite and moreautoKundali Bhagya fame Shraddha Arya’s stunning ethnic lookstvAnupama Parameswaran shines bright in striking snapsEntertainment'Coolie' actress Reba Monica John’s picture-perfect momentsEntertainmentMalavika Mohanan's stunning style moments you can't missEntertainmentJannat Zubair’s Gen-Z Style is Pure PerfectiontvEver heard of Flying fish?
