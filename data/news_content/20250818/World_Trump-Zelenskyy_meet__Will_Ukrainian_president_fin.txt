This shift comes after criticism of his informal attire during a previous visit to the White House.  In high-stakes meeting between US President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart in Washington, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is likely to show up in more formal attire. According to a designer who earlier collaborated with Zelenskyy told Fox News that he most likely "will not appear in a polo." Ukrainian designer Elvira Gasanova said, "I think he will choose a black military suit or a military-style shirt with trousers — perhaps a jacket."After getting humiliated at the White House earlier for his informal attire, Gasanova said that this time he is likely to choose "a more serious look — though less symbolic.""After the recent ‘no suit’ drama, he will likely approach this question differently," she told Fox News. Earlier in February, the world witnessed a drama after a reporter questioned Zelenskyy over his informal outfit in White House. "Why don't you wear a suit? You're at the highest level in this country's office, and you refuse to wear a suit," one reporter asked. "… Do you own a suit?"Gasanova, who is the founder of Ukrainian fashion brands GASANOVA and DAMIRLI, revealed that Zelenskyy doesn't have a personal stylist, unlike other world leaders.
