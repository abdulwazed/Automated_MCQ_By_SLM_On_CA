AI-generated image NEW DELHI: Touching a raw nerve among the deprived communities and champions of social justice, a key parliamentary panel said the "Not Found Suitable (NFS)" tag should not be used to deny SC and ST teachers opportunities in appointments and promotions, acknowledging the prevalence of the controversial practice while urging "better judgment" in recruitment of faculty members in universities.The Parliamentary Committee on SC/ST Welfare, while making the observation in context of a review of appointments in Delhi University, weighed in on a subject that has become a matter of wider concern. "While interacting with SC/ST teachers welfare association of DU, a glaring issue that came to fore was declaration of SC/ST teachers as 'NFS' for posts earmarked for them," it noted in a report tabled in the Parliament in its ongoing monsoon session."The committee vehemently condemns the usage of the term 'NFS' to deny eligible SC/ST teachers opportunities in appointments and promotions. The committee opines that declaring SC/ST candidates 'NFS' is not only inappropriate and hurts the sentiments of deserving, eligible and well qualified SC/ST candidates," the panel, headed by BJP MP Faggan Singh Kulaste, noted.The NFS debate revolves around allegations that authorities in educational institutions are manipulating fair employment opportunities for Dalits and tribals by dismissing candidatures as lacking suitability for faculty positions. Claiming large-scale vacancies against SC/ST quota in central universities, leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi recently blamed the governing BJP dispensation for 'NFS', which, he said, was being used to deny the marginalised communities leadership roles in education."NFS is the new Manuvaad now. Eligible candidates from SC/ST/OBC communities are being deliberately declared 'unsuitable' so that they are kept away from education and leadership," he had posted on social media, triggering strong backlash from BJP that accused Congress for marginalising the backward classes.Now, the parliamentary panel has said "in the present era there is no dearth of eligible SC/ST candidates holding impressive credentials in teaching fields. The committee recommend that SC/ST candidates applying for teaching posts should be judged solely on their academic prowess and that strict norms should not cloud the better judgement of selection panel."The panel urged that SC/ST candidates should be given ample opportunities and should be helped in achieving their professional goals.
