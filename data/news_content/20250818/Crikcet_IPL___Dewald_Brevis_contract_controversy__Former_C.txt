Which I feel is, first of all, very, very wrong. Being a current player, being in the same team, talking about another player's contract - even though it might have been in a different context - this is the problem it can lead to,” Anirudha said on the Cheeky Cheeka YouTube channel.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! “You never talk about another person's contract, first of all. And because of that, CSK have strongly put out a statement. All the fans have been given that ease, stating: don’t worry at all, for the next two years this player is only for us,” he added. The row began when Ashwin suggested that CSK were willing to pay “extra” to sign Brevis in IPL 2025. The comments sparked speculation about the legality of the move, and led to the franchise releasing a clarification. Responding to the backlash, the former India spinner clarified that his remarks were never about finances. “My intent in the old video was to talk about Brevis’ batting, not about his IPL signing amount,” Ashwin explained. “We have to understand that every player who plays in the IPL has a contract with the franchise and the tournament. If there is anything wrong, it won’t be ratified. My point was about his batting, not money.”PollDo you think R Ashwin's comments about Dewald Brevis' contract were inappropriate?Yes, absolutelyNo, it was just a discussion He also underlined the importance of addressing such controversies quickly in the current media landscape. “In today’s time, there is a need to clarify the right things as well. No mistake has been made by the franchise, the player or the governing body,” Ashwin said. While Ashwin moved to set the record straight, Anirudha’s sharp criticism offers a reminder as to how sensitive matters like contract discussions are and that him speaking up about it while being a current teammate was far from ideal.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
