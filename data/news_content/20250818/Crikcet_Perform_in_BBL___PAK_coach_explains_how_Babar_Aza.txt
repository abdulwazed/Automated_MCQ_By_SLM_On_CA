The 30-year-old has been sidelined from the shortest format since late 2024, with selectors leaving him out of both the upcoming tri-series against UAE and Afghanistan and next month’s Asia Cup.'Perform in BBL': PAK coach Mike Hesson explains how Babar Azam can return to T20I squad after Asia Cup snub Hesson made it clear that while Babar remains a top-quality player, he needs to show progress in specific areas before reclaiming his spot. “There is no doubt Babar’s been asked to improve in some areas around taking on spin and in terms of his strike rate. Those are things he is working really hard on,” the coach said as quoted by the ICC.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Babar’s recent form has been inconsistent. He struck 47 in the first ODI against West Indies in Trinidad but followed it with scores of 0 and 9. His T20 record last year, of 738 runs in 24 matches at strike rates of 129.22 and 133.21, invited criticism for not being quick enough in a format where acceleration is crucial. Hesson suggested that Babar’s best chance to make a statement will come in December and January, when he is expected to feature in the BBL. “A player like Babar has an opportunity to play in the BBL and show he is improving in those areas in T20s. He is too good a player not to consider,” Hesson said. The coach also explained why others had been preferred in the current squad. “At the moment the players we have, have done exceptionally well. Sahibzada Farhan has played six games (against Bangladesh and West Indies) and won three Player of the Match awards,” he pointed out. Mohammad Rizwan’s exclusion was another notable call, with selectors opting to back batters who consistently score at a high strike rate.PollWhat do you believe is the main reason for Babar Azam's exclusion from the T20I side?Inconsistent performanceOther players performing better Hesson stressed the importance of rewarding recent form. “We need a run rate that puts us ahead of the game. T20 is all about setting the game up and being ahead of the game all the time,” he said.
