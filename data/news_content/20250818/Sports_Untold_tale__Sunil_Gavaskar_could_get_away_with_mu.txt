LONDON, ENGLAND - AUGUST 03: Media member and former Indian cpatain, Sunil Gavaskar speaks during day four of the Fifth Test Match between England and India at The Kia Oval on August 03, 2025 in London, England. (Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images) Former India cricketer Karsan Ghavri shared a few interesting facts about his ex-teammate Sunil Gavaskar and explained why the legendary India batter's aura will remain unmatched in Indian cricket.Ghavri said once the Indian team was playing a Test match against Australia at the then Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in Delhi. On the day of the game, former Prime Minister Morarji Desai was scheduled to meet players from both sides. However, Mr. Desai arrived 10 minutes late, and by then the toss had already taken place, with India set to bat first.Virat Kohli, Ravi Shastri & India’s Pace Revolution | Bharat Arun Reveals Untold Team India StoriesGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"Sunil Gavaskar was all set. Padded up. He was sitting in the dressing room and concentrating," Ghavri told Vickey Lalwani on his YouTube channel."Raj Singh Dungarpur was there, and in the meantime, he was concentrating. Sunil was about to go out and bat in a few minutes. Raj Singh said, 'Come on, everyone. The Prime Minister is here. The introduction will take place. It will take just 2-3 minutes.'"Everybody went out, but Sunil said, 'I am not coming.' He said, 'Let me concentrate. My batting is important for me and my team.' They left him alone.PollWhich aspect of Sunil Gavaskar's career do you find most impressive?His dedication to batting.His ability to remain unfazed under pressure.His consistency over the years."Sunil batted till tea, and scored some runs also. At the end of the day’s play, we didn’t know that the PM had come to the dressing room only to meet Gavaskar."This is how Sunil Gavaskar, in his prime, right from 1971 to 1987, was always a champion. He could get away with murder."The former Indian pacer recalled a few incidents to illustrate how Sunil Gavaskar often had his way, no matter the circumstances. One of the most infamous examples came during the 1975 World Cup, when Gavaskar played a painfully slow innings of 36 runs off 174 balls. The knock left his teammates in the dressing room frustrated, yet the Little Master remained unmoved and stuck to his approach."We, as Indian cricketers, did not know how to play one-day cricket. In the first match, England scored 334, but when we came to bat, Sunil played out all 60 overs in that particular match," Ghavri said."So many times, messages were sent, asking him to either accelerate or get out, trying to pick up the pace. But Sunil Gavaskar was Sunil Gavaskar in the 1970s."He wouldn't listen to anyone. He just played out Tony Greig, Geoff Arnold, Chris Old and Bob Willis. The reason he gave after the match was, 'I was facing these guys, practising against them for the Test matches in the future.'"There was turmoil in the dressing room. When our manager asked him, Gavaskar said, 'Leave me alone'," Ghavri added.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
