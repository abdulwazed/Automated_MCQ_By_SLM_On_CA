Oscar-winning actor Leonardo DiCaprio, 50, and Italian model Vittoria Ceretti, 27, were spotted enjoying a romantic yacht trip off the coast of Formentera, Spain.

Sun, sea and a little PDAAccording to the pictures and videos published by Daily Mail, the couple clearly made the most of their Mediterranean getaway. They lounged on the yacht, took dips in the sparkling blue waters, and mingled with friends on board. At one sweet moment, Ceretti placed her hand on DiCaprio’s back as they climbed the yacht stairs together. A relaxed day in the sun turned into a picture-perfect PDA moment.Rare public appearance sparks excitementThough linked since August 2023, DiCaprio and Ceretti are rarely seen together in public. Their yacht outing gave fans a rare and intimate look at a love that has stayed mostly under wraps.Jet-setting lovebirdsThe couple seems to share a love for travel and luxury trips. Earlier this summer, they were spotted at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez’s wedding celebrations in Venice. On June 26, they were photographed leaving the Gritti Palace Hotel before the wedding welcome party. DiCaprio was effortlessly sharp in a dark suit and cap, while Ceretti looked chic in a long neutral dress with stitching details, a stylish updo, and a nude clutch bag.Ceretti opens up about high-profile loveEarlier this year, Ceretti spoke for the first time about dating someone famous in Vogue France. While she didn’t name DiCaprio directly, the magazine called him a “very, very famous actor.”The model said they first met in Milan but didn’t share more details. She also reflected on the pressures of dating in the spotlight. “As soon as you're in a relationship with someone who has a larger following than you, you become 'girlfriend of', or 'boyfriend of,' for that matter. And that can be extremely annoying,” she told Vogue France.Labels can be limitingCeretti added, “Suddenly, people are talking about you as so-and-so's girlfriend who was so-and-so's ex. So, it's not nice to think that you can't love whoever you want, because of the labels people need to stick on you.”Yet, she said love can rise above all the noise. “If what you're experiencing is real, if you know you love each other, then there's no reason to be alarmed. Because love protects and gives confidence."Since their romance became public, DiCaprio and Ceretti have kept things mostly private but have been spotted together at a few events and trips.
