This initiative is part of broader reforms to empower local talent and modernize the legal sector. Similar national workforce integration efforts are underway in vital sectors like oil and technical fields, with stricter recruitment rules for expatriates. Justice Ministry commits to full Kuwaitization of judicial staff by 2030/Image: File Kuwait’s Minister of Justice, Counsellor Nasser Al-Sumait, has confirmed that the country’s judiciary will be fully “Kuwaitized” by 2030, meaning all judicial positions, currently sometimes held by foreign workers will be occupied by qualified Kuwaiti nationals. This initiative forms a core pillar of sweeping reforms to strengthen local talent, empower national professionals, and modernize the legal sector.TL;DR:Kuwait’s judiciary aims to be staffed entirely by citizens by 2030 as part of “Kuwaitization.”The transition is underway across judicial departments, with Legislative reforms also in motion to boost independence and efficiency.Private and public sectors, especially oil and technical fields, are undergoing similar national workforce integration, including strict recruitment and job protection rules.Details of the judicial Kuwaitization driveMinister Al-Sumait states that procedures are already advancing within all judicial departments to replace expatriate judges and staff with skilled Kuwaiti professionals as per a report by People Matters. “The matter has been decided, and we are committed to achieving 100% Kuwaitization by 2030,” he declared, underlining the determination behind the plan. The Ministry of Justice is coordinating closely to ensure that all appointments and promotions prioritize quality, training, and readiness among Kuwaiti candidates.Coupled with the ambitious staffing goal, the Judicial Independence Law is under legislative review intended to secure the judiciary’s autonomy, improve administrative frameworks, and align national structures with contemporary legal best practices. The approach emphasizes not just nationalization, but also efficiency, capability, and global alignment.Kuwaitization across sectorsThe Judiciary initiative follows notable progress in other vital sectors. Kuwait’s oil industry, already Kuwaitized in key engineering and technical roles serves as a model. Local workforce integration in oil is supported by the Manpower Contractors Kuwaitization Initiative (begun in 2002), offering fair wages, benefits, and stable employment for nationals. As of 2024, the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) and subsidiaries have reportedly reached 100% national staffing in top positions, with ongoing efforts to remove barriers for Kuwaitis, ensure job continuity, and phase out reliance on foreign staff.Tightened recruitment for technical & professional rolesThe Public Authority for Manpower has also introduced new, stricter requirements for expatriates seeking technical posts, such as medicine, engineering, law, education, accounting, and finance. All candidates must now pass an online professional proficiency test and undergo thorough academic and work experience verification, typically three to five years via official bodies and Kuwaiti embassies abroad. For existing foreign workers and those switching sectors, changes in job titles or academic records are tightly regulated to ensure only appropriately qualified staff remain.Any roles involving security screening require explicit clearance from the Authority before obtaining Ministry of Interior approval, reinforcing comprehensive compliance and oversight.Kuwait’s sweeping Kuwaitization campaign in the judiciary and beyond seeks to empower Kuwaiti nationals, modernize the labour landscape, and drive sustainable long-term development. Legislative changes, stricter recruitment, and a focus on homegrown talent reflect a national strategy for competitive, capable, and independent institutions across the board.FAQ1.
