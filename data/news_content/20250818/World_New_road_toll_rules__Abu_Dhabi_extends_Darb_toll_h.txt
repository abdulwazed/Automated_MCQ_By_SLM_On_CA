Abu Dhabi will extend Darb road toll operating hours by an additional two hours daily/Representative Image Abu Dhabi will extend Darb road toll operating hours by an additional two hours daily from September 1, 2025, as part of updates aimed at easing city traffic congestion and encouraging public transport use. The new rules also scrap the daily and monthly fee caps, marking major changes for regular commuters across the capital.TL;DR:Darb toll hours are extended: Evening charges apply from 3pm to 7pm, Monday to Saturday (previously 5pm to 7pm).Dh4 toll applies per pass at all four main bridges during morning (7am–9am) and new extended afternoon hours.Daily and monthly toll caps are removed; charges are now unlimited. Exemptions remain for eligible groups, and tolls do not apply on Sundays or public holidays.New toll timings and locationsFrom September 1, 2025, motorists in Abu Dhabi will pay Dh4 for each trip through Darb toll gates between 3pm and 7pm (Monday to Saturday), in addition to the unchanged morning window of 7am to 9am. Tolls are not charged outside these peak periods, nor on Sundays and public holidays. Abu Dhabi’s four main toll gates are at Sheikh Khalifa Bridge, Sheikh Zayed Bridge, Al Maqta Bridge, and Musaffah Bridge, key entrance points to the city. These changes are managed by Q Mobility, under the Department of Municipalities and Transport.A major update is the removal of daily and monthly fee limits, meaning motorists will pay the Dh4 charge each time they use a toll gate during charging hours. Previously, charges could not exceed Dh16 per day, while monthly caps depended on how many vehicles a user owned. With caps abolished, high-frequency users should budget accordingly.Exemptions and policy rationaleExemption policies remain unchanged for people with disabilities, low-income families, senior citizens, and retirees. The extension and cap removal are intended to improve peak hour traffic flow, reduce congestion, and prompt more commuters to consider public transit, especially given the city’s ongoing population boom. Abu Dhabi’s population now exceeds 4.1 million, up 51% in a decade; surging vehicle registrations and rapid development underscore the importance of adaptive traffic management strategies in the emirate.With extended toll hours and the removal of daily and monthly payment limits, Abu Dhabi is signaling a shift toward tighter congestion control and stronger incentives for public transport. Motorists are urged to adjust their travel habits and budgets as these new rules take effect.FAQ1.
