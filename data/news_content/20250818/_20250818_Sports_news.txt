The selection decision remains complex due to India's packed top-order batting lineup and scheduling challenges, with multiple players vying for limited spots.   Gill has already established himself as a formidable force in ODIs, accumulating 2,775 runs and 22 fifty-plus scores in 55 matches. Reports suggest he could potentially return to the T20I team as vice-captain and might be in line for ODI leadership once current captain Rohit Sharma retires.   In his most recent T20 appearance during IPL 2025, Gill demonstrated his prowess by scoring 650 runs at a strike rate of nearly 156, including six fifties in 15 matches, finishing as the fourth-highest run-getter.   Gill's T20I career has shown steady improvement. He concluded 2024 with 266 runs in eight T20Is at an average of 38.00 and a strike rate of 133, including two fifties during the Zimbabwe series. His overall T20I statistics stand at 578 runs in 21 matches at an average of 30.42 and a strike rate exceeding 139.   The scheduling complexity poses a significant challenge for selectors. The Asia Cup final concludes on September 28, with home Tests against West Indies beginning October 2. This tight schedule requires careful consideration in team selection.   India's T20I performance has been remarkable since their T20 World Cup victory, winning 17 out of 20 bilateral series. During Gill's absence, several players have strengthened their positions in the team.   Abhishek Sharma has particularly impressed, scoring 279 runs against England with a strike rate of 220, including a spectacular 135 off 54 balls at Wankhede. Since the last T20 World Cup, he has amassed 1,363 runs in 42 matches at an average of 34.94 and a strike rate exceeding 198.   Tilak Varma has also shown consistent performance, scoring 1,200 runs in 36 matches at an average of 50.00 and a strike rate of 153.84 since the last T20 World Cup. He recorded two centuries during the South Africa tour.   Sanju Samson has reinvented himself as an opener alongside Abhishek, scoring 908 runs in 31 T20s at an average of 33.62 and a strike rate of 157.09 since the last T20 World Cup.   Captain Suryakumar Yadav has contributed 1,107 runs in T20s at an average of 36.90 and a strike rate of 161.13, though his international form has declined recently.   Gill's recent T20 statistics remain impressive, with 893 runs in 22 matches at an average of 47.00 and a strike rate over 147 since the last T20 World Cup.   Yashasvi Jaiswal, who like Gill last played T20I in July 2024, presents another strong candidacy with 723 runs in 23 T20Is, including a century and five fifties at a strike rate exceeding 164.   The current Samson-Abhishek opening combination makes it challenging to accommodate both Gill and Jaiswal in the playing XI. With a 15-member squad limit for the Asia Cup and World Cup, selecting all four players - Abhishek, Samson, Gill, and Jaiswal - appears unlikely, considering the need for backup players in other roles.   The final selection may come down to choosing between Jaiswal and Gill, with Samson holding an advantage as a wicketkeeper-batsman. The selectors will need to evaluate who can make a more significant impact in the upcoming tournaments. 18:32 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Will Shreyas Iyer feature in the squad?With Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, and Axar Patel already assured of their middle-order roles, India still has room for two — possibly even three or more batting spots to fill.At No. 3, the battle is shaping up between Tilak Varma, who currently holds the position, and Shreyas Iyer. Shreyas had a standout IPL 2025 with Punjab Kings, striking at 175.07 — the third-best in IPL history for a season with 600 or more runs, behind only Chris Gayle (2011) and Suryakumar (2023). His ability to take on spin adds further weight to his case.18:12 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Too many options? India selectors face a happy headacheIndian selectors are spoilt for choices ahead of a big T20 season, thanks to extensive IPL scouting, which has broadened the player pool. This allows a shift in gears for the format.

However, his last series against England was not very encouraging, as he managed only 51 runs and repeatedly fell to the short ball against Jofra Archer.

The T20I tournament, scheduled in the UAE from September 9-28, will see India compete in Group A alongside Pakistan, UAE, and Oman, with the event being viewed as a crucial testing ground for India's T20I core ahead of next year's T20 World Cup.The selection committee faces important decisions regarding the opening batting positions for the tournament. With Rohit Sharma's absence confirmed, the competition for opening slots has intensified between players like Shubman Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and Sanju Samson."There are a few talking points regarding the Asia Cup. The first question that comes to everyone's mind is whether Shubman Gill fits into the T20 plans because in the last World Cup, Yashasvi Jaiswal was the backup opener," Ashwin said on his YouTube channel. "So Jaiswal automatically gets a kick-in. Rohit Sharma is not going to be a part of that team, so Jaiswal automatically gets a look-in. Now, who is going to be that other opener?"The selection scenario is further complicated by the recent performances of multiple players vying for spots in the team. Gill's impressive recent Test series performance and Samson's success as a T20 opener have created additional considerations for the selectors."Shubman Gill had an outstanding series. Can he return to the squad? Sanju Samson has had a fabulous run as a T20 opener for India. So I think it is a tricky state for the selectors," Ashwin explained.The selection committee must also consider the potential return of Shreyas Iyer to the squad. "Can Shreyas Iyer make a comeback? There is a lot of decision-making that the selectors have to make," Ashwin remarked.08:53 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Pakistan squadSalman Ali Agha (captain), Abrar Ahmed, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Hasan Nawaz, Hussain Talat, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Haris (wicket-keeper), Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Waseem Jnr, Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, Salman Mirza, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Sufyan Moqim.08:45 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Gill vs Jaiswal – the final selection battle?Yashasvi Jaiswal, who last played a T20I in July 2024, has 723 runs in 23 matches at a strike rate of 164+, including a century. With only 15 squad spots available, selectors may have to choose between Gill and Jaiswal, with Samson holding an edge as a keeper-batter.08:44 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Samson-Abhishek partnership complicates mattersSanju Samson has reinvented himself as Abhishek’s opening partner, scoring 908 runs at a strike rate of 157 since the last T20 World Cup. With Samson also doubling as a wicketkeeper, his inclusion strengthens India’s balance, making it harder for both Gill and Jaiswal to fit in.08:44 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Abhishek Sharma emerging as front-runnerAbhishek Sharma’s explosive form is making him hard to ignore. Against England, he hammered 279 runs at a strike rate of 220, including a 135 off 54 balls at Wankhede.

His IPL 2025 form was also strong, with 650 runs at a strike rate of 156.08:42 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Gill under consideration despite packed scheduleShubman Gill, India’s newly-appointed Test captain, is being considered for the T20 Asia Cup starting September 9. However, selectors face a dilemma due to India’s crowded top-order and the tight scheduling, with Tests against West Indies beginning just four days after the Asia Cup final.08:41 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: WelcomeHello and welcome to our live coverage of the Asia Cup squad announcement. The Asia Cup will be played in the UAE from September 9-28, with India scheduled to open their campaign against the hosts on September 10, while the marquee fixture against arch-rivals Pakistan is slated on September 14, both in Dubai.We will be bringing you all the live updates. Stay tuned.India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Ahead of the Ajit Agarkar-led selection panel's meeting to pick India's Asia Cup squad, all eyes will be on Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal, whether the two explosive batters will find a place in India's Asia Cup squad. 

The Asia Cup will be played in the UAE from September 9-28, with India scheduled to open their campaign against the hosts on September 10, while the marquee fixture against arch-rivals Pakistan is slated on September 14, both in Dubai.

If all are fit and available, Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson (batter-keeper), Tilak Varma, skipper Surya Kumar Yadav and Hardik Pandya are automatic selections in top-five.

Now with Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal, two players with proven IPL records are back in the mix, the selectors will have to make some compromise with regards to one or two slots.

And this is pretty clear that at least in this Asia Cup, both Gill and Jaiswal wouldn't be in the same squad till Abhishek and Sanju are automatic choices.

India are placed along with arch-rivals Pakistan in Group A, also featuring the UAE and Oman, in the eight-team Asia Cup tournament which will be held from September 9 to 28.TrendingSuryakumar YadavSaaniya ChandhokMS DhoniShahid AfridiIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementGautam GambhirVirat KohliCincinnati Open Final Live StreamingKedar JadhavR AshwinSuryakumar YadavSaaniya ChandhokMS DhoniShahid AfridiIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementGautam GambhirVirat KohliCincinnati Open Final Live StreamingKedar JadhavR AshwinSuryakumar YadavSaaniya ChandhokMS DhoniShahid AfridiIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementGautam GambhirVirat KohliCincinnati Open Final Live StreamingKedar JadhavR AshwinTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTop Stories Right NowAsia Cup 2025: Suryakumar Yadav to stay as India’s T20I captain, Shubman Gill li...Cricket | 'Ek banda fail hue ja raha hai 3, 4, 5 saal...' - Irfan Pathan backs G...Blast from the past: Arjun Tendulkar’s fiancée Saaniya Chandhok spotted in old v...More TOP StoriesQuick LinksWTC Points TableNHL NewsNBA NewsEsports and Gaming NewsLatest Cricket NewsWWE NewsCricket Match ScheduleInternational SportsMLB NewsNFL NewsEducation NewsLive Cricket ScoreExplore Every CornerAcross The GlobeIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementTravis KelceRussell Wilson WifeDwyane Wade WifeVanessa BryantLebron JamesMumbai RainsAuston MatthewTravis Hunter WifeLeanna LeneeWWE RAW PreviewCraig BerubeTrump Zelenskyy MeetingSamuel MontembeaultWayne GretzkyCaleb WilliamsSpencer RattlerSophie Cunningham InjuryChris BoswellDeng MayarCP Radhakrishnan Educational QualificationHangor-class submarineITR Filing 2025Bank Holidays AugustGSTFlorida turnpike accidentBrooklyn shootingMumbai RainsQantas AirwaysConnor McDavidAbout usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesLiving and EntertainmentCricbuzzLifestyleNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTVTimes PrimeTravel DestinationsWhats HotETimesTimes LifeTimes PetsMyLifeXPServicesCouponDuniaTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgetsTimes EventsWork with UsColombiaHot on the WebCloves Health BenefitsTulsi Health BenefitsBlood Pressure ManagementLow CholesterolKidney Disease SymptomsLongest International RiverGuava Health BenefitsLow Value CurrencyHome Aquarium Setup GuideFoods That Weaken BonesKidney Cancer SymptomsJaved AkhtarArmaan MalikShah Rukh KhanHrithik RoshanAnushka SharmaAjithLiver Disease SymptomsColon Cancer SymptomsMonsoon Snake PreventionJessica RadcliffeCobra Safety TipsWar 2 Box Office CollectionNational Couples Day WishesCoolie Movie ReviewCoolie Box Office CollectionMahavatar Narsimha Box Office CollectionKapil SharmaSaiyaara Box Office CollectionDarshan ThoogudeepaSaiyaara Movie ReviewColon Cancer SymptomsSanskrit EffectNatural SupplementsHigh Cholesterol SymptomsSide Effects Of Dragon FruitColorectal CancerOral SymptomsReduce Face Fat DietSide Effects Of BananasGinger Tea Side EffectsKidney Damage SymptomsTrending TopicsSunil GavaskarSchool Holidays ListRinku SinghJannik Sinner vs Carlos AlcarazArjun TendulkarShubman GillJKBOSE Bi Annual ExamRajasthan PTET Seat AllotmentPSSSB Group B RecruitmentSuryakumar YadavIGNOU July RegistrationCBSE CTET NotificationBSSC CGL 4 RecruitmentShah Rukh KhanNeymar JRKedar JadhavGautam GambhirJaved MiandadTN NEET UG Seat AllotmentMumbai RainsMeerut Army Jawan AssaultedDelhi Bomb ThreatJabalpur Bank RobberyBengaluru Assault NewsDelhi RapeManisha Murder CaseMumbai Heavy RainfallHyderabad Janmashtami NewsBhopal RapeMumbai RainfallParag AgrawalFastag Annual PassSam AltmanGeoffrey HintonSridhar VembuApple iPhone 17Nyt ConnectionsMega Tsunami WarningGithub CeoJamie DimonWordle TodaySteve JobsPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth+ TipsIndian TV ShowsTechnologyTravelEtimesHealth & FitnessNFLAugust Long Weekend 2025India vs EnglandAstrologyWeather TodayPlatinum Rate TodaySilver Rate TodayGold Rate TodayIs Bank open todayIs Bank Open TomorrowBank Holidays in AugustPublic Holidays in AugustStock Market HolidaysFinancial CalculatorsTechnology NewsInternational SportsPublic HolidaysBank HolidaysLatest NewsTop 5 entertainment news: Larissa Bonesi calls Aryan Khan 'unstoppable', Sunjay Kapur's sister praises Karisma Kapoor, Virat Kohli-Anushka Sharma chat with locals in London3 things parents can do if your child is burnt outYeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai: Maira questions why Abhira can’t marry Armaan againBanking-TieUp: BoM, SBI Card launch co-branded credit card;

India's player of the series India's captain Shubman Gill on day five of the fifth cricket test match between England and India at The Kia Oval in London, Monday, Aug. 4, 2025. (AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) NEW DELHI: The Asia Cup 2025 India squad is set to be announced, and the burning question is whether Test captain Shubman Gill will find a place in the team. With India’s T20I batting lineup already packed with hard-hitters like Abhishek Sharma, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson, Tilak Varma, captain Suryakumar Yadav, and Hardik Pandya, the selectors face a “sweet headache” when it comes to Gill’s inclusion.India’s top six T20I batters boast impressive strike rates: Abhishek Sharma (193.84), Suryakumar Yadav (167.07), Yashasvi Jaiswal (164.31), Hardik Pandya (141.67), Tilak Varma (155.07), and Sanju Samson (152.38).Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!In comparison, Gill has played 21 T20Is so far, with a strike rate of 139.27.So, will the selectors still back Shubman?Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh, who has closely observed Gill, strongly believes the youngster deserves a place in the squad.“In the T20 format, it’s important to understand that it’s not just about big hitting. If Shubman decides to attack, he can match anyone, because he is a very solid player with strong basics. A batter with such a strong foundation can score runs in any format," Harbhajan told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview."If you look at the IPL, Shubman has scored runs every season. He has worn the Orange Cap — and that doesn’t happen by chance. And it’s not like he bats only at a strike rate of 120 or 130; he can also bat at a strike rate of 160," he added."Yes, we do have players like Abhishek Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, and Tilak Varma, but you cannot undermine or underestimate Shubman Gill. He is a very talented batter who can adapt to any format. He is an all-format player. In my opinion, he can play T20s and even dominate the format. We as fans are used to seeing fours and sixes every ball, but you also need batters who can play long innings and rescue the team when required,” Harbhajan said.When asked to name his 15 for the Asia Cup, which is set to be picked on Tuesday, Harbhajan replied: "I think the squad should be: Yashasvi Jaiswal, Abhishek Sharma, Shubman Gill, Suryakumar Yadav – the captain, Hardik Pandya, Shreyas Iyer, Washington Sundar, Riyan Parag for the middle order, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Mohammed Siraj, Arshdeep Singh, KL Rahul, Jasprit Bumrah and Rishabh Pant.”'CRICKET NEVER STOPS FOR ANYONE'The Asia Cup will mark India’s first major multi-team tournament without stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. The duo featured in India’s previous two global triumphs — the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 and the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 — both won under Rohit’s leadership.This, as Harbhajan puts it, is the beginning of a new era.“See, cricket never stops for anyone. Whether we talk about the time of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, or Sachin Tendulkar, the game has always gone on. Someone or the other comes in and takes the team forward. Right now, the way Shubman Gill and his team-mates have played in England… Rohit and Virat have left their legacy in the right hands. We have seen the shift happen smoothly. It will be a big tournament that will be played without Virat and Rohit," Harbhajan said.PollShould Shubman Gill be included in the Asia Cup 2025 squad?Yes, he deserves a spotNo, we have better options"The way these youngsters have taken responsibility… I believe this is the natural rule of life — change is inevitable. If there is no change, things become stagnant. Moving forward is always good. And the way Shubman Gill and his team-mates have performed, it’s really pleasing to see."Of course, we have seen this shift earlier as well. When the big players move on, someone else steps up, takes responsibility, and carries the team forward. As long as the team keeps moving in the right direction, that is the main goal. The way Gill and his team have played in England, Rohit and Virat have definitely left their legacy in safe hands,” he added.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

RR's Vaibhav Suryavanshi celebrates his fifty (PTI Photo/Manvender Vashist Lav) Former India captain Kris Srikkanth has advocated for 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi's inclusion in India's 15-member squad for the upcoming Asia Cup T20, starting September 9. Srikkanth's endorsement comes as selectors prepare to finalize the squad on August 19, amid intense competition for spots, particularly in the opening positions.Vaibhav Suryavanshi has emerged as a strong contender following his performance in IPL 2025, where he scored 252 runs in seven matches for Rajasthan Royals at a strike rate exceeding 200. He also claimed the second-fastest century in IPL history, reaching the milestone in 35 deliveries against Gujarat Titans.Everything is special about Vaibhav Suryavanshi: Vikram RathourGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!The young prodigy continued his impressive form during the U19 tour of England, scoring a century and delivering strong performances in both one-day and four-day formats."You have to play bold. Don't make him wait. Don't say things like 'let him mature'. He is already playing with remarkable maturity. His shot-making has been on another level. If I were chairman, I would definitely have him in the squad," Srikkanth stated on his YouTube show.The selection discussion involves several established players, including Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson, who have secured their positions with an aggressive approach under coach Gautam Gambhir. Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill and current IPL Orange Cap holder Sai Sudharsan are also in contention.Srikkanth expressed uncertainty about Sanju Samson's inclusion in the squad and outlined his preferred opening combinations."Samson is doubtful, according to me," Srikkanth said. "My first-choice opener is Abhishek Sharma, no doubt. I will have two more openers. My picks would be Vaibhav Suryavanshi or Sai Sudharsan, with Shubman Gill as an option. If I were a selector, I would keep Vaibhav in the 15 for the T20 World Cup. He has been outstanding."PollShould Vaibhav Suryavanshi be included in India's squad for the Asia Cup T20?Yes, absolutely!No, he should wait."I think it should be Yashasvi Jaiswal, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, and Sai Sudharsan. I would take two out of these three. That would be my preference," he added.Since the T20 World Cup final in June 2024, Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson have been India's leading run-scorers in T20 internationals. Both players have received support from the team management, including head coach Gambhir and captain Suryakumar Yadav, for their aggressive batting style.Abhishek has accumulated 535 runs at an average of 33.43 with a strike rate of 193.84, including two centuries during this period. Samson has scored three hundreds in 17 matches at a strike rate of 171.47.However, Samson's recent performance in the five-match series against England has raised concerns. He struggled against short-pitched bowling and recorded three single-digit scores in five innings.Srikkanth, who previously captained a 16-year-old Sachin Tendulkar during his debut in Pakistan in 1989, believes India should not delay incorporating Vaibhav into the national setup as they prepare for next year's T20 World Cup.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

The decision was made to manage Bumrah's workload, despite facing criticism.Bumrah, who has been prone to injuries, participated in the first, third, and fourth Tests while Mohammed Siraj led the pace attack in the remaining matches.Sharma, a former pace bowler himself, compared the situation to following a doctor's advice.Jasprit Bumrah press conference: Hits out at critics, on Lord's Honours Boards, ball controversyGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"If the medical team advises, if the doctor tells me that I have to take antibiotics, then I have to consume them," Sharma said in "The Great Indian Cricket Show" on Doordarshan. "If our physios are telling a player to manage workload, I think we should listen to them because they are the better judges."The comments were made at an event where Prasar Bharati, the country's public service broadcaster, signed a deal with London-based cricket analytics company.Sharma, who had a successful bowling partnership with Kapil Dev and claimed over 125 wickets in Tests and ODIs, expressed confidence in India's chances at the upcoming Asia Cup in the UAE."I know that whoever is selected will be the best for the country. And the kind of cricket we are playing right now, I'm really proud with the way India played in England," he added."And I'm very confident that we are definitely going to win the Asia Cup (to be played in T20 format) because soon after that we are playing the T20 World Cup (in 2026) in India."It's a very big thing when you are playing (the World Cup) in you own backyard. If the intent is right, the results will also be good."The event was attended by notable cricket personalities including Madan Lal from the 1983 World Cup-winning team, former India players Murali Kartik and Aakash Chopra, along with Prasar Bharati Chairman Navneet Kumar Sehgal.When asked about including Test captain Shubman Gill, who scored four centuries in the drawn England series, in the Asia Cup squad under Suryakumar Yadav's leadership, Sharma emphasised the need for selecting the best possible team. "Look, that is up to the selectors what they see. My opinion does not matter because I am no longer the chairman (of selectors), so I will only say that the best possible team should be selected," he stated."We have such good cricketers that not just the top-15 but even if the top-30 are selected, they are all very good.

Indian cricket team Mumbai: The focus is likely to be on maintaining continuity and keeping faith in the young and successful T20 specialists when the Indian selectors meet here at the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) headquarters on Tuesday to pick the squad for the Asia Cup (to be played in the T20 format) in the UAE, scheduled from September 9-28.The meeting will be attended by India's T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav, who will fly in from Bengaluru after clearing his fitness test at the BCCI's Centre of Excellence (CoE), which means SKY stays on as India’s T20 captain, possibly till the 2026 T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.EXCLUSIVE: India to boycott Pakistan in Asia Cup? Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Contrary to expectations, star batter and India's Test captain Shubman Gill, who was tipped in some quarters to take over the vice-captaincy role in the T20 format after a highly successful tour of England, where he scored 754 runs in five Tests @75.40 with a top score of 269, is currently struggling to even make it to what is likely to be not more than a 15-man squad -- unless head coach Gautam Gambhir pushes for his inclusion in the T20 format too."Gill is a terrific batsman, all the selectors and head coach Gautam Gambhir are huge fans of his batting, and he is rated almost as highly as Virat Kohli in India’s cricket circles in terms of potential. However, he doesn’t fit into the T20 scheme of things right now. Presently, the idea is to persist with ‘keeper-bat Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma as openers, with Tilak Varma coming in at No. 3 and skipper Suryakumar at No. 4. If you see, Abhishek and Varma are rated as the No. 1 & No. 2 batters in T20Is in the ICC rankings currently. How can you keep them out?" a source close to the developments told TOI.Gill had a successful IPL 2025 too, where he slammed 650 runs in 15 matches @50.00, at a strike rate of 155.87, with six fifties, while captaining the Gujarat Titans. Along with young left-hander Sai Sudharsan, the 25-year-old forged an extremely prolific opening combination for GT.India captain Shubman Gill speaks during a press conference at Edgbaston, Birmingham, England, Tuesday July 1, 2025. AP/PTI(AP07_01_2025_000278A)However, Samson, Sharma, and Varma have done enough in T20Is last year to have the team management's confidence in them, at least for now. Samson smashed three hundreds in T20Is last year -- two against South Africa in an away series (107 & 109*) and one (111) against Bangladesh at Hyderabad in the home series. Tilak cracked back-to-back centuries (107 not out & 120 not out) against South Africa in November 2024. The 22-year-old had an average IPL this time for the Mumbai Indians, managing 343 runs in 16 matches @31.18 with two fifties, but that is unlikely to be held against him."Even Hardik Pandya had a bad IPL last year (while captaining MI), but he turned out to be one of India’s biggest heroes of their 2024 T20 World Cup triumph in the West Indies. Even greats like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have endured bad IPLs, but they were a different beast while playing for India in T20Is. You can’t judge a player just by one IPL," a source pointed out.Abhishek, of course, is a certainty after bludgeoning a scintillating 135 off just 54 balls, including 13 sixes and seven fours, against England at the Wankhede Stadium on February 2 this year. Incidentally, it was the last T20I India played before the Asia Cup.New Delhi: Sunrisers Hyderabad's Abhishek Sharma plays a shot during an Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 T20 cricket match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Sunrisers Hyderabad, at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, in New Delhi. (PTI Photo/Atul Yadav)  *** Local Caption ***"The current top four in India’s T20 cricket reflect their new-found resolve to play fearlessly in this format. In fact, if you are talking about taking a third opener in the Asia Cup squad, the case of Yashasvi Jaiswal is stronger than Gill's. Jaiswal has the tendency to hit a lot more boundaries in the Powerplay overs, which is mandatory in today’s T20 cricket. If you remember, Jaiswal was in India’s main squad in the T20 World Cup last year, while Gill was in the reserves," the source said.However, it’s learnt that Jaiswal, who scored two hundreds in the Test series in England (101 at Leeds & 118 at The Oval), has been asked to focus on red-ball cricket for now, considering India are scheduled to play four home Tests in the 2025-26 season—two each against West Indies and South Africa.PollWho do you think should be the vice-captain for India's T20 squad?Shubman GillSanju SamsonAbhishek SharmaShreyas IyerIyer too struggling to make the cutLike Gill, Shreyas Iyer is also struggling to make the cut, despite captaining Punjab Kings to the final of IPL 2025 and being in blazing form with the bat. The 30-year-old was India’s top run-getter in their Champions Trophy triumph in Dubai in March, scoring 243 runs in five matches @48.60, including two fifties. He scored 79 off 98 against New Zealand in the group stage, then 45 off 62 against Australia in the semifinal, and 48 off 62 in the final. However, he is competing with big-hitting left-handers, allrounder Shivam Dube and ‘finisher’ Rinku Singh.Bumrah set to be back, Siraj likely to be restedIn encouraging news for Team India, world No. 1 pacer Jasprit Bumrah, who played three Tests in England and was under the scanner for workload management, has conveyed his availability to the selectors for the Asia Cup, and will thus lead India’s attack."Bumrah had a minor knee injury, but will be fit for the Asia Cup. He is supposed to report to the BCCI’s CoE on August 30 for a fitness assessment," a source told TOI.London: India's Jasprit Bumrah and Prasidh Krishna during a training session ahead of the fifth Test cricket match between India and England, in London. (PTI Photo/R Senthilkumar)With the final of the Asia Cup set for September 28 in Dubai and the first Test against West Indies starting on October 2 in Ahmedabad, there’s a fair chance that Bumrah will miss at least the first Test of that series. Meanwhile, pacer Mohammed Siraj, who took nine for 190 in the fifth Test at The Oval and finished with 23 wickets in the England series, is likely to be rested from the Asia Cup. He will, however, be available for the home Tests.Apart from Bumrah, left-arm seamer Arshdeep Singh, Prasidh Krishna -- who won the Purple Cap in IPL 2025 with 25 wickets in 15 matches @19.52 for Gujarat Titans -- and Hardik Pandya will be the other seamers. Prasidh, though, could be competing for a spot with Delhi pacer Harshit Rana.Among spinners, Varun Chakravarthy and Kuldeep Yadav are certainties on the slow UAE wickets, while off-spinning allrounder Washington Sundar is almost guaranteed a spot.Kolkata: Kolkata Knight Riders' Varun Chakravarthy celebrates with teammates after taking the wicket of Chennai Super Kings' Dewald Brevis during an Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 T20 cricket match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Chennai Super Kings, at the Eden Gardens, in Kolkata, West Bengal. (PTI Photo/Swapan Mahapatra)The Asia Cup will begin with Afghanistan vs Hong Kong in Abu Dhabi on September 9. Clubbed in Group A with arch-rivals Pakistan, UAE and Oman, India will launch their campaign against UAE on September 10 in Dubai. They take on Pakistan on September 14 in the league stage, and most likely again in the Super Four stage on September 21. The final is scheduled for September 28.Jitesh Sharma, a star performer for IPL 2025 champions RCB (261 runs in 15 matches @37.28, SR 176.35, including a top score of 85*), is expected to be picked as the second wicketkeeper in the squad.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

(Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images) Former India cricketer Karsan Ghavri shared a few interesting facts about his ex-teammate Sunil Gavaskar and explained why the legendary India batter's aura will remain unmatched in Indian cricket.Ghavri said once the Indian team was playing a Test match against Australia at the then Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in Delhi. On the day of the game, former Prime Minister Morarji Desai was scheduled to meet players from both sides. However, Mr. Desai arrived 10 minutes late, and by then the toss had already taken place, with India set to bat first.Virat Kohli, Ravi Shastri & India’s Pace Revolution | Bharat Arun Reveals Untold Team India StoriesGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

He was sitting in the dressing room and concentrating," Ghavri told Vickey Lalwani on his YouTube channel."Raj Singh Dungarpur was there, and in the meantime, he was concentrating. Sunil was about to go out and bat in a few minutes. Raj Singh said, 'Come on, everyone. The Prime Minister is here. The introduction will take place. It will take just 2-3 minutes.'"Everybody went out, but Sunil said, 'I am not coming.' He said, 'Let me concentrate. My batting is important for me and my team.' They left him alone.PollWhich aspect of Sunil Gavaskar's career do you find most impressive?His dedication to batting.His ability to remain unfazed under pressure.His consistency over the years."Sunil batted till tea, and scored some runs also. At the end of the day’s play, we didn’t know that the PM had come to the dressing room only to meet Gavaskar."This is how Sunil Gavaskar, in his prime, right from 1971 to 1987, was always a champion. He could get away with murder."The former Indian pacer recalled a few incidents to illustrate how Sunil Gavaskar often had his way, no matter the circumstances. One of the most infamous examples came during the 1975 World Cup, when Gavaskar played a painfully slow innings of 36 runs off 174 balls. The knock left his teammates in the dressing room frustrated, yet the Little Master remained unmoved and stuck to his approach."We, as Indian cricketers, did not know how to play one-day cricket. In the first match, England scored 334, but when we came to bat, Sunil played out all 60 overs in that particular match," Ghavri said."So many times, messages were sent, asking him to either accelerate or get out, trying to pick up the pace. But Sunil Gavaskar was Sunil Gavaskar in the 1970s."He wouldn't listen to anyone. He just played out Tony Greig, Geoff Arnold, Chris Old and Bob Willis. The reason he gave after the match was, 'I was facing these guys, practising against them for the Test matches in the future.'"There was turmoil in the dressing room. When our manager asked him, Gavaskar said, 'Leave me alone'," Ghavri added.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Leading the Meerut Mavericks against the Kanpur Superstars at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Stadium in Lucknow, Rinku struck with his very first delivery, sending the stumps flying and roaring in celebration. The part-time off-spinner, who has been under the radar of selectors ahead of the Asia Cup 2025, clean bowled Kanpur opener Aadarsh Singh in the powerplay. The dismissal not only stunned the opposition and brought out a passionate celebration from the player. He pumped his fist, let out a roar and then was congratulated by his teammates.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Earlier in the evening, Meerut Mavericks had posted a formidable 225/2. After a quick start from Akshay Dubey (44 off 26) and Rituraj Sharma (60 off 36), it was Madhav Kaushik who stole the show. Walking in at No. 4, Kaushik blazed his way to an unbeaten 95 off just 31 balls, striking 10 fours and seven sixes at a staggering strike rate of 306. His fireworks ensured Meerut set Kanpur a daunting 226-run target. In reply, the Superstars never found momentum. Reduced to 13/3 inside the powerplay, they were eventually restricted to 139/9. Only three batters managed to reach double figures in what turned out to be a one-sided contest.PollWill Rinku Singh make it to the Asia Cup 2025 squad?Yes, his performance warrants itNo, he needs to do moreHard to call, there are many options The Mavericks sealed an emphatic 86-run victory, but it was Rinku’s first-ball strike and passionate celebration that stole the headlines.

The former France international's decade-long dispute with Lokomotiv Moscow led to the landmark decision, challenging FIFA's authority.  France's Lassana Diarra reacts during the international friendly soccer match between England and France at Wembley Stadium in London. (AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth,) EUPEN, Belgium - Lawyers for former France international Lassana Diarra said Monday he is claiming 65 million euros ($76 million) from FIFA and the Belgian soccer federation after a landmark legal win about transfer rules. Diarra's decade-long challenge to FIFA after a breakdown in relations with his former club Lokomotiv Moscow led to a ruling at the European Union's top court last October that some aspects of soccer's transfer rules do not comply with the 27-nation bloc's labor and competition laws.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Lawyers for the 40-year-old former Chelsea, Arsenal and Real Madrid midfielder cited "unsuccessful settlement negotiations with FIFA" for the financial claim for damages throughout his career. "Lassana Diarra is claiming 65 million gross (35 million net) in compensation from FIFA and the Belgian Football Association," his legal firm Dupont Hissel said in a statement. FIFA was approached for comment about the latest high-stakes legal challenge to its authority.  Diarra's case, which is back in court in Belgium, is supported by the global players' union FIFPRO, its European division and their national member union in France. The legal case started in the home country of Charleroi, the Belgian club that wanted to sign Diarra after his contract in Moscow was terminated. FIFA transfer rules at the time made the player and the potential signing club liable for paying the former club when a contract was ruled to have been broken without "just cause." The Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld FIFA's ruling in favor of Lokomotiv. The case was sent to the European court which said the FIFA rules "hinder the free movement of players and competition between clubs." Diarra's dispute with Lokomotiv and FIFA forced him to miss the 2014-15 season. He then signed for Marseille and ended his career at Paris Saint-Germain six years ago. "I am doing this for myself," Diarra said in a statement Monday published by his lawyers. "And if I have been able to hold out against the FIFA steamroller, it is because I had a good career." "But I have also done it for all the up and coming, lesser known players who do not have the financial and psychological means to challenge FIFA before real judges," he said. Diarra's lawyers also are working on a class action suit filed this month against FIFA and some national soccer federations in Europe which claims could benefit 100,000 players over more than two decades.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Inspired by Moeen Ali, Bashir used the carrom ball, the same delivery he used to dismiss Siraj in the second Test at Edgbaston, to achieve the decisive breakthrough. Despite a finger injury, Bashir contributed with the bat, adding crucial runs. Getty Images NEW DELHI: Off-spinner Shoaib Bashir says the joy of dismissing India’s Mohammed Siraj to seal the Lord’s Test win for England will stay with him "forever." The 21-year-old also credited former teammate Moeen Ali for inspiring him to use the carrom ball, the delivery that ultimately brought him success. Bashir, who fractured his little finger at Lord’s and was ruled out of the remainder of the five-Test series, had already dismissed Siraj with the carrom ball in the second Test at Edgbaston.With Ravindra Jadeja (61 not out) threatening to take India home at Lord’s, captain Ben Stokes turned to Bashir for the breakthrough. Despite bowling with his left hand heavily strapped, the youngster delivered, removing Siraj with a ball that bounced and spun sharply.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"I met Moeen Ali for the first time at Edgbaston and we spoke a lot," Bashir told The Sunday Times. "Mo encouraged me to bowl the carrom ball. He's someone I've always looked up to and for him to say, 'Back yourself to do it,' meant a lot."Bashir revealed he had been working on the variation for a while but only gained confidence to use it after Moeen joined England’s training camp."I just wanted to show that I’ve got that strength in me. I bowled it a few times and it came out nicely. I got Siraj out with it (stumped in the first innings), with a really slow ball -- it was only about 43 to 44mph."Since Edgbaston, I’ve been in touch with Mo a fair few times. He's a legend and someone I look up to massively, especially being an off spinner in England, which is not an easy job," he added.Chasing 193, India slipped to 112/8 before Jadeja steadied them with partnerships alongside Jasprit Bumrah (5 off 54) and Siraj. Siraj resisted 29 balls before Bashir produced the decisive strike. The delivery spun back after being played onto the pitch and crashed into the base of Siraj’s leg stump, sparking wild England celebrations."We were creating chances, but just couldn’t get that wicket. I really wanted to get out there. Stokesy knew and gave me the go-ahead when he was on the field and I was on the bench. My left hand felt pretty good when I was bowling. I’m just glad I could make a difference."We got Joe Root to come into silly point to put pressure on Siraj, and I just tried to put as many revs on that ball as I could. Luckily it popped from a length and when it hit his bat (and down into the ground), everyone was just looking, ‘Where is it?’”Bashir said the moment is etched in his memory."From my angle I couldn’t really see (the bail coming off). My reaction was off a lot of other peoples’ reaction. I was just relieved. That feeling will stay with me forever -- at the home of cricket in front of a packed crowd. It doesn’t get better."Inside Lord's: Exclusive Stadium Tour & Must-Do ExperiencesThe spinner had injured his non-bowling hand earlier while trying to take a return catch off Jadeja in India’s first innings. He later underwent surgery, with two pins inserted in his finger, and remains under medical observation five weeks on.Despite the pain, he still contributed with the bat, scoring two off nine balls in a gritty seven-run stand with Jofra Archer that helped England stretch their lead in a match they eventually won by 22 runs."It (the injury) happened, I came off the field and went for a scan,” he recalled. “I knew it was pretty bad at that point, but I had plenty of pain-killers. There was no real conversation about me batting."My first ball from (Jasprit) Bumrah was a bouncer and the next ball a yorker, and it was one of those where the vibrations went right up through your hands. But I was always going to bat, even if it was only to add five-to-ten runs. In the grand scheme of things, they might matter."Bashir missed the rest of the series as India fought back to level it 2-2. His replacement, Liam Dawson, went wicketless across 47 overs at Old Trafford as India batted out a draw at 427/6 declared."It looked like the wicket flattened out and not much was happening. Even the Indian spinners struggled," said Bashir, who finished the series with 10 wickets at 54.1.Among Indian spinners, Jadeja picked up seven wickets at 72.4 while Washington Sundar claimed seven at 38.6."It was an incredible series to be part of. I learnt a lot playing against some of the best players in the world. I was quite happy with my performances," Bashir added.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Pathan also praises selector Ajit Agarkar's balanced approach and highlights the importance of coach-selector alignment in decision-making for fostering a merit-based environment. This shift aims to define a new era for Indian cricket. LONDON, ENGLAND - AUGUST 04: India coach Gautam Gambhir with Mohammed Siraj of India after the end of the match on day five of the 5th Rothesay Test Match at The Kia Oval on August 04, 2025 in London, England. (Photo by Gareth Copley/Getty Images) Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has thrown his weight behind head coach Gautam Gambhir, praising him for prioritising “team culture” over “star culture” in Indian cricket. Speaking candidly, Pathan highlighted how long-standing favoritism towards established names had often hurt promising players, and suggested that Gambhir, alongside chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar, is determined to bring lasting change in Indian cricket.“Mere liye team culture bahut important hai. (For me, team culture is very important). Gautam Gambhir jo hai na wahaan pe, jab tak wo apni coaching journey khatam karenge na, wo team culture le ke aayenge puri tarah se. (As long as Gambhir is the coach, he will fully instill team culture),” Pathan told Lallantop.Gautam Gambhir's fiery press conferences: Every time the India head coach lost his coolGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!The former left-arm pacer also spoke on how Indian cricket has, at times, been reluctant to move on from struggling players due to their past reputation. “Humare yahaan ek banda fail hue ja raha hai 3, 4, 5 saal se magar usko chance de do kyunki wo bahut bada player hai. Kahi toh aapko full stop lagana padega na. (Here, a player keeps failing for 3, 4, 5 years, but still gets opportunities because he is a big name. Somewhere, you have to put a full stop),” he explained.Pathan praised the current selection panel, led by Agarkar, for their balanced approach in picking teams. “Dusra jinka naam nahi aata, wo banda abada jabardast hai Indian cricket ke liye — chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar. (The other person who deserves credit is Ajit Agarkar, he is fantastic for Indian cricket),” Pathan said.PollDo you agree with Irfan Pathan's view that team culture is more important than star culture in cricket?Strongly AgreeAgreeDisagreeStrongly DisagreeHighlighting the decision-making process, Pathan stressed the importance of alignment between coach and selectors. “Aaj ek koi bhi decision hota hai na, wo sirf coach nahi le sakta, ek koi bhi decision selector nahi le sakta. Do log agar mil jaaye, jo majboot ho wo fir sahi direction mey jaate hai. Mujhe lagta hai ye dono sahi direction me ja rahe hai... team culture ko le kar. (Today, no decision can be taken solely by the coach or solely by the selector. If two strong individuals come together, the team moves in the right direction. I believe Gambhir and Agarkar are doing that with team culture),” he added.Pathan’s words reflect growing support for Gambhir’s philosophy of reducing individual favoritism and ensuring merit-based opportunities — a shift that could define the next era of Indian cricket.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Babar Azam and Mike Hesson (Images via Getty Images) Pakstan coach Mike Hesson has hinted that Babar Azam’s path back into the national T20I side could run through Australia’s Big Bash League later this year. The 30-year-old has been sidelined from the shortest format since late 2024, with selectors leaving him out of both the upcoming tri-series against UAE and Afghanistan and next month’s Asia Cup.'Perform in BBL': PAK coach Mike Hesson explains how Babar Azam can return to T20I squad after Asia Cup snub Hesson made it clear that while Babar remains a top-quality player, he needs to show progress in specific areas before reclaiming his spot. “There is no doubt Babar’s been asked to improve in some areas around taking on spin and in terms of his strike rate. Those are things he is working really hard on,” the coach said as quoted by the ICC.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Babar’s recent form has been inconsistent. He struck 47 in the first ODI against West Indies in Trinidad but followed it with scores of 0 and 9. His T20 record last year, of 738 runs in 24 matches at strike rates of 129.22 and 133.21, invited criticism for not being quick enough in a format where acceleration is crucial. Hesson suggested that Babar’s best chance to make a statement will come in December and January, when he is expected to feature in the BBL. “A player like Babar has an opportunity to play in the BBL and show he is improving in those areas in T20s. He is too good a player not to consider,” Hesson said. The coach also explained why others had been preferred in the current squad. “At the moment the players we have, have done exceptionally well. Sahibzada Farhan has played six games (against Bangladesh and West Indies) and won three Player of the Match awards,” he pointed out. Mohammad Rizwan’s exclusion was another notable call, with selectors opting to back batters who consistently score at a high strike rate.PollWhat do you believe is the main reason for Babar Azam's exclusion from the T20I side?Inconsistent performanceOther players performing better Hesson stressed the importance of rewarding recent form. “We need a run rate that puts us ahead of the game.

Pathan believes Chappell's intent was positive but his failure to adapt to Indian culture ultimately hindered his success, a crucial lesson in coaching. Irfan Pathan and Greg Chappell (Getty Images)  NEW DELHI: Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has opened up on Greg Chappell’s controversial stint as Team India’s head coach, offering a balanced view of the Australian’s methods. Pathan admitted that he personally benefited under Chappell, but also highlighted how the coach’s aggressive approach clashed with Indian cricketing culture, eventually contributing to a turbulent phase that included Sourav Ganguly’s removal as captain and India’s early exit from the 2007 ODI World Cup.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Pathan recalled how Chappell’s style created insecurity within the squad."He had his way of treating seniors and juniors with the same respect. But in that, he would be a bit more aggressive than one would like. He would tell anyone that if they don't perform, they will be dropped. I realised it was too aggressive, and once I talked to him privately about it," Pathan said on The Lallantop.IRFAN PATHAN FLYING FROM MUMBAI SPOTTED AT AIRPORT"I told him that we already know what you keep saying about being dropped. You don't need to tell us. It is causing insecurity in the team. He looked at me for a while, got a bit upset and threw some choicest of words, but then he realised I was right," he added.Pathan stressed that Chappell’s failure was not in intent but in cultural adaptation."If I go to Bangladesh or Sri Lanka or England as a coach, and if I don't accept their culture, would their players accept me? Greg Chappell's intention was right, but he wanted to bring an Australian culture. He wanted us to play hard cricket and didn't care what background anyone came from. But you can certainly do it in a much better way."Sharing his own county cricket experience, Pathan underlined why blending into a team’s environment is crucial."I played for Middlesex County club. You play a four-day match, then you drive the next day. They gather everyone in a bar before the match. I don't drink, but I need to accept their culture. You are a part of the team, and you need to blend in. If Chappell hadn't missed that one thing, he would've been one of the best coaches," he concluded.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

This allows a shift in gears for the format. The focus is on identifying impactful players who can perform consistently under pressure, with IPL performances heavily influencing selection decisions. Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson (BCCI Photo) NEW DELHI: The Indian selectors are scheduled to choose the team for next month’s Asia Cup on Tuesday. Over the past twelve months, India’s T20 team had been largely forgotten as Test cricket remained in the spotlight and the ODI format became a priority briefly because of the ICC Champions Trophy. However, the focus is now firmly on T20 cricket ahead of the T20 World Cup to be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka in Feb and March.

Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!The process is similar to when they selected the team for the previous T20 World Cup in 2024. With the IPL expanding each year, India’s pool of players has seen huge growth. As debates continue over who should be included in India’s T20 squad travelling to the UAE in the first week of Sept, the IPL’s role in developing a strong pool of T20 players cannot be overlooked. In 2021, the BCCI made a notable statement by confidently fielding a white-ball team in Sri Lanka despite 18 cricketers being in England for a Test series. Currently, social media platforms often feature pages listing multiple playing XIs in T20s. Impact of scouts in leagues A review of the current pool of players reveals that prominent names were discovered by IPL teams. The emergence of Hardik Pandya, Jasprit Bumrah and Sanju Samson dates back to over a decade. Varun Chakravarthy is perhaps the top example of intensive scouting. Tilak Varma and Abhishek Sharma’s rapid rise highlights how IPL franchises supported them despite modest domestic performances. The scouting teams of IPL franchises reach areas where the BCCI’s regular selectors may find it difficult. Tanmay Shrivastava, who was part of Virat Kohli’s U-19 World Cup-winning team in 2008, is now retired and has served as a scout for Royal Challengers Bengaluru before becoming an umpire. “Network building is a huge part of the exercise. There are franchises who rely on match referees, umpires and curators for tip-offs. As scouts, we formed groups and spread out all over the country. We tried to cover every tournament,” Shrivastava told TOI. Each state association starting its own T20 league has added further depth. Priyansh Arya, Digvesh Rathi and Aniket Verma exemplify this. Selectors adopting the change in mindset Paras Mhambrey, who served BCCI as a bowling coach for developmental teams and the senior India team before rejoining Mumbai Indians last year, acknowledged that the selection process has evolved, attributing significant influence to the IPL. “Impact” is now the most crucial factor in evaluating a player, aligning with coach Gautam Gambhir’s perspective on the format. Former India opener Devang Gandhi, a member of the selection committee that first chose T Natarajan and Varun for India’s 2020-21 tour of Australia, warned against mixing formats. “Hardik and Bumrah were picked for the 2016 T20 World Cup by the selection committee before us. When we picked Natarajan and Varun, it was done purely looking at them as T20 specialists. We refer to IPL performances. A mystery spinner takes time to be picked by the opponents. Consistency in IPL gives enough idea about their temperament. Formats should not be mixed. With batters, you want to see them perform a little longer in various domestic tournaments,” Gandhi told TOI. A member of the previous selection committee, who wished to remain anonymous, agreed that Chakravarthy was selected based on his novelty. When Pandya’s bowling and fitness declined in 2021-22, the selectors opted for Venkatesh Iyer, who was discovered in the IPL in UAE. The selector noted that IPL has made maintaining a strong pool considerably easier. “For T20s, you don’t have to look too much into domestic records over a period of time. It’s about making impact consistently,” the selector said. The intense competition in India’s T20 scene has led selectors to focus more on rejection than selection. The omission of Shubman Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rinku Singh for the T20 World Cup that India won in 2024 sparked debate. They remain subjects of discussion as the next edition of the tournament gets closer. Former India wicketkeeper Vijay Dahiya, who has worked with KKR, DC and LSG, says, “When we picked Ayush Badoni and Mayank Yadav out of the blue for LSG in 2022, we looked at their potential to be international cricketers, but immediate IPL impact was at the forefront. Form in T20 cricket is often judged on recent performances. Over time, you get to see the hunger of a player. Chakravarthy is a prime example. He was discovered when he made his T20I debut. He went back and worked on his game to make a comeback. India has a sizeable database through IPL to separate modern-day T20 players. So, it’s still about selection,” Dahiya said. The IPL has provided a vast array of talent for selectors. The outcome will depend on how they form a balanced and impressive teamCatch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
