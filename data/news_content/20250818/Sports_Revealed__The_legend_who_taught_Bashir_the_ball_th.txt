Getty Images NEW DELHI: Off-spinner Shoaib Bashir says the joy of dismissing India’s Mohammed Siraj to seal the Lord’s Test win for England will stay with him "forever." The 21-year-old also credited former teammate Moeen Ali for inspiring him to use the carrom ball, the delivery that ultimately brought him success. Bashir, who fractured his little finger at Lord’s and was ruled out of the remainder of the five-Test series, had already dismissed Siraj with the carrom ball in the second Test at Edgbaston.With Ravindra Jadeja (61 not out) threatening to take India home at Lord’s, captain Ben Stokes turned to Bashir for the breakthrough. Despite bowling with his left hand heavily strapped, the youngster delivered, removing Siraj with a ball that bounced and spun sharply.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"I met Moeen Ali for the first time at Edgbaston and we spoke a lot," Bashir told The Sunday Times. "Mo encouraged me to bowl the carrom ball. He's someone I've always looked up to and for him to say, 'Back yourself to do it,' meant a lot."Bashir revealed he had been working on the variation for a while but only gained confidence to use it after Moeen joined England’s training camp."I just wanted to show that I’ve got that strength in me. I bowled it a few times and it came out nicely. I got Siraj out with it (stumped in the first innings), with a really slow ball -- it was only about 43 to 44mph."Since Edgbaston, I’ve been in touch with Mo a fair few times. He's a legend and someone I look up to massively, especially being an off spinner in England, which is not an easy job," he added.Chasing 193, India slipped to 112/8 before Jadeja steadied them with partnerships alongside Jasprit Bumrah (5 off 54) and Siraj. Siraj resisted 29 balls before Bashir produced the decisive strike. The delivery spun back after being played onto the pitch and crashed into the base of Siraj’s leg stump, sparking wild England celebrations."We were creating chances, but just couldn’t get that wicket. I really wanted to get out there. Stokesy knew and gave me the go-ahead when he was on the field and I was on the bench. My left hand felt pretty good when I was bowling. I’m just glad I could make a difference."We got Joe Root to come into silly point to put pressure on Siraj, and I just tried to put as many revs on that ball as I could. Luckily it popped from a length and when it hit his bat (and down into the ground), everyone was just looking, ‘Where is it?’”Bashir said the moment is etched in his memory."From my angle I couldn’t really see (the bail coming off). My reaction was off a lot of other peoples’ reaction. I was just relieved. That feeling will stay with me forever -- at the home of cricket in front of a packed crowd. It doesn’t get better."Inside Lord's: Exclusive Stadium Tour & Must-Do ExperiencesThe spinner had injured his non-bowling hand earlier while trying to take a return catch off Jadeja in India’s first innings. He later underwent surgery, with two pins inserted in his finger, and remains under medical observation five weeks on.Despite the pain, he still contributed with the bat, scoring two off nine balls in a gritty seven-run stand with Jofra Archer that helped England stretch their lead in a match they eventually won by 22 runs."It (the injury) happened, I came off the field and went for a scan,” he recalled. “I knew it was pretty bad at that point, but I had plenty of pain-killers. There was no real conversation about me batting."My first ball from (Jasprit) Bumrah was a bouncer and the next ball a yorker, and it was one of those where the vibrations went right up through your hands. But I was always going to bat, even if it was only to add five-to-ten runs. In the grand scheme of things, they might matter."Bashir missed the rest of the series as India fought back to level it 2-2. His replacement, Liam Dawson, went wicketless across 47 overs at Old Trafford as India batted out a draw at 427/6 declared."It looked like the wicket flattened out and not much was happening. Even the Indian spinners struggled," said Bashir, who finished the series with 10 wickets at 54.1.Among Indian spinners, Jadeja picked up seven wickets at 72.4 while Washington Sundar claimed seven at 38.6."It was an incredible series to be part of. I learnt a lot playing against some of the best players in the world. I was quite happy with my performances," Bashir added.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
