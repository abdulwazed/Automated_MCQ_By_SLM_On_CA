The Association underscored that legal steps will be taken against any party undermining match officials, marking a decisive move to safeguard the integrity of Emirati referees.UAEFA takes a stand on referee criticismThe UAE Football Association (UAEFA) released a sharply worded statement warning clubs against challenging the competence or impartiality of match officials. The move follows comments made by Al Ain Football Club after their 2-1 win over Al Bataeh in the opening round of the 2024-25 ADNOC Pro League.According to the Association, any inappropriate public criticism of referees will lead to legal consequences. It emphasized that the authority for developing and overseeing the refereeing system lies solely with UAEFA and is managed through specialized committees and qualified professionals operating within structured frameworks.The statement also referenced a pattern of administrative missteps by Al Ain over the past two seasons. UAEFA said these were previously addressed with professionalism but added that it expects the club to focus on improving its internal processes and refrain from involving itself in areas outside its purview.Al Ain’s post match remarks spark controversyThe controversy began after Al Ain’s head coach, Vladimir Ivić, expressed frustration with the match officiating during his post-match press conference. The Serbian coach stated that his team had scored five times, with three goals disallowed. “For the first time in my career, I saw my team score five goals but the final result was 2-1. We definitely deserved more,” he said.The club also issued an official comment on its platforms, referring to “numerous controversial refereeing incidents” in the game. While affirming support for the domestic refereeing system, the club stated it “firmly rejects the continued occurrence of mistakes that could negatively affect the team’s results in domestic competitions.”In response, UAEFA criticized the tone and content of Al Ain's statements, highlighting the need for all clubs to uphold sportsmanship and show respect for the work of others in the football ecosystem.Legal consequences and available alternativesThe Association confirmed that legal action will be initiated against Al Ain FC and any other individual or entity that publicly undermines match officials. It reiterated that complaints about officiating must be handled through formal channels, not public statements.As an alternative for clubs dissatisfied with domestic referees, UAEFA noted that there is an established mechanism for requesting foreign match officials. This provision, however, must be used through the proper channels and approvals.Match highlights and milestones from Al Ain vs Al BataehOn the field, the match itself was notable beyond the controversy. Togolese striker Kodjo Fo-Doh Laba scored during first-half stoppage time, registering the 9,000th goal in ADNOC Pro League history — a significant milestone for the competition.Al Bataeh responded in the 69th minute with an equalizer from Uzbekistan international Azizjon Ganiev. However, Al Ain sealed their opening victory in the 82nd minute with a decisive header from Abdoul Karim Traoré.The match also marked the debut of Al Ain’s newly installed integrated cooling system at Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium. Over 300 air-conditioning units were operational to enhance fan comfort amid the UAE’s intense summer temperatures. Despite the off-field tensions, fans turned out in large numbers, with long queues at food outlets reflecting the growing attendance and engagement at league games.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
