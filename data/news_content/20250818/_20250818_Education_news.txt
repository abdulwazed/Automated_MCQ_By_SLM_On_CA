“At your age, I was earning much less — you should be happy with what you’re getting,” says Indian manager: Does the Indian scarcity mindset clash with US office norms?
A Reddit post revealed how an Indian manager told an employee, “At your age, I earned less — be happy with your pay.” The incident sparked debate on whether India’s scarcity mindset, shaped by hierarchy and competition, clashes with US workplace norms.

While cultural influences play a role, experts stress that toxic management styles aren’t ethnic traits but universal flaws.  A Reddit post recently sparked attention when an employee recounted asking their Indian manager for a raise — only to be told, ‘At your age, I was earning much less — you should be happy with what you’re getting.’ The remark was far from a casual aside; it triggered a broader conversation about whether certain managerial practices of Indians in US workplaces could negatively affect employees.From terse interview exchanges to subtle, everyday biases, employees depicted managers whose conduct weighed heavily on overall workplace morale and engagement. “It’s honestly exhausting to deal with managers like this. Instead of building people up, they drag everyone down with their bitterness and toxic mindset,” the same user reflected.The discussion thread quickly swelled with narratives underscoring experiences of authority, personal insecurities, and generational conditioning. For many, it posed a pressing question: Are these behaviors isolated incidents, or do they indicate a recurring style that can leave employees drained?Not one manager, but many: Why toxic patterns keep repeating at workSeveral Reddit users recounted experiences hinting at systemic patterns rather than singular occurrences. One described an interview in which a manager dismissed their answer as “the worst I have ever heard” and asked them to reconsider it, only to subsequently extend a job offer.Another user highlighted a dissonance between seniority and compensation: “If you are older, he'll tell you — you are very senior — you are expected to perform at a senior level, while paying you a junior-level salary.”These testimonies suggest repeated behaviors that employees found frustrating and taxing, leaving a lasting impact on workplace dynamics and overall employee wellbeing. Yet, looking at these anecdotes as mere oddities would be a mistake. They map onto what one repeatedly hears in corporate hallways — a style of management that prizes control over collaboration, hierarchy over mentorship.Cultural and historical influences on managementSome linked these behaviors to cultural and historical influences. While the notion of a “scarcity mindset” has been discussed online, many emphasized that managerial conduct can be shaped by a complex blend of upbringing, competitive pressures, and hierarchical norms.One Reddit user wrote, “The roots of bad middle management are in the scarcity mindset that gets embedded in all Indians when you grow up in India. Makes you see the world as a zero-sum game — someone needs to lose in order for someone else to win.”This mindset emerges from growing up in environments where resources and opportunities were limited, and advancement often required outcompeting others. It can foster a heightened sense of risk aversion, a protective approach to personal gains, and a belief that for someone to succeed, another must lose — attitudes that, when carried into workplaces, can influence managerial decisions and employee interactions.Culture clash or common flaw? Why it’s not just about Indian managersAttributing this behaviour purely to cultural conditioning risks missing another point: Indian managers in multinational workplaces often straddle two worlds. On the one hand, they inherit habits of caution, deference to hierarchy, and scepticism born of scarcity. On the other, they face Western corporate cultures that reward openness, flat structures, and recognition. The friction between the two can produce managerial habits that appear abrasive, defensive, or excessively controlling to employees.Several Redditors cautioned against broad generalizations. “You are exhibiting the same mentality then. You are typecasting all Indians in the same bracket. And that’s wrong,” one remarked. Another added, “I’ve had managers considered as typical Americans make similar comments. This is not about race or ethnicity but about this manager. Stop stereotyping entire communities.”Insecure or dismissive managerial styles are not confined to any single culture. It is worth remembering that while some patterns may reflect cultural residue, others are universal human failings — insecurity, fear of being outshone, or reluctance to share credit. When those traits coincide with cultural baggage, the outcome feels amplified. That is why generalisations, tempting as they are, flatten nuance and unfairly paint every Indian manager with the same brush.The key lies in identifying patterns that may affect employee engagement and wellbeing without resorting to sweeping assumptions, while establishing frameworks that promote accountability, constructive feedback, and sustainable mentorship.Bottom line: Bad management isn’t an ethnic traitThese narratives, while anecdotal, illuminate the complexities of workplace dynamics under Indian managers in US offices. For employees, the stories underscore the importance of navigating managerial interactions with awareness while advocating for fairness, transparency, and support. For organizations, they highlight the need to foster leadership that balances experience with empathy, and authority with mentorship.If there is a lesson in these stories, it is this: Bad management is not an ethnic trait, but when cultural habits meet unchecked authority, the outcome can feel distinctly patterned. Recognising this — without caricaturing — is the first step toward healthier workplaces.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now. Follow us here.Ready to navigate global policies?

Google vs Meta: How two tech giants are betting differently on AI and the future of hiring
Google and Meta are taking opposite paths on AI in hiring. Google is reinstating in-person interviews to curb AI cheating and preserve candidate integrity, while Meta is piloting AI-assisted interviews, viewing collaboration with AI as the future skill. This divergence highlights a larger debate: Should hiring reward independent fundamentals or the ability to co-create with AI?

Google is reinstating in-person interviews to curb AI cheating and preserve candidate integrity, while Meta is piloting AI-assisted interviews, viewing collaboration with AI as the future skill. This divergence highlights a larger debate: Should hiring reward independent fundamentals or the ability to co-create with AI?  When it comes to hiring in tech, Google and Meta are moving in two very different directions, and the divergence could shape the future of work in Silicon Valley. While one company is tightening control over in-person assessments, the other is experimenting with AI as an active partner in interviews. Both moves reflect how artificial intelligence is redefining not just workflows but the very rules of evaluation.The urgency behind these shifts is clear: AI-powered cheating tools have made virtual interviews increasingly unreliable. Candidates are now able to use off-camera assistants to solve coding challenges in real time, blurring the line between genuine skill and AI support. For recruiters, this has turned remote hiring into a minefield, forcing companies like Google and Meta to rethink how they evaluate technical talent in an era dominated by AI.Google brings back in-person interviews For Google, the answer to AI-powered cheating is simple: Bring back face-to-face interactions. CEO Sundar Pichai announced on the Lex Fridman podcast in June that the company would introduce at least one round of in-person interviews to ensure candidates have the necessary fundamentals, according to the podcast. The problem has grown urgent. Software engineering interviews at Google, which rely on real-time coding challenges, have increasingly been compromised by off-camera AI assistance. During a February internal town hall meeting, employees pressed leadership to abandon remote interviews entirely. “Can we get onsite job interviews back?” one employee asked, according to audio recordings reviewed by CNBC. “There are many email threads about this topic. If budget is a constraint, can we get the candidates to an office or environment we can control?”. Brian Ong, Google’s Vice President of Recruiting, admitted that while virtual interviews are faster and easier to schedule, the company faces a fundamental challenge. According to CNBC, he acknowledged, “we definitely have more work to do to integrate how AI is now more prevalent in the interview process.” Some hiring managers report that over 50% of candidates are now cheating during technical interviews, forcing interviewers to probe extensively to assess real understanding, according to CNBC. Pichai’s response is a hybrid approach: A mix of virtual and in-person rounds. “Given we all work hybrid, I think it's worth thinking about some fraction of the interviews being in person. I think it'll help both the candidates understand Google's culture and I think it's good for both sides,” he said on the Lex Fridman podcast. The move signals a sharp reversal from pandemic-era hiring practices. As Ong noted to CNBC, Google isn’t alone in tackling this challenge. Competitor companies are grappling with the same problem, with AI increasingly complicating remote assessments.Industry-wide caution: Anti-cheating measures everywhere Other tech players are also reacting. According to CNBC, Anthropic, the maker of AI chatbot Claude, now explicitly prohibits AI use during applications, requiring candidates to demonstrate “non-AI-assisted communication skills.” Amazon has also begun requiring candidates to acknowledge they won’t use unauthorized tools during interviews. Cisco and McKinsey are also among companies bringing back face-to-face meetings at various stages, while Deloitte has reinstated in-person interviews for its UK graduate program, according to CNBC. For Google, the message is clear: Convenience cannot come at the cost of integrity.Meta takes the opposite path Meanwhile, Meta is exploring a very different approach. According to 404 Media, the company is actively testing AI-enabled interviews where coding candidates can use an artificial intelligence assistant during assessments. An internal memo titled “AI-Enabled Interviews—Call for Mock Candidates” invited employees to participate in mock interviews using AI support, reflecting the “developer environment that our future employees will work in”. A Meta spokesperson told 404 Media, “We’re obviously focused on using AI to help engineers with their day-to-day work, so it should be no surprise that we’re testing how to provide these tools to applicants during interviews”. The company is signaling that collaboration with AI may soon be an expected skill, not an unfair advantage. This aligns with CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s vision. According to the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, he stated that AI agents would soon function as “midlevel engineers” capable of writing code. “Over time,” he added, “we’ll get to a point where a lot of the code in our apps is actually going to be built by AI engineers instead of people engineers”.The Cluely case: A glimpse into the future The concept isn’t purely theoretical. Chungin “Roy” Lee, a Columbia University computer science student, created Interview Coder in early 2024—an AI tool that discreetly assisted candidates during coding interviews. Columbia suspended Lee for a year for violating academic integrity, according to Associated Press, but he later moved to San Francisco, rebranded the product as Cluely, and built it into a stealth-mode AI assistant used in interviews, exams, and meetings. By mid-2025, Cluely had raised over $20 million, including a $15 million Series A led by Andreessen Horowitz. Lee’s defiance is telling. According to Associated Press, he said, “Everyone uses AI now. It doesn't make sense to have systems that test people as if they don't.” Meta’s recent pilot suggests a shift in corporate thinking — from penalizing AI use to building evaluation frameworks around it.What it means for candidates The divergence between Google and Meta points to a broader debate: Should interviews measure raw individual skill, or should they test the ability to collaborate with AI? In Google’s world, fundamentals and independent problem-solving are non-negotiable. At Meta, the ability to co-create with AI may soon become the baseline. For aspiring tech professionals, the message is clear. Understanding AI won’t just be a bonus, it could define employability in the coming years. TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

However, in other regions, schools may function as usual, depending on state directives. With Onam and other festivals also lined up, August has emerged as a month filled with holidays for students.  August continues to be a packed month for students across India, blending academic deadlines with national festivals and state-specific observances. As schools navigate through Independence Day activities and mid-term preparations, another question looms large: Will August 27, the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, bring a school holiday?Ganesh Chaturthi and regional school closuresGanesh Chaturthi, which falls on Wednesday, August 27, 2025, is one of the most widely celebrated festivals in western and southern India. The day marks the birth of Lord Ganesha and is observed with grand processions, pujas, and community celebrations. It is also recognised as a public holiday in states such as Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, and Telangana, where schools might remain closed to allow students and families to participate.In other regions, the holiday status depends on government notifications or school board directives. States where Ganesh Chaturthi is not traditionally observed may continue with regular academic schedules.August 2025: A festive month for studentsThis year, August has brought a cluster of holidays. Independence Day on August 15 was observed nationwide, while Raksha Bandhan (August 9) and Janmashtami (August 16) were regional holidays. Schools in Kerala are also set to close during Onam celebrations from August 26 to 28, coinciding with Ganesh Chaturthi.For students and parents, these holidays not only provide cultural immersion but also offer a pause in busy academic calendars. Whether schools will remain closed on August 27 depends largely on regional observance and state-level announcements.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future.

Non-engineers now almost equal to engineers in elite B-schools: What’s breaking the ‘engineering dominance’ in management?
India’s elite B-schools are witnessing a paradigm shift: engineers no longer dominate MBA classrooms. Non-engineers—economists, commerce graduates, and humanities students—are now matching or surpassing their peers in institutes like IIM Ahmedabad, Lucknow, and Indore. Changing corporate demands, revamped admission policies, and rising aspirations among non-engineers are driving this transformation, signaling the end of engineering monopoly in management education.

Non-engineers—economists, commerce graduates, and humanities students—are now matching or surpassing their peers in institutes like IIM Ahmedabad, Lucknow, and Indore. Changing corporate demands, revamped admission policies, and rising aspirations among non-engineers are driving this transformation, signaling the end of engineering monopoly in management education. Indian Institute of Management campus in Indore. Engineering and Management were often considered intertwined courses. Henceforth, the elite B-schools such as IIMs have long cherished the major footfall of engineers. The engineers reigned supreme in management classrooms for years; their numerical dominance was entrenched in the system, and non-engineers often seemed like outliers. However, the picture is changing now. The monopoly of engineers on management schools is breaking. Today’s classrooms are seeing a surge in the participation of economists, accountants, and students hailing from commerce and humanities backgrounds. Their strengths are rising and nearly matching their engineering peers in elite MBA programmes. The statistics are unambiguous. At IIM-Indore, non-engineers now account for 55% of the 2025–27 batch. IIM-Lucknow follows with just under 53%, and IIM-Ahmedabad has reached 50%, up sharply from 33% in just three years, the TNN reports suggest.While numbers depict the situation, the question that arises is: What factors are leading to a change in history and shattering the stronghold of engineering dominance?The anatomy of changeThe rise of non-engineers in India’s premier B-schools is not a coincidence; it is the result of deep structural shifts both in the pipeline of applicants and in the demands of management education.Corporate demand for new skill setsThe 21st-century corporate world is not simply asking for number-crunchers; it wants managers who can communicate, collaborate, and create. Recruiters increasingly value critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and creativity, areas where non-engineers, trained in economics, commerce, and the humanities, often hold a natural edge.With the rise of the demands of these skills, the non-engineers are flooding to B-schools to fill in the skill gap.Conscious academic design by B-schoolsIt is not a coincidence or an accident. The top B-schools have consciously and deliberately restructured their admission architecture to foster and promote diversity. At IIM-Ahmedabad, director Bharat Bhasker told TNN, “The institute began introducing academic categories about a decade ago to ensure diversity. An increase in applications from non-engineers has led to a healthy balance in classrooms.”The idea is clear: A classroom that reflects multiple academic backgrounds generates richer discussions and produces leaders who are versatile, not one-dimensional.Rising aspirations of non-engineersFor long, management was perceived as the “natural next step” for engineers. But today, students from commerce, economics, and arts are seeing B-schools as their own turf, not someone else’s. At IIM-Lucknow, for instance, 268 of 507 students in the latest MBA cohort come from non-engineering backgrounds. Director M.P. Gupta told TNN, “Commerce-related courses have attracted the most students.”The fact that commerce graduates are entering B-schools in record numbers shows a generational shift in how non-engineers view management as a career accelerator.Changing nature of business problemsWith the nature of work, the problems that businesses are facing are also altering their face. It is not solved by quantitative models alone. Whether it is managing global supply chain disruptions, navigating ESG mandates, or leading diverse teams, the need for soft skills, cultural literacy, and systems thinking is paramount. B-schools are, in effect, mirroring this reality in their selection processes.A gender dimensionThe rise of non-engineers also overlaps with the growing presence of women in B-schools. At IIM-Indore’s 2025–27 batch, of the 270 non-engineers admitted, 179 are women. Director of IIM Indore, Himanshu Rai said to TNN that, “At IIM-Indore, representation of non-engineers has risen steadily over five years.” Diversity in background is, in many cases, also translating into diversity in gender.The end of an era, and the dawn of balanceThis is not a data representation or mere statistics, but it implies toward major structural reordering of India’s B-schools. The engineering dominance in management classes is crumbling. It is getting substituted by a near-equal balance that brings forth pluralism and intellectual richness into classrooms.The engineer may no longer be the default face of India’s B-schools. The future belongs to a balanced mix, and therein lies the strength of the next generation of Indian management leaders.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future.

Studies reveal that 3D instruction enhances learning speed, attention and cognitive engagement. Integrating physical models, AR/VR, sketching and project-based learning can foster spatial reasoning, preparing students for complex, innovative careers by moving beyond surface-level understanding. Unlocking the power of 3D thinking in education: Enhancing spatial reasoning skills (Image: Pexels) Education is increasingly becoming digitised where content is delivered via screens and students are often left interacting with two-dimensional representations of complicated, three-dimensional realities. Although static images, videos and PDFs can provide fundamental information, they rarely capture the nuance, scale or spatial relationships that many subjects require. Encouraging students to “think in 3D” is more than a metaphor, it is an essential educational shift that enables students to engage with the real world more deeply, solve problems creatively and develop spatial awareness, a skill often overlooked in traditional classrooms.A 2011 independent study conducted by Texas Instruments showed that 3D instruction was not just faster but also led to greater attention and deeper cognitive engagement. The large-scale study was conducted across 15 schools by 47 teachers in Europe where students aged 10–13 were taught scientific concepts using either traditional 2D methods or immersive 3D visual aids. Professor Anne Bamford noted, “Across all of the schools involved in the study, 3D shortened the time it took for students to learn concepts, increased their attention spans and resulted in overall deeper thinking from the students.” However, the study noted potential downsides as well that included discomfort from prolonged 3D viewing and inaccessibility for students who are stereo-blind.What does "thinking in 3D" really mean?Thinking in 3D means mentally visualising, manipulating and understanding objects or ideas in a physical space. It is a critical component of fields such as:STEM disciplines: Visualising molecules in chemistry, anatomical structures in biology or force vectors in physics.Engineering and design: Drafting, prototyping and problem-solving.Architecture and urban planning: Imagining spatial relationships and human movement through built environments.Art and media: Constructing visual scenes, installations or cinematic framing.Beyond the technical aspects, 3D thinking enables students to break free from linear problem-solving and start seeing how systems interconnect in space and function. 3D thinking is not just for science and math. Spatial and multidimensional thinking can also benefit:History: Reconstructing ancient cities or exploring the movement of civilisations.Literature: Visualising narrative structure or mapping character relationships.Geography: Understanding topography, elevation and climate systems.The limits of textbooks and screensAre traditional educational methods failing students? The case for 3D thinking (Image: Pexels)A recent August 2025 study by Cornell University implemented a three-week VR course that was designed to teach spatial reasoning to undergraduate STEM students. In comparison to the traditional, more time-intensive pencil-and-paper methods, the VR approach delivered comparable gains in spatial ability and demonstrated VR's efficiency and potential as a learning tool. Additionally, students reported enjoyment and lower-than-typical cybersickness. Although textbooks and digital learning platforms are essential resources, which deliver flat content through diagrams, descriptions and formulas that help students memorise and recall, they often fail to help them understand concepts.Some key limitations include:Lack of scale: A student may know the solar system’s planets but not how vastly they differ in their sizes and distances.No tactile feedback: Manipulating objects physically strengthens memory and understanding.Linear pathways: Many digital resources lead students down one path, rather than allowing for exploration or perspective shifts.These constraints can lead to a surface-level understanding where students can recite facts but may struggle to apply them flexibly.Why spatial thinking matters in educationResearch shows a strong link between spatial reasoning and future success in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). A 2013 study published in Psychological Science found that early spatial skills can predict achievement in STEM fields better than math or verbal scores.Is 3D thinking the key to revolutionising education and spatial understanding? (Image: Pexels)Spatial thinking helps students visualise complicated systems or changes over time, understand physical cause and effect, solve problems from different angles and transfer knowledge between domains. Educators who emphasize spatial reasoning are not only helping students pass exams but also build minds that are ready for real-world innovation.Strategies for teaching 3D thinking1. Use Physical Models: Incorporate 3D models in science classes (e.g., the DNA helix, anatomy models) and let students build structures with blocks, clay, or 3D puzzles to explore form and function. It works because handling a DNA model, clay structure, or 3D puzzle activates sensory and motor pathways, making spatial relationships intuitive and memorable. Many studies root this strategy in embodied cognition, which emphasizes learning through physical interaction. For example, learning with manipulatives or objects that you can physically manipulate supports problem-solving and deeper cognitive processing. It aligns with theory and practice in embodied design, where tactile experiences facilitate understanding and exploration through gesture and motion. 2. Integrate Augmented and Virtual Reality: Use AR apps to place digital 3D models in the classroom and offer virtual tours for example, inside a volcano or around the International Space Station. AR enhances spatial learning and motivation or so Systematic Review of the Development of Spatial Intelligence through Augmented Reality in STEM Knowledge Areas, a systematic review of 17 STEM-focused studies, found. It established that AR significantly boosts understanding of visually complex content, learning outcomes (especially in areas like descriptive geometry and stereochemistry) and motivation and proactive engagement (particularly in students with lower baseline spatial skills).3. Encourage Drawing and Sketching: Make students draw systems from multiple angles for example, a plant’s root system or a cross-section of a heart as sketching enhances memory and spatial understanding. An engineering education study, The Role of Spatial Skills and Sketching in Engineering Design Problem Solving, found a strong positive correlation between students' spatial visualisation ability and the clarity of their freehand sketches. In other words, students with better spatial skills created superior drawings and vice versa. Hence, encouraging sketching of 3D systems from multiple angles helps students internalise spatial relationships visually and cognitively.4. Project-Based Learning: Ask students to design a bridge, map a city or build a simple machine to encourage real-world application and testing of their designs. The principles of embodied cognition and embodied design support the idea that hands-on building tasks engage deep spatial reasoning. Problem-solving with tangible tools links thinking to physical model manipulation, supporting metacognitive reflection on process and design.5. Teach Metacognitive Skills: Help students become aware of their own learning processes. Ask: “Can you picture it in your mind?” or “How would this look if we changed the scale?” According to research article, Fostering spatial abilities of middle school students through augmented reality: Spatial strategies, learners often develop and adapt their own spatial strategies when reflecting on tasks and this is evidence that metacognitive framing enhances spatial understanding. Hence, prompting students to visualise or mentally scale objects (“Can you picture it?”) nurtures awareness of spatial reasoning strategies and fosters flexible thinking.Teaching in 3D encourages students to go deeper and broader, returns learning to the senses and invites curiosity, exploration and creative failure. In a world saturated with fast, flat content, students who can think beyond the screen and can mentally walk around a problem, will be those who innovate. 3D thinking becomes an advantage and a necessity as we prepare students for careers that do not yet exist in industries defined by complexity and creativity. Let us move beyond surface-level engagement and help students see, touch, imagine and build their way into deeper understanding. Education must embrace dimensionality because real thinking, like the world itself, happens in more than two dimensions.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future.

Science suggests brief exposures alter learning, memory and knowledge application. A University of Sydney study shows even 5-minute breaks restore focus. Neuroscience indicates spaced repetition aids memory. Research confirms micro-breaks improve well-being and performance. Experts highlight micro-learning's efficiency; suggest intense study creates neural pathways. Here's the secret to learning anything faster in just 5 minutes (Image: iStock) In an era of short attention spans and an abundance of distractions, the notion of studying for hours on end seems outdated. In comes the idea of micro-learning: absorbing knowledge in five-minute segments. Although this may seem insignificant, science suggests those brief exposures can alter the way we learn, remember and apply knowledge.We picture learning as long, quiet hours hunched over a desk but science tells us another story. The brain does not grow in long marathon sessions — it grows best in small, quick bursts. Those small bursts of focussed effort repeated regularly can often accomplish more than an hour of distracted reading. This approach uses what psychologists refer to as 'micro-learning', a delivery method that makes knowledge available in small compartments. It operates like mental espresso — short, strong and re-energising. We learn more when we are alert and engaged and using a five-minute focused burst makes it much easier to own that focus.5 minutes a day could make you smarter than your classmates: Here’s howAccording to a 2023 study, 5-minute brain break: refresh your mind (anywhere) by University of Sydney, even a simple 5-minute “brain break” effectively restores focus and learning efficiency. In this study, students engaged in complex mental math to deplete attention. Afterwards, some either took a 5-minute unstructured rest, watched a short nature video or continued without a break. Those who rested, whether passively or virtually immersed in nature, demonstrated significantly better attention and outperformed the no‑rest group on subsequent problem-solving tasks.Study smarter, not longer: Neuroscience says this tiny habit works (Image: Pexels)Neuroscience suggests that our brains register information best when the learning is enacted with spacing and repetition. The hippocampus (the area of the brain responsible for memories) favours novelty and experiences that are brief and have focused engagement. When we use a five-minute burst to study, we are activating the brain's alertness system and synaptic activity without producing cognitive overload. Moreover, our experiences of consuming information for a long period produced diminishing returns, a lack of attention, and a poorer ability to memorise.In an interaction with TOI Education, Mamta Jani, Founder of Ontrack Education, explained, "Micro-moments take advantage of the optimum interval of focus, where every minute counts. Beyond effectiveness, micro-learning also capitalises on the natural curiosity rhythm of our brains. The moment the learner learns that they will only spend five minutes, all psychological resistance disappears, and the mind engages with the short ‘experiment’ rather than a fear-inducing task to accomplish. It can turn an uninteresting topic into a compelling challenge: 'I can look up quantum physics for five minutes,' or 'I can drill my vocabulary for five minutes,' or 'I can do a short programming task.' The transition from micro-moment to larger blocks of expertise is gradual but impactful—like the tiny raindrops that turn into a river."A research paper, "Give me a break!" A systematic review and meta-analysis on the efficacy of micro-breaks for increasing well-being and performance, evaluated short micro-breaks (< 10 min) across multiple tasks. Findings indicate:Well-being: Micro-breaks consistently preserve vigour and reduce fatigue.Performance: Especially beneficial for clerical or creative tasks, though results vary with task type. Longer breaks tended to offer greater performance gainsIt established that even brief pauses under 10 minutes reliably improve subjective energy and performance in many contexts.Forget all-nighters: This study hack takes less than a coffee breakMicro-moments, in addition to the other reasons for their effectiveness, get us to retrieval practice, which is a critical factor noted in cognitive science. When we review and test learning in less than set intervals, we activate memory pathways more effectively than through continuous reading or cramming for a long time before an exam. Different learning tools like apps, flashcards, or sticky notes can convert normal during-wait time periods— i.e., commuting, standing in a queue, or during a coffee break — into many different opportunities for the better use of these basic moments of the day. What starts as an insignificant value with a single micro-moment can grow into an effective learning process that is created and formed through habit, done multiple times during the day. As well, micro-learning makes sense with the structure and functioning of artificial intelligence.Jani elaborated, "Algorithms process information in highly rapid cycles to query and store data and recall it. In the same way, micro-learning supports cognitive development at the human level as it allows for processing specifications, data and tactical knowledge of critical, applied information in short, small bits of practical, actionable information. For this reason, and many more, micro-moments are both winner-winner and future-orientated. prepare our cognitive ability for a context that values agility and adaptability more than precise recall of information learnt verbatim. Lastly, there is a deep time element of integration and reflection associated with these microbursts. Instead of studying for five minutes in an isolated short duration, you may be prompted to ask questions, make connections, or have creative considerations that have been routinely lost in longer, more artificial sessions that are forced."Here's how to sneak learning into your day without even tryingThe micro-moment exercises have a value of fostering an orientation of curiosity and objective learning that is continuous, spontaneous, and free of obligations. Essentially, learning in micro-moments is the opposite of what we have been taught to expect: depth doesn't always have to require a period. A series of 5-minute activities allows us to take advantage of our brain's natural cycles, convert dead time into active engagement, and promote an ongoing curiosity throughout our lives. In a world of distractions, seeking small amounts of focused learning may be the most potent approach we can take.Boost your brainpower while boiling water, no jokeThe science lies in how memory forms. Bringing his expertise to the same, Manish Mohta, Founder of Learning Spiral, advised, "Short periods of intense study create fresh neural pathways without overloading them. These pathways strengthen during rest intervals, meaning that the real learning takes place after the study has finished. Learning often occurs best after an intense five-minute session and resting or changing activity. The brain wasn't allowed to associate the information before it was fatigued and the time effect was over."Micro-moments also align nicely with our ongoing practice in our lives. Waiting for the kettle to boil can become a quick review of a key definition. A bus ride can be used to solve a short practice problem. Mohta further suggested -Before bed, a learner can summarise one main idea from the day. These small windows, used consistently, accumulate into hours of meaningful study without blocking out large portions of the day. This method benefits from the ‘spacing effect’, a well-documented phenomenon where information is better retained when revisited at intervals. You can study a topic for five minutes today, then two days later, then next week. Each time you revisit the topic, it will reinforce your memories of it, adding another layer, like adding coats of varnish to wood. The secret is to keep each session sharply focused. One small goal could be understanding a formula, remembering a date, or to learn perhaps 3 words.He pointed out, "The full five minutes are complete focus and uninterrupted focus. No distractions, nothing else taking your attention, pure focus. At the end of some time, it is then simply left for the brain to allow consolidation before the next focus period."In an information-heavy world, micro-moments make fragmented time valuable learning moments. Learning is about attention and logic and less about seat time. Even in the smallest fragments of time, the return can be massive. The very notion of mastery is achieved in conscious moments in time. Five focused minutes can shape a lifetime of understanding and intellectual assurance.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future.

The initiative aims to improve access to Class 11–12 education in rural and semi-urban areas, reduce dropout rates, and strengthen public schools amid declining enrollment, with an estimated expenditure of Rs 29.39 crore.  Chennai, India: The Department of School Education has announced plans to upgrade 20 government high schools across Tamil Nadu into higher secondary schools for the 2025–26 academic year.The initiative, aimed at expanding access to higher secondary education, follows a budget announcement earlier this year by School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi.As part of the upgradation process, 200 postgraduate teachers will be appointed, with ten teachers assigned to each school. Subject-wise allocations include Tamil, English, physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, history, economics, computer science, and commerce.Teachers will be recruited under the pay scale of Rs 36,900–1,16,600 (Level-18), with the state government approving an estimated expenditure of Rs 29.39 crore for the project.Among the schools identified for upgradation is Mathur Government High School in Chennai’s Madhavaram block. Other districts benefiting include Cuddalore, Kallakurichi, Krishnagiri, Chengalpattu, Dindigul, Tiruchy, Tirupattur, Madurai, Villupuram, Ramanathapuram, Tiruppur, Salem, Tiruvannamalai, Nagapattinam, and Kanniyakumari.Officials said the initiative aims to ensure students in rural and semi-urban areas can continue studies up to Class 12 without shifting schools or discontinuing education.“It is about time certain high schools are upgraded. This will help reduce dropout rates and encourage students to pursue higher education within their localities,” a government school teacher said.However, the development comes amid challenges in the state’s education system, with declining enrollment in several schools. The Department of Elementary Education (DEE) recently closed 208 state-run schools due to zero admissions. Overall, 1,204 schools across Tamil Nadu recorded no new enrollments this academic year, including 208 government primary and middle schools, 114 government-aided schools, 11 partially-funded schools, 869 private institutions, and two union government schools.Officials hope that upgrading high schools to higher secondary will strengthen the public school system and restore confidence among parents and communities in state-run institutions.

SC declines to hear Sanjay Singh’s plea against merger of 105 UP primary schools
The Supreme Court on Monday refused to entertain AAP MP Sanjay Singh’s plea against the Uttar Pradesh government’s decision to merge 105 primary schools, asking him to approach the Allahabad High Court instead. Singh argued the move was arbitrary, violated children’s right to education under Article 21A and the RTE Act, and forced longer travel without transport facilities.

Singh argued the move was arbitrary, violated children’s right to education under Article 21A and the RTE Act, and forced longer travel without transport facilities.  New Delhi, India: The Supreme Court on Monday refused to entertain a plea filed by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh challenging the Uttar Pradesh government’s decision to pair and merge 105 government-run primary schools.“Are you not trying to enforce rights under the Right to Education Act? If it is a statutory right, then it cannot be camouflaged as a writ petition under Article 32 (dealing with enforcement of fundamental rights)! Let the Allahabad High Court decide the matter,” a Bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and A.G. Masih remarked at the outset.Sensing the Bench’s reluctance to hear the matter, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Singh, sought permission to withdraw the plea with liberty to approach the Allahabad High Court. The apex court then dismissed the matter as withdrawn.Singh’s petition had argued that the government’s decision, formalised through a June 16 order and a June 24 list, was “arbitrary, unconstitutional, and legally impermissible.”It said the merger of schools with low enrolment had adversely affected access to education, forcing children to travel longer distances without transportation or other facilities. This, the plea contended, violated the right to free and compulsory education under Article 21A and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 (RTE Act).Citing Rule 4 of the Uttar Pradesh RTE Rules, 2011, the petition stressed that primary schools must be located “within one kilometre of a child’s residence, particularly in habitations with a population of not less than 300 persons.”“The state government cannot discharge its duty merely by showing that another school exists somewhere in the vicinity. If the school is beyond 1 km, it violates Rule 4(1)(a) unless the exceptions under Rule 4(2) are met — which they are not,” the plea stated.It further argued that any policy or executive action compelling children to travel unreasonable distances to attend school — such as closures or mergers — is prima facie unconstitutional and contrary to Article 21A and the RTE Act.The petition also cited the Mohini Jain vs State of Karnataka and Unnikrishnan, J.P. vs State of Andhra Pradesh judgments, which affirmed the right to education as flowing from the right to life and dignity, and as a fundamental right up to the age of 14.

With a political career spanning over four decades, he has served as Lok Sabha MP, state BJP president, and governor of Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Telangana, and Puducherry. His extensive experience in governance and party organisation has positioned him as a key contender for the vice presidency scheduled for September 9. CP Radhakrishnan educational qualification and political career: From Tamil Nadu BJP leader to Maharashtra governor and NDA vice-presidential candidate Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader CP Radhakrishnan has been named as the National Democratic Alliance's (NDA) candidate for the upcoming vice-presidential election. The announcement came after the resignation of Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar, with the election scheduled to take place on September 9. Radhakrishnan currently serves as the Governor of Maharashtra and holds additional responsibilities as Governor of Telangana and Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry.This appointment marks a significant milestone in Radhakrishnan's over four-decade-long political career, which began with his association with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Bharatiya Janata Party in Tamil Nadu. His educational background and diverse political experience have played key roles in his rise to prominent positions within Indian politics.Early life and educational qualificationChandrapuram Ponnusamy Radhakrishnan was born in Tiruppur, Tamil Nadu, into the Kongu Vellalar Gounder community. He holds a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) degree from V. O. Chidambaram College in Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu. Alongside his academic pursuits, he was a college-level table tennis champion, showcasing a diverse range of interests from an early age.From the age of 17, Radhakrishnan was actively involved with the RSS and Bharatiya Jana Sangh. His formal entry into politics came with his election to the Jan Sangh's state executive committee in 1974, laying the foundation for his long political journey.Political career in Tamil Nadu and Lok SabhaRadhakrishnan first rose to national prominence as a two-time Member of Parliament (MP) representing Coimbatore in the Lok Sabha, winning elections in 1998 and 1999. His 1998 election was notable as he was one of three BJP candidates to win in Tamil Nadu following the party's alliance with the AIADMK, an important achievement in the state's political landscape. During his tenure, he served as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Textiles and was a member of committees on Public Sector Undertakings and Finance.He was also part of the Indian parliamentary delegation to the United Nations General Assembly in 2004, where he addressed humanitarian and disaster relief coordination. His political career in Tamil Nadu further advanced when he became the BJP state president from 2004 to 2007. During this period, he undertook a 93-day, 19,000-kilometre 'Ratha Yatra', advocating various social and environmental causes across the state.Governorship and administrative rolesIn 2016, Radhakrishnan was appointed Chairman of the Coir Board, under the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, where he oversaw record exports valued at Rs 2,532 crore. He later served as BJP's all-India in-charge for Kerala from 2020 to 2022, contributing to the party's organisational efforts in the state.In February 2023, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appointed Radhakrishnan as the Governor of Jharkhand. Within his first four months in office, he visited all 24 districts to engage with local officials and citizens. In July 2024, he assumed office as Governor of Maharashtra. Around the same time, he was given additional responsibilities as Governor of Telangana and Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry, roles he held until July 2024 before handing over to successors.NDA's vice-presidential candidateFollowing the resignation of Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar citing health reasons, BJP national president JP Nadda announced CP Radhakrishnan's candidacy for the vice-presidential election. Radhakrishnan's vast experience in politics and governance, combined with his organisational background and administrative roles as governor, positions him as a seasoned candidate for the post.The vice-presidential election will be held on September 9, with the last date for filing nominations on August 21 and withdrawal by August 25. Radhakrishnan's selection reflects the NDA's strategy to field a leader with strong organisational roots and experience in both legislative and administrative spheres.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

Netaji 'fled fearing British'? Kerala's SCERT corrects textbook error and launches inquiry

The mistake was flagged by teachers and quickly removed, prompting an internal inquiry. The controversy sparked criticism from the ABVP, accusing the Kerala government of distorting history and undermining national unity. Complaints have been filed demanding strict action and better oversight of educational materials. Kerala's SCERT removes error on Netaji Bose amid ABVP protests and historical dispute Kerala's State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) recently corrected a factual error in a Class 4 teachers' handbook that stated Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose 'fled to Germany, fearing the British' before forming the Indian National Army (INA). The mistake, which misrepresented the freedom fighter's role, was flagged by teachers soon after the handbook's release and subsequently rectified by SCERT.The handbook, designed to assist educators in following the state syllabus, originally contained a brief note on Bose's political journey, including his tenure as Congress president and the founding of the Forward Bloc. However, the incorrect phrase suggesting he fled out of fear was removed following swift feedback from teachers, according to an official statement cited by local media.Error spotted and corrected following teacher feedbackThe SCERT handbook was intended to provide accurate background information and teaching instructions for Class 4 Environmental Studies. Upon receiving the teachers' feedback, SCERT immediately recalled the handbook and issued a revised version, assuring parents and educators of improved quality control in future publications.An official confirmed to media outlets that an internal inquiry has been launched to determine how the error bypassed the review process. The statement read that "more rigorous quality checks will be enforced going forward to avoid such errors," as reported by the press.Political reactions and accusations of distorted historyThe controversy attracted sharp criticism from the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), which accused the CPI(M)-led Kerala government of deliberately spreading distorted historical narratives through textbooks and handbooks. The student organisation claimed the erroneous description of Netaji was "fake propaganda" intended to defame a national hero who sacrificed his life for India's independence.ABVP National Secretary Shravan B. Raj alleged that portraying Netaji as a coward was a "malicious lie." He also pointed out other serious errors in the same textbook, such as the omission of Assam and Jharkhand from the map of India, which the ABVP described as part of a larger conspiracy to undermine national unity. Raj stated, as quoted by the media, that the ruling party's actions were "a calculated attempt by the Communist Party-led Kerala government to manipulate the young generation with fake narratives."Concerns over educational content and national integrityE.U. Eswaraprasad, ABVP Kerala State Secretary, highlighted that the incident revealed a "poisonous narrative" promoted by the Education Department. He criticised Kerala's claim of being a model state, calling the error a "heinous act" and "a deliberate ploy" to implant anti-national ideas among students. Eswaraprasad said the ABVP had submitted formal complaints to the state Education Minister and the Director of NCERT, demanding strict action against officials responsible, according to press reports.The ABVP also vowed to launch protests if corrective measures were not implemented promptly. The controversy over the historical error in the SCERT handbook has therefore escalated into a larger debate over the politicisation of academic content and the safeguarding of accurate historical knowledge in school curricula.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.
