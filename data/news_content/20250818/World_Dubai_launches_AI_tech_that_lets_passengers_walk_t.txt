This marks a major step toward seamless, document-free travel and next-gen airport experiences. ChatGPT said:Dubai's AI-powered immigration corridor at DXB processes ten passengers at once, enabling seamless, document-free entry using biometric verification/Representative Image  Dubai International Airport has launched a cutting-edge, AI-powered corridor that allows travellers to bypass traditional passport control in seconds. Unveiled by the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA), the new system can process multiple passengers simultaneously—marking a global first in airport immigration technology and advancing Dubai’s vision for seamless, document-free travel.A global first: AI corridor redefines airport clearanceDubai has introduced the world’s first artificial intelligence-powered immigration corridor at Dubai International Airport (DXB), which has retained its title as the busiest international airport for the 11th consecutive year. The initiative was officially announced by Lieutenant General Mohammed Ahmed Al Marri, Director General of the GDRFA.This innovation enables passengers to walk across a special passage—referred to internally as the “red carpet”—to complete immigration formalities without stopping or presenting travel documents. Up to ten passengers can pass through at the same time, a significant improvement over the traditional one-passenger-at-a-time model.The AI corridor is a major step within Dubai’s broader “travel without borders” strategy. It is designed as part of a larger integrated system aimed at providing faster, smoother, and more secure transit for travellers.How the AI corridor works: Speed meets securityThe AI corridor processes passenger information automatically and in real time. Using advanced artificial intelligence, the system identifies and verifies travellers before they reach the immigration checkpoint, allowing them to walk through without presenting ID or stopping for inspection.Despite the speed and simplicity, security is not compromised. The system includes built-in mechanisms that flag any suspicious passports and immediately route them to forgery experts for review. This ensures robust screening while reducing manual workload and queue times.As a result, overall processing capacity has doubled, helping reduce congestion and improving efficiency during high-traffic periods.Enhancing Dubai’s global standingLieutenant General Al Marri highlighted that DXB is not merely a transit point but a prominent international gateway that reflects the UAE’s progressive identity and hospitality. The launch of the AI-powered corridor reinforces Dubai’s standing as a hub of technological innovation and operational excellence.He further stated that the GDRFA’s work aligns with a long-term innovation roadmap that focuses on leveraging technology to modernise and streamline border control procedures. The shift toward automated, document-free travel is expected to become a defining feature of global air travel, with Dubai leading that transformation.Key Features and Operational ImpactSimultaneous ProcessingThe corridor allows up to 10 passengers to pass through at once, significantly accelerating throughput.No Document Requirement Travellers do not need to present passports or ID, as the system uses AI-based identity recognition.Pre-Arrival Data Recognition Passenger data is matched and verified before arrival at the checkpoint, enabling real-time clearance.Automated Security Protocols If irregularities are detected, suspicious documents are automatically flagged and sent to specialist forgery teams.Scalable Infrastructure By increasing efficiency, the corridor is built to support higher passenger volumes during peak times without adding congestion.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
