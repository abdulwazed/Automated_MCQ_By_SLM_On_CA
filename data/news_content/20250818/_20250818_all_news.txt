NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Monday met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in New Delhi and held a meeting. In his meeting with Wang, Jaishankar said that the differences must not become disputes between the two countries. "The fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations is another major priority. I look forward to our exchange of views. Overall, it is our expectation that our discussions would contribute to building a stable cooperative and forward-looking relationship between India and China, one that serves both our interests and addresses our concerns," Jaishankar said in the meeting. Jaishankar said that there will be a discussion on border issues between Wang Yi and Special Representative NSA Ajit Doval on Tuesday.

It is also essential that the de-escalation process move forward," he said."When the world's two largest nations meet, it is natural that the international situation will be discussed. We seek a fair, balanced and multipolar world order, including a multipolar Asia. Reform multilateralism is also the call of the day.

China shared confidence to dispel interference, expand cooperation and to further consolidate the momentum of improvement development of the relations, so that while pursuing the respective rejuvenation, Beijing can contribute to each other's success and provide the most needed certainty to Asia and the world. The meeting follows Doval’s December trip to Beijing for the 23rd round of talks, held weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed in Kazan to revive dialogue mechanisms during the BRICS summit.Wang's visit comes ahead of PM Modi's trip to China to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin from August 31 to September 1. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Wang’s visit reflects Beijing’s intent to implement understandings reached between the two leaders, maintain high-level exchanges, deepen political trust, expand cooperation, and properly manage differences to ensure stable development of bilateral ties. Mao described the SR-level dialogue as a crucial channel for advancing boundary negotiations. She noted that the previous round in Beijing produced agreements on delimitation, border management, and cross-border cooperation. Both sides, she said, have been working through diplomatic channels this year to implement those outcomes. Looking ahead, Mao said China is prepared to continue constructive engagement with India on the basis of existing consensus to jointly preserve peace and stability along the border.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Chaturvedi, part of a delegation highlighting India's anti-terrorism stance post-Operation Sindoor, emphasized representing the nation abroad despite being a vocal opposition member domestically. She also criticized the Election Commission of India, expressing concerns about eroding public trust and perceived bias towards the BJP.  NEW DELHI: A humorous moment of Shiv Sena (UBT) Rajya Sabha MP Priyanka Chaturvedi on a podcast brought Congress Lok Sabha MP Shashi Tharoor again into the limelight. During a podcast interview, Chaturvedi was questioned about posting pictures with Prime Minister Modi and public reactions. She quipped, “I sometimes love irritating people, because they are so invested in my life, where is she going next, where’s she going next?” Prakash responded by joking, “You’re basically Shashi Tharoor in a saree.” Chaturvedi laughed, saying, “I don’t know whether that is a compliment for Shashi or for me, but I am going to tell Shashi.”PollDo you think Priyanka Chaturvedi's comments about irritating people were humorous?Yes, very funnyNo, not funny at all The clip was later shared on X by Chaturvedi, prompting a witty reply from Tharoor: “Thanks Priyanka. I consider myself flattered either way.” Chaturvedi mentioned she first shared her picture with Narendra Modi on Instagram, which subsequently spread on X and other platforms. She recounted in a funny, imitating tone, “We had said she went on the Parliament delegation, and it happened there.” Chaturvedi was part of the Group-2 delegation led by BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad that visited European nations to highlight India’s stance against terrorism. The visit followed India’s Operation Sindoor, targeting terror infrastructures in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.When asked about representing India after Opertaion Sindoor, especially being in opposition, Chaturvedi said, "That I'm a very vocal member of the opposition when I'm in my country. But when I'm outside my country, I'm the ambassador for my nation." She also criticised the Election Commission of India (ECI), stating that public trust in the poll body is waning. “Day by day, new names are being added and removed from the rolls. Now, the system has been exposed. We have seen their press conference, and the language used was deeply unfortunate. Today, people no longer trust the Election Commission. The public will surely ask why their confidence is not being earned. It seems the Commission is focused only on winning the BJP’s trust,” Chaturvedi told ANI.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Tharoor emphasized the mission's invaluable contribution to Gaganyaan, citing hands-on experience, crucial data, and the testing of Indian systems.  NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Monday said the Opposition will not participate in the special discussion in the Lok Sabha on astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla’s space mission. However, Tharoor praised the achievement, calling it a landmark moment for India’s space ambitions replying to Kiren Rijiju's post on X urging discussion on Shubhanshu Shukla.“Since the Opposition are not participating in the special discussion, let me say how proud all Indians are of the recent mission of Commander Shubhanshu Shukla to the International Space Station (ISS). It served as a stepping stone to our nation's own human spaceflight program, Gaganyaan. Shukla's mission provided ISRO invaluable hands-on experience & data that cannot be replicated in simulations,” Tharoor wrote on X.He said Shukla’s first-hand observations on pre-launch procedures, spacecraft systems, and the psychological and physiological effects of microgravity were crucial for de-risking and refining the Gaganyaan mission. “The mission allowed for the testing of Indian systems & protocols in a real-life space environment. The numerous scientific experiments, including studies on human health in space and plant growth, provide technological and scientific validation which will directly help design the life-support and medical systems for Gaganyaan,” Tharoor added.The Congress MP also underscored the diplomatic impact of the mission. “Shukla's mission, conducted in partnership with international agencies, reinforced India's role in global space diplomacy. It demonstrates India's willingness and capability to engage in multilateral space efforts and opens doors for future joint research and investment,” he said.Tharoor concluded that the astronaut’s historic feat would inspire India’s youth. “Commander Shukla's historic flight serves as a powerful symbol of India's ambitions in human spaceflight. It has captured the nation's imagination, inspiring a new generation to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, maths and space studies — all essential for sustaining India's long-term space goals. Well done!”Union minister Kiren Rijiju meanwhile said the Lok Sabha would honour Shukla with a special discussion. “Our hero astronaut Capt Subhanshu Shukla has returned home after a successful mission to International Space Station. Parliament will honour him with a special discussion on his historic milestone and India’s growing space ambitions in our journey towards,” Rijiju wrote on X.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Concerns were raised about voter list irregularities in Maharashtra and Karnataka. Trinamool Congress leader Mahua Moitra called for dissolving the Lok Sabha. The opposition demands accountability from the Election Commission. Joint press conference by INDIA bloc leaders NEW DELHI: The INDIA bloc on Monday intensified its attack on the Election Commission, accusing it of misconduct in recent elections and questioning its decision to conduct a special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar just ahead of the state polls. Citing alleged irregularities in Maharashtra and Karnataka, leaders sharpened their criticism, with TMC’s Mahua Moitra even urging to "dissolve Lok Sabha immediately."The joint press conference, held at the Constitution Club of India, was attended by senior opposition leaders including Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi, SP’s Ramgopal Yadav, TMC’s Mahua Moitra, RJD’s Manoj Jha, AAP’s Sanjay Singh and others.Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi alleged that the EC failed to address serious concerns. "EC silent on voter additions in Maharashtra, discrepancies in rolls in Mahadevapura, video data deletion," he said. Gogoi further added, "EC in hands of officers who are taking sides, not probing any charges made by Opposition."PollDo you agree with the opposition's claim that the Election Commission is failing to address serious concerns?Yes, I agree.No, I disagree.At the presser, Congress leader said, "EC should first provide an affidavit that the voter list is clean, then we'll comply."Criticising the poll body’s recent actions, Gogoi remarked, "In its press conference yesterday, the EC (Election Commission) raised questions about the political parties when they had to explain why they were conducting SIR in a hurry. EC was silent on SIR in Bihar. They were also silent on how new 70 lakh voters were added between Lok Sabha and Maharashtra Assembly elections... It is clear that EC is under such officials who are not unbiased."TMC MP Mahua Moitra also raised concerns, saying, "West Bengal CM raised issue of duplicate EPIC voter cards, but issue not resolved." She went on to demand accountability, adding, "Action should be taken against past ECs for 'fraudulent' voter lists, dissolve Lok Sabha immediately."Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Arvind Sawant also hit out at the EC, saying, "The whimsical behaviour of the CEC made it seem like he was acting as a BJP spokesperson."About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The court has sought responses from the Centre and defense forces, exploring insurance coverage and enhanced ex-gratia payments for these cadets.  NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday sought response of the Centre and defence forces in a suo motu case on difficulties faced by cadets, who were medically discharged from military institutes on account of disabilities suffered during training programmes.A bench of Justices BV Nagarathna and R Mahadevan said the Centre should explore the possibility of granting an insurance cover to the cadets undergoing rigorous training in different military institutes to deal with any exigency of death or disabilities.The bench also asked Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for the Centre, to seek instruction on enhancing the Rs 40,000 ex-gratia amount granted to the cadets who get disabled during the training programme, to meet medical expenses.The top court also asked the Centre to explore a scheme for rehabilitation of these disabled candidates back into forces like desk jobs or any other work related to defence services, after their treatment is over."We want braveheart cadets to be in the forces. We don't want injuries or disability to be any kind of deterrent to these cadets, who undergo training after clearing various competitive examinations," the bench observed. It posted the matter for further hearing on September 4.The top court had registered on August 12 the suo motu case after a media report flagged the issue of these cadets, who were once part of training at the nation's top military institutes such as the National Defence Academy (NDA) and Indian Military Academy (IMA).According to the media report, there are around 500 officer cadets who have been medically discharged from these military institutes since 1985, due to varying degrees of disability incurred during training, and are now staring at mounting medical bills with an ex-gratia monthly payment that's far short of what they need.It said at the NDA alone, there are around 20 such cadets, who were medically discharged in just five years, between 2021 and July 2025.The media report further highlighted the plight of these cadets because as per rules, they are not entitled to the status of ex-servicemen (ESM), which would have made them eligible under the Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) for free treatment at military facilities and empanelled hospitals, since their disabilities took place during training before they were commissioned as officers.It had said that unlike soldiers in this category, who are entitled to ESM status, all that these officer cadets get now is an ex-gratia payment of up to Rs 40,000 per month depending on extent of disability - an amount that falls far short of basic needs.

We have not had any discussions (about impeachment) as of now, but if needed, we can do anything…”According to sources quoted by ANI, opposition parties may introduce an impeachment motion against Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar during the Monsoon Session.PollDo you support the idea of impeachment against Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar?Yes, it is necessaryNo, it is not warrantedThe remarks come after a row between Rahul Gandhi and the Election Commission over his allegations of “vote chori” in Karnataka. On Sunday, Gyanesh Kumar dismissed Rahul’s charges as “an insult” to the Constitution, asking him to either submit a signed affidavit or apologise within seven days. “An affidavit will have to be given or an apology should be made to the country. Teesra koi vikalp nahi (There is no third option),” Kumar said at a press conference in Delhi.Rahul Gandhi responded by questioning the poll body's impartiality, pointing to the BJP’s Anurag Thakur. “The Election Commission asks for an affidavit from me. But when Anurag Thakur says the same thing that I am saying, it does not ask for an affidavit from him,” he said. Congress leaders accused the CEC of sounding like a BJP spokesperson. Pawan Khera remarked, “It seemed like BJP was speaking today. Did he give any response about the 1 lakh voters we exposed in Mahadevapura?”Rahul Gandhi had earlier alleged large-scale irregularities in the Mahadevapura Assembly constituency, claiming that more than one lakh votes were “stolen” through duplicate and invalid entries. He also accused the poll body of “destroying evidence” by limiting CCTV footage storage to 45 days.While the CEC insisted that the Election Commission was standing “like a rock” with voters and dismissed the claims as baseless, opposition leaders from the RJD and JMM joined Congress in demanding clarity on Gandhi’s documents and allegations. The confrontation has deepened the stand-off between the Opposition and the poll body, now sharpened by Hussain’s suggestion that “all weapons of democracy” remain on the table.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The BJP nominated Radhakrishnan, currently the Governor of Maharashtra, aiming for a unanimous election. Prime Minister Modi lauded Radhakrishnan's dedication and intellect, highlighting his extensive community service. The vice-presidential election follows Jagdeep Dhankhar's resignation, with polling scheduled for September 9.  NEW DELHI: Janata Dal (united) president Nitish Kumar on Monday extended his party’s support to National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA) vice-presidential candidate, CP Radhakrishnan. In a post on X, Nitish Kumar said, “The decision to nominate Shri CP Radhakrishnan ji, the governor of Maharashtra, as the NDA’s candidate for Vice President is welcomed. JDU will support Shri CP Radhakrishnan ji. Best wishes to him.”The announcement came a day after the Bharatiya Janata Party declared Radhakrishnan as the NDA nominee. BJP president JP Nadda, after a meeting of the party’s Parliamentary Board, said the alliance aimed for a unanimous election. “We want next Vice-President to be elected unanimously, we have reached out to opposition leaders,” he said. He described Radhakrishnan as a respected statesman from Tamil Nadu.PollWhat qualities do you believe are most important for a Vice-President?Dedication and humility.Political experience.Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised the NDA pick, writing on X that Radhakrishnan’s “dedication, humility and intellect” would make him an inspiring Vice-President. “In his long years in public life, Thiru CP Radhakrishnan Ji has distinguished himself with his dedication, humility and intellect. During the various positions he has held, he has always focused on community service and empowering the marginalised. He has done extensive work at the grassroots in Tamil Nadu. I am glad that the NDA family has decided to nominate him as the Vice Presidential candidate of our alliance,” Modi said.He added, “Thiru CP Radhakrishnan Ji has rich experience as MP and Governor of various states. His Parliamentary interventions were always incisive. During his gubernatorial tenures, he focused on addressing challenges faced by common citizens. These experiences ensured that he has vast knowledge of legislative and Constitutional matters. I am confident he will be an inspiring Vice President.”Radhakrishnan is currently serving as the Governor of Maharashtra. He previously held gubernatorial responsibilities in Jharkhand, Telangana, and Puducherry. A veteran BJP leader, he has represented Coimbatore twice in the Lok Sabha and served as Tamil Nadu BJP president.The vice-presidential election was necessitated after former Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar resigned on July 21 citing health reasons. The opposition has claimed the move was linked to differences with the government.The Election Commission has scheduled polling for September 9, with counting of votes on the same day. The last date for filing nominations is August 21, while withdrawals are permitted until August 25. With its majority in Parliament, the NDA is seen as well placed to ensure Radhakrishnan’s victory, though the INDIA bloc is considering fielding a candidate.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

He was greeted by ministers, ISRO chairman, and space enthusiasts. Shukla is scheduled to meet PM Modi and participate in National Space Day celebrations, with Parliament set to discuss his mission and India's space program. Astronaut Subhanshu Shukla, along with astronaut Prashant Balakrishnan Nair, receives grand welcome from Union space minister Jitendra Singh, Delhi CM Rekha Gupta and and Isro chairman V Narayanan at the Delhi airport NEW DELHI: Following his historic mission to the International Space Station (ISS), Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla received a red-carpet welcome at Delhi’s IGI airport as he returned to the country from the US in the early hours of Sunday. Shukla, who piloted the spacecraft to the space station as part of the Axiom-4 mission, was welcomed by Union space minister Jitendra Singh, Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta and Isro chairman V Narayanan, and a large crowd of space enthusiasts at the airport.Posting on X later, minister Jitendra Singh said, “A moment of pride for India! A moment of glory for #ISRO! A moment of gratitude to the dispensation that facilitated this under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. India’s Space glory touches the Indian soil… as the iconic son of Mother India, Gaganyatri Shubhanshu Shukla lands at Delhi in the early hours of morning today. Accompanying him, another equally accomplished Group Captain Prasanth Balakrishnan Nair, one of the astronauts selected for India’s first Human mission Gaganyaan who was India’s designated backup for the mission to the ISS. Privileged to receive both of them”.Shukla is expected to meet PM Modi and then travel to his hometown Lucknow. He is likely to return to the Capital on Aug 22–23 to participate in the National Space Day celebrations.PollShould the Indian government invest more in space exploration?DefinitelyNo, we need to focus on other issuesThe Lok Sabha will hold a special discussion on Monday on India's space journey and Shukla's historic mission aboard the ISS, according to a notice issued by the lower House. The House will discuss “India's first astronaut aboard the ISS — critical role of space programme for Viksit Bharat by 2047”, which could possibly end the deadlock between the govt and opposition in Parliament over the electoral roll revision in Bihar.Earlier on Saturday, Shukla had posted a smiling photograph of himself on a flight and said he was filled with emotions. “As I sit on the plane to come back to India, I have a mix of emotions running through my heart. I feel sad leaving a fantastic group of people behind who were my friends and family for the past one year during this mission. I am also excited about meeting all my friends, family, and everyone in the country for the first time post mission. I guess this is what life is -- everything all at once," he said.In the 79th Independence Day speech at the Red Fort on Friday, PM Modi, while mentioning Group Captain Shukla’s successful mission to ISS, had said that India is working towards becoming self-reliant in the space sector and preparing for the launch of Gaganyaan, its indigenous human space flight mission, and is also working on developing its own space station.In June, Shukla became the second Indian to go to space — after IAF wing commander Rakesh Sharma in 1984— as part of the Axiom-4 mission to the ISS. During the 18-day mission, Shukla, along with astronauts Peggy Whitson (US), Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski (Poland), and Tibor Kapu (Hungary), conducted more than 60 experiments and 20 outreach sessions aboard the ISS. He returned to the Earth on July 16.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous8 best anti-ageing ingredients you should start using in your 20sLifestyle10 best vegetarian sources of IronLifestyleSalwar tales by gorgeous lady Shabana ShajahantvCars under Rs 6 lakh with six airbags: Maruti Alto, Nissan Magnite and moreautoKundali Bhagya fame Shraddha Arya’s stunning ethnic lookstvAnupama Parameswaran shines bright in striking snapsEntertainment'Coolie' actress Reba Monica John’s picture-perfect momentsEntertainmentMalavika Mohanan's stunning style moments you can't missEntertainmentJannat Zubair’s Gen-Z Style is Pure PerfectiontvEver heard of Flying fish?

Don't use 'not found suitable' tag to deny SC, ST teachers appointments, promotions: Parl panel
A parliamentary panel has strongly criticized the use of "Not Found Suitable (NFS)" to deny SC/ST teachers appointments and promotions, deeming it inappropriate and hurtful. The committee emphasized that there is no shortage of qualified SC/ST candidates and urged universities to judge applicants solely on academic merit.

The committee emphasized that there is no shortage of qualified SC/ST candidates and urged universities to judge applicants solely on academic merit. AI-generated image NEW DELHI: Touching a raw nerve among the deprived communities and champions of social justice, a key parliamentary panel said the "Not Found Suitable (NFS)" tag should not be used to deny SC and ST teachers opportunities in appointments and promotions, acknowledging the prevalence of the controversial practice while urging "better judgment" in recruitment of faculty members in universities.The Parliamentary Committee on SC/ST Welfare, while making the observation in context of a review of appointments in Delhi University, weighed in on a subject that has become a matter of wider concern. "While interacting with SC/ST teachers welfare association of DU, a glaring issue that came to fore was declaration of SC/ST teachers as 'NFS' for posts earmarked for them," it noted in a report tabled in the Parliament in its ongoing monsoon session."The committee vehemently condemns the usage of the term 'NFS' to deny eligible SC/ST teachers opportunities in appointments and promotions. The committee opines that declaring SC/ST candidates 'NFS' is not only inappropriate and hurts the sentiments of deserving, eligible and well qualified SC/ST candidates," the panel, headed by BJP MP Faggan Singh Kulaste, noted.The NFS debate revolves around allegations that authorities in educational institutions are manipulating fair employment opportunities for Dalits and tribals by dismissing candidatures as lacking suitability for faculty positions. Claiming large-scale vacancies against SC/ST quota in central universities, leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi recently blamed the governing BJP dispensation for 'NFS', which, he said, was being used to deny the marginalised communities leadership roles in education."NFS is the new Manuvaad now. Eligible candidates from SC/ST/OBC communities are being deliberately declared 'unsuitable' so that they are kept away from education and leadership," he had posted on social media, triggering strong backlash from BJP that accused Congress for marginalising the backward classes.Now, the parliamentary panel has said "in the present era there is no dearth of eligible SC/ST candidates holding impressive credentials in teaching fields. The committee recommend that SC/ST candidates applying for teaching posts should be judged solely on their academic prowess and that strict norms should not cloud the better judgement of selection panel."The panel urged that SC/ST candidates should be given ample opportunities and should be helped in achieving their professional goals.

The EC urged electors and political parties to utilize the remaining 15-day window to file claims and objections. New Delhi, Aug 17 (ANI): Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar addresses a press conference on Bihar Special Intensive Revision (SIR), at the National Media Centre in New Delhi on Sunday. (ANI Photo/Jitender Gupta) NEW DELHI: Stating that EC has uploaded the list of 65 lakh voters deleted from Bihar's draft electoral roll within 56 hours of SC's directive, CEC Gyanesh Kumar on Sunday exhorted electors and political parties in the state to file their claims and objections in the remaining 15-day timeframe, saying flagging any errors after Sept 1, shall be pointless.Justifying its decision to undertake SIR exercise in Bihar, EC said all the political parties had, for the past two decades, been demanding that imperfections in electoral roll be corrected. "Acting on this demand, EC decided to take up SIR, starting with Bihar," he told a press conference here, while adding that the timeline for SIR in other poll-bound states will be announced "at the appropriate time".Slamming the "vote theft" allegations levelled by opposition parties and their chiefs, EC said the electors, party representatives and booth level officers on the ground are working in a harmonious and transparent manner, endorsing the exercise with their signatures and video testimonials. "It is a matter of concern that endorsements of district presidents and booth level agents of parties are either not reaching their state level and national leadership, or the latter have chosen to overlook these, and are trying to spread misinformation," said Kumar.PollDo you think the public awareness about filing claims and objections regarding the electoral roll is sufficient?Yes, people are well-informedNo, more awareness is neededClearing the air on timing of SIR, the CEC said that since the annual summary revision was with respect to Jan 1, 2025, April 1 was too early to start the next revision, while Oct 1 would have been too close to the assembly poll due in Bihar in Nov. As regards allegations of hundreds and thousands of voters being registered on the same address, Kumar said in the absence of proper numbering of houses/addresses by the panchayats/municipalities and also the presence of unauthorised settlements, it has been an accepted norm for EC/BLO to register voters from notional addresses, often carrying 'zero' house number. Electoral roll excerpts shared by EC with TOI, of Assam in 1966, Rajasthan in 1980, UP in 1985, show their house number as either missing or as '01'.About the AuthorBharti JainBharti Jain is senior editor with The Times of India, New Delhi.

California Governor Gavin Newsom's office passed the buck on President Donald Trump on the issue of illegal alien Harjinder Singh who has been charged with vehicular homicide after his wrong U-turn killed three people in Florida. 35-year-old Harjinder, who is from India, has a commercial driver's license in Dem-ruled California that triggered a political slugfest with Republicans blaming Dem states of becoming the sanctuaries of illegal aliens. Newsom's office said Singh entered the US in 2018 when Trump was the president. Under California's law, one gets a commercial driver's license only when they have a lawful presence in the country, Newsom's office said.Deportation after criminal proceedingsThe video of Harjinder and a co-passenger inside the truck moments before taking the wrong turn went viral. The accident took place on August 12 near Fort Pierce on the Florida Turnpike when Singh turned his tractor-trailer through an "unauthorized location" which was meant of office use only. After the video went viral, it was found out that Singh entered the US illegally through the southern border in 2018. It's not clear how he managed a driver's license if he was an illegal alien. Singh faces three counts of vehicular homicide. Under Florida law, vehicular homicide is a second-degree felony, punishable by up to 15 years in prison. He faces deportation after criminal proceedings. California driver's license ruleCalifornia's Assembly Bill 60 (AB 60), enacted in 2015, allows undocumented immigrants to apply for a driver's license if they can provide proof of identity and California residency. These licenses are marked "not for federal identification.""This incident underscores the importance and urgency of the work that the Trump Administration is doing to audit CDL issuances nationwide, in addition to its enhanced enforcement of English-language proficiency—a fundamental requirement for operating commercial vehicles in interstate commerce," chief operation officer of American Trucking Association Dan Hovrath told Newsweek.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

He plans an executive order targeting voting machines and advocates for watermarked paper ballots, claiming they're faster and more reliable.  US President Donald Trump on Monday announced that he will lead a movement to end mail-in ballots and voting machines before the 2026 midterm elections, arguing they fuel "massive voter fraud" and erode trust in the electoral process.Sharing a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he plans to sign an executive order targeting what he called “highly inaccurate” and “controversial” voting machines, while pushing for a return to traditional paper ballots. He argued that traditional paper ballots with watermarks were faster, more reliable, and would leave “no doubt” about election outcomes."I am going to lead a movement to get rid of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, and also, while we’re at it, Highly “Inaccurate,” Very Expensive, and Seriously Controversial VOTING MACHINES, which cost Ten Times more than accurate and sophisticated Watermark Paper, which is faster, and leaves NO DOUBT, at the end of the evening, as to who WON, and who LOST, the Election," Trump posted."We are now the only Country in the World that uses Mail-In Voting. All others gave it up because of the MASSIVE VOTER FRAUD ENCOUNTERED. WE WILL BEGIN THIS EFFORT, WHICH WILL BE STRONGLY OPPOSED BY THE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THEY CHEAT AT LEVELS NEVER SEEN BEFORE, by signing an EXECUTIVE ORDER to help bring HONESTY to the 2026 Midterm Elections," he added.Trump further claimed that states act merely as “agents” of the federal government in counting and tabulating votes, insisting they must follow presidential directives “for the good of the country.” He accused Democrats of relying on mail-in voting to remain competitive, pointing to what he called their “radical left” policies on immigration, gender issues, and social reforms, which he argued made them “virtually unelectable without using this completely disproven mail-in scam.”“With their HORRIBLE Radical Left policies, like Open Borders, Men Playing in Women’s Sports, Transgender and “WOKE” for everyone, and so much more, Democrats are virtually Unelectable without using this completely disproven Mail-In SCAM,” he said. Trump further accused his rivals of relying on a “mail-in scam” to win saying, “Elections can never be honest with mail-in ballots or voting machines, and everybody knows it, especially the Democrats.”He added that restoring “honesty and integrity” to the election system would be a core Republican goal going into the midterms.What is mail-in voting? Mail-in voting allows voters to cast ballots by post. It includes absentee ballots, typically reserved for voters unable to reach polling stations due to illness, travel, or other valid reasons, and mail-in ballots, which in many states can be requested by any eligible voter without providing a reason.Mail-in ballot: The actual ballot paper that you fill out and send back by mail under the mail-in voting system.Why is Trump opposed to it?Although mail-in voting has long existed in the US, Trump has repeatedly attacked it since the 2020 presidential election, claiming it enables large-scale fraud. Despite these claims, election officials and courts have found no evidence of widespread fraud linked to mail-in voting.

They are aware that a meeting is taking place today in Washington that will address the end of the war,” Zelenskyy wrote on X. “The Russians are deliberately killing people, particularly children. Seven people have been killed as a result of the drone strike in Kharkiv, the youngest being a girl who is only a year and a half old. Dozens have been injured, including children.”Attacks across multiple regionsRussian strikes also targeted Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, the Sumy region, and Odesa, destroying residential buildings and critical infrastructure, as per the report by Reuters.In Zaporizhzhia, a Russian missile attack killed three people and wounded 20, with “many in critical condition,” according to regional governor Ivan Fedorov.Zelenskyy condemned a deliberate strike on an energy facility in Odesa belonging to Azerbaijan’s SOCAR company. “This implies that it was an attack not only on us but also on our relations and energy security,” he said.Diplomatic efforts and Washington talksZelenskyy is set to meet Trump in Washington to discuss key issues related to ending the conflict, alongside leaders from the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Finland, the EU, and Nato.“The Russian war machine continues to destroy lives despite everything. Putin will commit demonstrative killings to maintain pressure on Ukraine and Europe, as well as to humiliate diplomatic efforts,” Zelenskyy said. “That is precisely why we are seeking assistance to put an end to the killings. Reliable security guarantees are required. Russia should not be rewarded for its participation in this war. The war must be ended. And it is Moscow that must hear the word: ‘Stop.’”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

A 30-year-old Google software engineer, Surbhi Madan, shared her experience of being on an H-1B visa, though she calls the US her home since 2013, when she came to the country for her bachelor's at Brown University. In an interview with Business Insider on the highs and the lows of the big tech visa which is a bone of contention in the US politics now, the Indian-origin Google employee said how H-1B gave her so many opportunities in life but still her life in the US feels temporary -- because of H-1B. Madan was one of the luckiest to have received her H-1B visa in the lottery on her first try in 2017, but it was a different time, she said. Companies were hiring and willing to sponsor H-1B applications. Since then, Madan has been with Google and is now a senior software engineer. Now she want to pivot her career into teaching but H-1B does not allow her to do that. "I'm anxious about making mistakes when I drive or file taxes because I don't want anything to threaten my stay in the country. Because of the visa, my life in the US feels temporary," Madan said. "I have an option to renew my apartment lease for one or two years, and I always choose one year because I never know how long I'll be allowed to live in the US," she said. Sharing an experience of how US officials see legal immigrants, Madan said, once she was returning to the US after traveling abroad. At immigration, she was asked about her purpose of visit. "I live here," she told the officer. "You don't live here; you work here," the officer said, leaving an impact on her mind. The Trump administration is aiming to overhaul the H-1B system as the MAGA activists are advocating for scrapping of it. The new proposed rule will allow tech companies to hire foreign talents only for higher, high-wage positions.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The UAE Football Association has warned clubs against publicly criticizing referees, following Al Ain’s complaints after their 2-1 win over Al Bataeh.

Al Ain’s coach claimed five goals were disallowed, while the match featured the Pro League’s 9,000th goal and debuted a new stadium cooling system. Al Ain’s 2-1 win included three disallowed goals, the Pro League’s 9,000th goal, and sparked UAEFA’s warning on referee criticism/Image: X The UAE Football Association has issued a firm directive to clubs after Al Ain FC publicly questioned refereeing decisions in their season-opening win. The Association underscored that legal steps will be taken against any party undermining match officials, marking a decisive move to safeguard the integrity of Emirati referees.UAEFA takes a stand on referee criticismThe UAE Football Association (UAEFA) released a sharply worded statement warning clubs against challenging the competence or impartiality of match officials. The move follows comments made by Al Ain Football Club after their 2-1 win over Al Bataeh in the opening round of the 2024-25 ADNOC Pro League.According to the Association, any inappropriate public criticism of referees will lead to legal consequences. It emphasized that the authority for developing and overseeing the refereeing system lies solely with UAEFA and is managed through specialized committees and qualified professionals operating within structured frameworks.The statement also referenced a pattern of administrative missteps by Al Ain over the past two seasons. UAEFA said these were previously addressed with professionalism but added that it expects the club to focus on improving its internal processes and refrain from involving itself in areas outside its purview.Al Ain’s post match remarks spark controversyThe controversy began after Al Ain’s head coach, Vladimir Ivić, expressed frustration with the match officiating during his post-match press conference. The Serbian coach stated that his team had scored five times, with three goals disallowed. “For the first time in my career, I saw my team score five goals but the final result was 2-1. We definitely deserved more,” he said.The club also issued an official comment on its platforms, referring to “numerous controversial refereeing incidents” in the game. While affirming support for the domestic refereeing system, the club stated it “firmly rejects the continued occurrence of mistakes that could negatively affect the team’s results in domestic competitions.”In response, UAEFA criticized the tone and content of Al Ain's statements, highlighting the need for all clubs to uphold sportsmanship and show respect for the work of others in the football ecosystem.Legal consequences and available alternativesThe Association confirmed that legal action will be initiated against Al Ain FC and any other individual or entity that publicly undermines match officials. It reiterated that complaints about officiating must be handled through formal channels, not public statements.As an alternative for clubs dissatisfied with domestic referees, UAEFA noted that there is an established mechanism for requesting foreign match officials. This provision, however, must be used through the proper channels and approvals.Match highlights and milestones from Al Ain vs Al BataehOn the field, the match itself was notable beyond the controversy. Togolese striker Kodjo Fo-Doh Laba scored during first-half stoppage time, registering the 9,000th goal in ADNOC Pro League history — a significant milestone for the competition.Al Bataeh responded in the 69th minute with an equalizer from Uzbekistan international Azizjon Ganiev. However, Al Ain sealed their opening victory in the 82nd minute with a decisive header from Abdoul Karim Traoré.The match also marked the debut of Al Ain’s newly installed integrated cooling system at Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium. Over 300 air-conditioning units were operational to enhance fan comfort amid the UAE’s intense summer temperatures. Despite the off-field tensions, fans turned out in large numbers, with long queues at food outlets reflecting the growing attendance and engagement at league games.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The daily and monthly toll caps are being removed, leading to unlimited charges. Exemptions remain for specific groups, as these changes aim to reduce congestion and promote public transport use. Abu Dhabi will extend Darb road toll operating hours by an additional two hours daily/Representative Image Abu Dhabi will extend Darb road toll operating hours by an additional two hours daily from September 1, 2025, as part of updates aimed at easing city traffic congestion and encouraging public transport use. The new rules also scrap the daily and monthly fee caps, marking major changes for regular commuters across the capital.TL;DR:Darb toll hours are extended: Evening charges apply from 3pm to 7pm, Monday to Saturday (previously 5pm to 7pm).Dh4 toll applies per pass at all four main bridges during morning (7am–9am) and new extended afternoon hours.Daily and monthly toll caps are removed; charges are now unlimited. Exemptions remain for eligible groups, and tolls do not apply on Sundays or public holidays.New toll timings and locationsFrom September 1, 2025, motorists in Abu Dhabi will pay Dh4 for each trip through Darb toll gates between 3pm and 7pm (Monday to Saturday), in addition to the unchanged morning window of 7am to 9am. Tolls are not charged outside these peak periods, nor on Sundays and public holidays. Abu Dhabi’s four main toll gates are at Sheikh Khalifa Bridge, Sheikh Zayed Bridge, Al Maqta Bridge, and Musaffah Bridge, key entrance points to the city. These changes are managed by Q Mobility, under the Department of Municipalities and Transport.A major update is the removal of daily and monthly fee limits, meaning motorists will pay the Dh4 charge each time they use a toll gate during charging hours. Previously, charges could not exceed Dh16 per day, while monthly caps depended on how many vehicles a user owned. With caps abolished, high-frequency users should budget accordingly.Exemptions and policy rationaleExemption policies remain unchanged for people with disabilities, low-income families, senior citizens, and retirees. The extension and cap removal are intended to improve peak hour traffic flow, reduce congestion, and prompt more commuters to consider public transit, especially given the city’s ongoing population boom. Abu Dhabi’s population now exceeds 4.1 million, up 51% in a decade; surging vehicle registrations and rapid development underscore the importance of adaptive traffic management strategies in the emirate.With extended toll hours and the removal of daily and monthly payment limits, Abu Dhabi is signaling a shift toward tighter congestion control and stronger incentives for public transport. Motorists are urged to adjust their travel habits and budgets as these new rules take effect.FAQ1.

Backed by strategic infrastructure upgrades led by the Ministry of Transport, the performance highlights the ports’ growing efficiency and capacity across key hubs like Salalah, Sohar, and Duqm. Oman’s ports handled 2.42 million TEUs, 70.1 million tonnes of cargo, and welcomed 6,586 ships in H1 2025/Representative Image Oman’s ports recorded a robust performance in the first half of 2025, driven by increases in ship arrivals, container throughput, cargo volume, and vehicle and livestock imports. Backed by strategic infrastructure initiatives from the Ministry of Transport, Communications, and Information Technology, these gains underline the growing capacity and efficiency of the country’s maritime logistics sector.Surge in container handling and cargo throughputContainer activity at Oman’s three major ports — Salalah, Sohar, and Duqm — rose significantly in the first six months of 2025. According to the Ministry of Transport, Communications, and Information Technology, a total of 2,427,195 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) were handled during this period. This marks an 11.7% increase compared to the 2,173,508 TEUs managed in the same timeframe of 2024.In tandem, the overall volume of goods handled by Omani ports also grew. Ports collectively processed 70,114,527 tonnes of cargo from January to June 2025, compared to 66,620,847 tonnes in the corresponding period last year — a 5.2% increase. The rise highlights both the enhanced logistics capacity and the growing demand across Oman’s key port hubs.Higher ship arrivals at key portsShip traffic to and through Oman also saw notable growth. During the first half of 2025, 6,586 ships arrived at Omani ports and marine docks outside port facilities. This reflects an 11.1% growth compared to the 5,930 vessels recorded in the same period of 2024.Several key ports were primary contributors to this upward trend. Among them:Sultan Qaboos PortShinas PortPort of SalalahThese ports played a central role in absorbing the increased maritime activity and accommodating the expanded flow of vessels into the country.Growth in vehicle and livestock importsBeyond containers and cargo, Omani ports also saw an uptick in other import categories. In the first half of 2025:50,248 vehicles were received through the ports.2,694,293 heads of livestock were imported.These figures underscore the ports' importance not just for trade and industry, but also for meeting diverse economic and commercial needs ranging from the automotive sector to food supply chains.Strategic port infrastructure initiatives underwayTo sustain and support this growth, the Ministry of Transport, Communications, and Information Technology has advanced several infrastructure projects aimed at enhancing port capabilities and maritime readiness.Key developments include:Awarding of consultancy services for the design and supervision of development works at Khor Jarama, which will bolster maritime utility and preparedness at the site.Tender awards for the rehabilitation of Shannah Port and Masirah Port, intended to modernise and upgrade these facilities for improved service delivery and operational resilience.These efforts reflect the Ministry’s ongoing commitment to ensuring Oman's ports remain competitive, efficient, and equipped for future demand.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

'India like shining Mercedes': Pakistan interior minister echoes Asim Munir's crude analogy - what he said
Pakistan's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi has escalated tensions with India by repeating a controversial analogy made by Army Chief Asim Munir, comparing India to a “shining Mercedes” and Pakistan to a “dump truck.” This statement, initially made during a Saudi delegation visit aimed at de-escalating border tensions, has drawn criticism.

Pakistan's interior minister, Mohsin Naqvi, has stirred tensions with India by echoing a controversial remark made by Army Chief Asim Munir, comparing India to a “shining Mercedes” and Pakistan to a “dump truck.”Naqvi on Sunday quoted Munir as telling the Saudi delegation, “India is like a shining Mercedes, but we are like a dumper truck, loaded with stones; imagine what happens when the two collide.”According to Naqvi, the Army Chief made the statement during the Saudi delegation’s visit to Pakistan, aimed at de-escalating border tensions between the two neighbouring countries, News International reported. He also claimed that none of the missiles fired by India struck Pakistani targets, despite clear evidence.PollDo you agree with Pakistan's Interior Minister's comparison of India and Pakistan?Yes, it highlights the reality.No, it's an inappropriate analogy. India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7-2024 in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, targeting nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and neutralising over 100 terrorists. Tensions flared as both countries exchanged cross-border fire for four days. Indian Air Force Chief Air Chief Marshal AP Singh later confirmed that the Indian Air Force (IAF) shot down six Pakistani aircraft during Operation Sindoor, including five fighter jets and a high-value surveillance platform. He shared satellite imagery and intelligence inputs detailing the extent of damage inflicted on Pakistan’s air fleet and terror infrastructure. Earlier this month, Asim Munir issued a brazen threat to India, stating that Islamabad would take down “half the world" with it if his country faces an existential threat from India in the future. India dismissed his remarks as another example of Islamabad’s “nuclear sabre-rattling" and asserted that New Delhi would not tolerate nuclear blackmail. The central talking point of Munir’s threat was his “crude analogy,” where he described India as a “shining Mercedes” and Pakistan as a “dump truck full of gravel.” “I am going to use a crude analogy to explain the situation," Munir said. “India is shining Mercedes coming on a highway like Ferrari, but we are a dump truck full of gravel. If the truck hits the car, who is going to be the loser?" His remarks were viciously trolled on social media, with users highlighting Munir’s accidental admission of Pakistan’s poor standing compared to India. “Pakistan’s military might is a myth held together by duct tape and delusions," a netizen wrote.

The imagery and messages emphasized her dedication to service and her understated style. Credit: John Swannell for Buckingham Palace/PA Wire Princess Anne turned 75 on August 15. To mark the day, the Prince and Princess of Wales posted a short birthday wish and shared her newly released portrait of the Princess Royal. Their message read, “Wishing Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal a very Happy 75th Birthday!” The image is part of a set released for the milestone. Shot at Gatcombe Park by John Swannell, the portrait keeps the tone formal and restrained—very Anne. Swannell has photographed her across multiple milestone birthdays, a continuity that suits the Princess Royal’s preference for understatement.Image Credit: John Swannell for Buckingham Palace/PA WireThere was also an earlier portrait released the week before: a two-shot of Anne with Sir Tim Laurence, taken at Windsor Castle by Chris Jackson ahead of July’s French state banquet. That image drew attention to a sleeker, pulled-back hairstyle, a look Anne also wore at the banquet with her longtime Festoon Tiara. Photo by Chris Jackson/Getty Images for Buckingham PalaceThe post from William and Kate landed during the family’s summer break, but the message stayed classic: a clear portrait, a brief line, and no long caption. It matches Anne’s public style and allows the picture to do the talking. Prince William & Kate Middleton's ‘Forever Home’ Dream Leaves Neighbours HomelessAs ever, the focus around her birthday was service. Anne is widely cited as one of the monarchy’s hardest-working royals, and official birthday coverage emphasized her decades of engagements and patronages. Family figured in the week’s imagery, too. The Windsor channels highlighted Anne and Sir Tim’s quiet partnership, as well as archival moments from her life—reminders of a career defined by duty, sport and charity more than spectacle. Why does a single post matter? It shows how the Wales household and the Princess Royal present milestones now: warm but minimal, with the visuals carrying the sentiment. For Anne, the emphasis stays on the work rather than the social-media flourish. As the summer break continues, the family is expected to spend time together in Scotland, with no indication of a large public event for the occasion. For the Princess Royal, a steady calendar and a modest celebration remain the norm—and the Waleses’ short message matched that mood. The takeaway: a milestone birthday, a clean portrait, and a brief wish from nephew and niece-in-law—small gestures that say plenty about how Princess Anne works, and how the royal family marks personal events today.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The suspect is now in custody, and authorities have confirmed there is no ongoing threat to the public. AI image A shooting incident in Tremonton, Utah, left at least three police officers injured on Sunday night after a suspect opened fire during a disturbance call. The Brigham City Police Department, which is handling public information on the case, confirmed that the suspect fired at officers responding to the scene near 700 North and 200 East, close to North Park Elementary School, around 9:30 pm (local time), according to Fox 13 Now.Detective Crystal Beck of Brigham City Police told reporters that three officers were shot and later taken to hospital for treatment, though their conditions remain unknown. She also explained that officers had called for backup during the confrontation but eventually stopped responding over their radios.The situation initially caused confusion after Tremonton Mayor Lyle Holmgren posted a statement on Facebook suggesting that two officers had died. Both the city and Holmgren later retracted the claim, with the mayor telling KSL TV’s Alex Cabrero that he could not confirm any details as the scene was still active.The shooting sparked a huge police response, with support from neighbouring law enforcement agencies. As per Newsweek, the suspect was eventually taken into custody and moved to Box Elder County Jail. Authorities confirmed there is no ongoing threat to the public, although residents were asked to stay away from the area. A temporary “shelter in place” order had been issued earlier in the night. Officials also said no civilians were hurt.A local resident, Randy Kidman, described his frightening experience when a stray bullet struck his car. “I thought there was somebody lighting off fireworks,” he was quoted as saying by Fox 13 Now. “I come up the road, and I saw two cop cars and something in the road, and decided it wasn’t a good situation. I went to go back out, and when I went to back out, I caught a bullet through the driver’s side door and it went out my windshield… It’s pretty freaky.”Reported scanner audio from Box Elder County is going viral on social media, which captured the tense exchanges between officers during the incident, including calls for SWAT support and reports of two officers down at the intersection near the school. However, the authenticity of the audio can’t be verified.The name of the suspect has not yet been released.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Ukraine fears ‘repetition of a contentious’ encounter in Oval Office (Picture credit: AP) Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will meet US President Donald Trump in Washington on Monday, with European leaders also joining the talks. As per the Washington Post, the meeting comes amid warnings that it could mirror the “disastrous” Oval Office clash earlier this year that saw relations between Kyiv and Washington plunge.During his last visit to the White House in February, Zelenskyy’s discussions with Trump and Vice President JD Vance ended abruptly after a bitter row. Trump accused him of showing disrespect and of “gambling with World War III.” The joint press conference was cancelled, Zelenskyy was ushered out, and US military aid was briefly frozen. US media described the encounter as “disastrous” and a major diplomatic blow for Ukraine.As per the Washington Post, “Foremost in Ukrainians’ minds is avoiding a repetition of a contentious meeting in the Oval Office”.Nikolay Beleskov, a research fellow at the Ukrainian National Institute for Strategic Studies, was quoted as saying by the Washington Post that there was “such risk indeed” of another tense exchange.He said Zelenskyy must “strike a balance between being non-provocative” while still advancing his demands in Washington.The stakes are particularly high as Trump has just held his first in-person talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin since the Ukraine war escalated in 2022. The Anchorage summit on Friday was labelled “warm” by Trump and “frank” and “substantive” by Putin, according to RT.Following the meeting, Trump suggested that Washington and Moscow were “pretty close to the end” of the conflict and is reportedly considering a plan that would require Kyiv to surrender remaining parts of Donbass in return for a Russian halt in fighting elsewhere, as per RT. Zelenskyy, however, has repeatedly ruled out making territorial concessions.Moscow continues to demand neutrality, demilitarisation and “denazification” of Ukraine, along with recognition of the territories it annexed, Crimea, Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporozhye. Putin had also said the Alaska talks brought the US and Russia “closer” to ending hostilities.The February clash between Trump and Zelenskyy also saw Vance publicly accuse the Ukrainian leader of being “disrespectful” and ungrateful for billions in American aid. The meeting ended without the signing of a minerals agreement that had been central to Zelenskyy’s trip, and Washington temporarily cut off military and intelligence assistance afterwards.Since then, both sides have attempted to repair relations. Trump and Zelenskyy held follow-up meetings in the Vatican in April and at the Nato summit in June, where a minerals deal was eventually signed. Now, with Trump signalling he may provide security guarantees to Ukraine, European leaders, among them UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte and EU chief Ursula von der Leyen, will attend Monday’s discussions to shape the framework for peace talks.As per CNN, JD Vance, a key figure in February’s confrontation, will also be present during the Oval Office meeting.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Kuwait to replace all foreign judges with citizens by 2030 in sweeping workforce nationalization
Kuwait aims to fully nationalize its judiciary by 2030, replacing foreign judges and staff with qualified Kuwaiti professionals. This initiative is part of broader reforms to empower local talent and modernize the legal sector. Similar national workforce integration efforts are underway in vital sectors like oil and technical fields, with stricter recruitment rules for expatriates.

This initiative is part of broader reforms to empower local talent and modernize the legal sector. Similar national workforce integration efforts are underway in vital sectors like oil and technical fields, with stricter recruitment rules for expatriates. Justice Ministry commits to full Kuwaitization of judicial staff by 2030/Image: File Kuwait’s Minister of Justice, Counsellor Nasser Al-Sumait, has confirmed that the country’s judiciary will be fully “Kuwaitized” by 2030, meaning all judicial positions, currently sometimes held by foreign workers will be occupied by qualified Kuwaiti nationals. This initiative forms a core pillar of sweeping reforms to strengthen local talent, empower national professionals, and modernize the legal sector.TL;DR:Kuwait’s judiciary aims to be staffed entirely by citizens by 2030 as part of “Kuwaitization.”The transition is underway across judicial departments, with Legislative reforms also in motion to boost independence and efficiency.Private and public sectors, especially oil and technical fields, are undergoing similar national workforce integration, including strict recruitment and job protection rules.Details of the judicial Kuwaitization driveMinister Al-Sumait states that procedures are already advancing within all judicial departments to replace expatriate judges and staff with skilled Kuwaiti professionals as per a report by People Matters. “The matter has been decided, and we are committed to achieving 100% Kuwaitization by 2030,” he declared, underlining the determination behind the plan. The Ministry of Justice is coordinating closely to ensure that all appointments and promotions prioritize quality, training, and readiness among Kuwaiti candidates.Coupled with the ambitious staffing goal, the Judicial Independence Law is under legislative review intended to secure the judiciary’s autonomy, improve administrative frameworks, and align national structures with contemporary legal best practices. The approach emphasizes not just nationalization, but also efficiency, capability, and global alignment.Kuwaitization across sectorsThe Judiciary initiative follows notable progress in other vital sectors. Kuwait’s oil industry, already Kuwaitized in key engineering and technical roles serves as a model. Local workforce integration in oil is supported by the Manpower Contractors Kuwaitization Initiative (begun in 2002), offering fair wages, benefits, and stable employment for nationals. As of 2024, the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) and subsidiaries have reportedly reached 100% national staffing in top positions, with ongoing efforts to remove barriers for Kuwaitis, ensure job continuity, and phase out reliance on foreign staff.Tightened recruitment for technical & professional rolesThe Public Authority for Manpower has also introduced new, stricter requirements for expatriates seeking technical posts, such as medicine, engineering, law, education, accounting, and finance. All candidates must now pass an online professional proficiency test and undergo thorough academic and work experience verification, typically three to five years via official bodies and Kuwaiti embassies abroad. For existing foreign workers and those switching sectors, changes in job titles or academic records are tightly regulated to ensure only appropriately qualified staff remain.Any roles involving security screening require explicit clearance from the Authority before obtaining Ministry of Interior approval, reinforcing comprehensive compliance and oversight.Kuwait’s sweeping Kuwaitization campaign in the judiciary and beyond seeks to empower Kuwaiti nationals, modernize the labour landscape, and drive sustainable long-term development. Legislative changes, stricter recruitment, and a focus on homegrown talent reflect a national strategy for competitive, capable, and independent institutions across the board.FAQ1. What does Kuwaitization mean in the judiciary context?It means that by 2030, all judicial positions currently held by expatriates will be replaced by qualified Kuwaiti nationals.2. Is the judiciary Kuwaitization process already underway?Yes, the Ministry of Justice is actively implementing the transition across judicial departments.3. What are some legislative reforms accompanying the Kuwaitization plan?The Judicial Independence Law is under review to strengthen the judiciary’s autonomy, efficiency, and alignment with modern legal frameworks.4. Are Kuwaitization efforts limited to the judiciary?No, Kuwaitization is also advancing strongly in sectors like oil, engineering, medicine, and finance, with stricter recruitment and qualification rules for expatriates.5. What new requirements must expatriates meet for technical jobs in Kuwait?Candidates must pass online proficiency tests and undergo rigorous verification of academic credentials and work experience through official authorities.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

This shift comes after criticism of his informal attire during a previous visit to the White House.  In high-stakes meeting between US President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart in Washington, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is likely to show up in more formal attire. According to a designer who earlier collaborated with Zelenskyy told Fox News that he most likely "will not appear in a polo." Ukrainian designer Elvira Gasanova said, "I think he will choose a black military suit or a military-style shirt with trousers — perhaps a jacket."After getting humiliated at the White House earlier for his informal attire, Gasanova said that this time he is likely to choose "a more serious look — though less symbolic.""After the recent ‘no suit’ drama, he will likely approach this question differently," she told Fox News. Earlier in February, the world witnessed a drama after a reporter questioned Zelenskyy over his informal outfit in White House. "Why don't you wear a suit? You're at the highest level in this country's office, and you refuse to wear a suit," one reporter asked. "… Do you own a suit?"Gasanova, who is the founder of Ukrainian fashion brands GASANOVA and DAMIRLI, revealed that Zelenskyy doesn't have a personal stylist, unlike other world leaders.

Using advanced biometric and AI technology, the system automates identity verification in real time, enhancing speed, security, and capacity. This marks a major step toward seamless, document-free travel and next-gen airport experiences. ChatGPT said:Dubai's AI-powered immigration corridor at DXB processes ten passengers at once, enabling seamless, document-free entry using biometric verification/Representative Image  Dubai International Airport has launched a cutting-edge, AI-powered corridor that allows travellers to bypass traditional passport control in seconds. Unveiled by the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA), the new system can process multiple passengers simultaneously—marking a global first in airport immigration technology and advancing Dubai’s vision for seamless, document-free travel.A global first: AI corridor redefines airport clearanceDubai has introduced the world’s first artificial intelligence-powered immigration corridor at Dubai International Airport (DXB), which has retained its title as the busiest international airport for the 11th consecutive year. The initiative was officially announced by Lieutenant General Mohammed Ahmed Al Marri, Director General of the GDRFA.This innovation enables passengers to walk across a special passage—referred to internally as the “red carpet”—to complete immigration formalities without stopping or presenting travel documents. Up to ten passengers can pass through at the same time, a significant improvement over the traditional one-passenger-at-a-time model.The AI corridor is a major step within Dubai’s broader “travel without borders” strategy. It is designed as part of a larger integrated system aimed at providing faster, smoother, and more secure transit for travellers.How the AI corridor works: Speed meets securityThe AI corridor processes passenger information automatically and in real time. Using advanced artificial intelligence, the system identifies and verifies travellers before they reach the immigration checkpoint, allowing them to walk through without presenting ID or stopping for inspection.Despite the speed and simplicity, security is not compromised. The system includes built-in mechanisms that flag any suspicious passports and immediately route them to forgery experts for review. This ensures robust screening while reducing manual workload and queue times.As a result, overall processing capacity has doubled, helping reduce congestion and improving efficiency during high-traffic periods.Enhancing Dubai’s global standingLieutenant General Al Marri highlighted that DXB is not merely a transit point but a prominent international gateway that reflects the UAE’s progressive identity and hospitality. The launch of the AI-powered corridor reinforces Dubai’s standing as a hub of technological innovation and operational excellence.He further stated that the GDRFA’s work aligns with a long-term innovation roadmap that focuses on leveraging technology to modernise and streamline border control procedures. The shift toward automated, document-free travel is expected to become a defining feature of global air travel, with Dubai leading that transformation.Key Features and Operational ImpactSimultaneous ProcessingThe corridor allows up to 10 passengers to pass through at once, significantly accelerating throughput.No Document Requirement Travellers do not need to present passports or ID, as the system uses AI-based identity recognition.Pre-Arrival Data Recognition Passenger data is matched and verified before arrival at the checkpoint, enabling real-time clearance.Automated Security Protocols If irregularities are detected, suspicious documents are automatically flagged and sent to specialist forgery teams.Scalable Infrastructure By increasing efficiency, the corridor is built to support higher passenger volumes during peak times without adding congestion.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

USCIS will take a holistic view of your ‘good moral character’Lubna Kably / TNN / Updated: Aug 17, 2025, 22:47 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLarge  The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has announced a major policy shift that restores a rigorous and holistic approach to evaluating ‘good moral character’ (GMC) of foreign nationals applying for American citizenship.To illustrate: Driving under influence could impair your eligibility, but if you have skipped on taxes – but subsequently coughed up your dues this could be a redeeming factor. Or if you have good educational qualifications and job stability, this too could score you brownie points. The policy memorandum, issued on Aug 15, emphasizes that US citizenship is more than a legal benefit—it represents a profound transformation into active and responsible membership in American society.Trump Outrages World With Unprecedented Travel Ban | 'Racist, Downright Cruel'In fiscal 2024 (year ended Sept 30), 8.18 lakh foreign nationals acquired US citizenship. Mexicans led with as many as 1.07 lakh becoming American citizens (13% of the total), this was followed by Indians, with a little over 49,000 (or 6% of the total) acquiring US citizenship. The trend was similar to earlier years, Indians are the second largest contingent to acquire US citizenship.Going forward, those aspiring to become US citizens will be subjected to the new policy guidelines. Titled – ‘Restoring a rigorous, holistic and comprehensive good moral character evaluation standard for aliens applying for naturalization (citizenship)’, under it USCIS officials will no longer treat GMC as a simple checklist of disqualifying offenses. Instead, they are directed to consider the ‘totality of circumstances’, weighing both negative conduct and positive contributions.The policy highlights that while certain offenses—such as murder, aggravated felonies, torture, or genocide—remain permanent and unconditional bars to naturalization, officials must now also assess evidence of rehabilitation and reformation in other cases.“The regulations and policy affirm that GMC findings must go beyond the absence of disqualifying acts—it must reflect a genuine positive assessment of who the applicant is and how they have lived in their community,” the policy states.Positive attributes and contributions such as sustained community involvement and contributions in the US; family caregiving, responsibility, and ties in the US; educational attainments; stable and lawful employment history and achievements; length of lawful residence in the US, compliance with tax obligations and financial responsibility in the US will carry greater weight. .At the same time USCIS officials will scrutinize behaviours inconsistent with civic responsibility, including repeat driving under influence convictions, false claims to citizenship, unlawful voting, and even patterns of reckless or disruptive conduct.Immigration attorneys are largely of the view that a move away from a rule-based model to a more discretionary one may be a slippery slope. Eligibility results could vary based on the subjective discretion of the official vetting the application and could result in lack of uniformity across cases.In general individuals can apply for US citizenship, after they have been lawful permanent residents (green card holders) for at least five years. A Chicago based Indian family that was examining the possibility of applying for citizenship told TOI, “Years ago, when we initially moved to the US, both of us faced tax disputes owing to interpretation of the India-US tax treaty. This could be a blot on our record.”Loss of jobs during the pandemic and non repayment of interest or principal amount against loans could also be issues that come up for many aspirants during processing of citizenship applications, they point out.However, there appears to be a ray of hope. For applicants with past ‘wrongdoing’ , USCIS officials will look for concrete evidence of rehabilitation, including repayment of taxes, compliance with court-ordered conditions, or testimony from community members. According to the policy guidelines, such evidence may support a finding of good moral character even where negative history exists, provided no permanent bar applies.It may be recalled that Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed as director of USCIS in July, told NY Times in an interview that the current US citizenship test is “too easy”—noting that many applicants can simply memorize answers and pass without true understanding. This is another change that could be on the anvil.About the AuthorLubna KablyLubna Kably is a senior editor, who focuses on various policies and legislation.

A Canadian court has blocked the deportation of Jagjit Singh, an Indian-origin man, citing that his separation from his wife, who has ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder), will cause "irreparable harm" to the wife. According to the court filing, Singh came to Canada in 2021 on a temporary resident visa and made a refugee claim. Then he got married in Canada and his wife applied to sponsor his permanent resident application, and Jagjit Singh withdrew his refugee claim this year.But his removal process already began while his resident application was under review and the Canada Border Services Agency finally ordered him to be deported. Singh appealed to Canada's federal court against the deportation order and claimed that he would be in danger if he were sent back to India.Singh also claimed that his removal would cause "serious prejudices to his spouse due to her health conditions".Federal Judge Avvy Yao-Yao Go said she has evidence in front of her that Singh's wife, referred to as LB in court documents, suffers from ADHD which impairs her ability to manage time and everyday responsibilities. "In the case before me, there is evidence that L.B. suffers from ADHD which impairs her ability to manage time, stress focus and everyday responsibilities and that [Singh] provides her with support by, among other things, helping her maintain daily structure and reminders for medications and appointments, and providing her with emotional stability and mental health support," Go said.The ruling drew backlash on social media, with many users pointing out that ADHD is not that serious. "The judge who halted an Indian man's deportation order because his wife has ADHD was an activist before being appointed to the bench," one wrote. Many social media users said his wife should also go to India with him. "I wonder how his wife survived before she met him?" one person said. "This is beyond insulting. Not only to people with ADHD, but to our country. So pathetic," another wrote.The judge faced backlash for citing his wife’s ADHD as an excuse, with many saying it undermined those who actually suffer from the condition Avvy Yao-Yao Go immigrated to Canada from Hong Kong in the 1980s and worked as Clinic Director of the Chinese and Southeast Asian Legal Clinic before becoming a judge.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

One of the group took his metal water bottle and hit him above the eye, causing heavy bleeding. He was taken to hospital where he received eight stitches. Gardaí confirmed they are investigating the assault and his injuries are “non-life threatening”.An Indian-origin woman has put a post on Reddit saying her 60-year-old father was harassed by boys, aged around seven and eight, who tried to take his wallet at a bus stop in Dublin on Aug 9.These are just the latest in a string of racist attacks targeting Indians in Ireland which have left the Indian community terrified to step outside.India Day in Ireland, which celebrates the country’s cultural ties, has been postponed this Sunday owing to the wave of hate crimes. The event has been organised by the Ireland India Council since 2015. A Ficci India Day event is going ahead in Dublin on Aug 17.Indian community leaders met Ireland deputy PM Simon Harris on Monday after which he condemned the “despicable acts of violence and racism”.Chairman of the Ireland India Council Prashant Shukla told Ireland AM: “We weren’t worried about the event itself as the Gardaí assured us about safety, but we were worried about the perception it could lead to further attacks. Our message to the Irish community is that these attacks are attacks on your economy and industry. Policing needs to go to the next level. I feel there are not proper investigations and arrests. We are all working, paying taxes and contributing to the economy. No one is getting a free house. People are spreading misinformation that Indians buying houses is causing house prices to go up.”President of Ireland Michael D Higgins on Tuesday also condemned the attacks. “A lot of Indians are reconsidering their choices and may move back to India if the situation doesn’t improve. It is mostly being caused by far-right groups encouraging teenagers to attack immigrants. Indians are the most visible immigrants here,” said Indian national Some Aditya Mandal, who has worked in Dublin for eight years.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle10 baby names that mean creativity and visionLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?Maharashtra’s UNESCO World Heritage Sites and other iconic monuments for history loversRajinikanth completes 50 years in cinema: Lesser-known facts about the ‘Coolie’ star6 lizards that prove reptiles can be adorableHow to unrot your brain: 5 effective steps to sharpen focus and boost mental clarityFrom Mullum Malarum to Kabali: Rajinikanth’s most emotional movies that fans still cherish123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

Dr Ajay Aggarwal, an Indian-origin pain medicine doctor from Houston, has agreed to pay over $2 million to resolve allegations of medical fraud against him, the US Justice Department revealed. Between 2021 and 2023, the 63-year-old doctor billed federally funded health care programs like Medicare and the Department of Labor’s Workers’ Compensation Programs for surgical implants that he never performed. Dr Aggarwal received thousands of dollars per procedure, but patients received simple devices which required no surgery. And all device placements used to take place at Aggarwal's clinic, not a hospital or surgical center. “A doctor who uses simple medical devices on his patients, yet bills Medicare for a sophisticated spinal surgery, is billing the American taxpayer, plain and simple,” said US Attorney Nicholas J Ganjei.. “The Southern District of Texas will ensure that losses to federally funded healthcare programs from fraudulent billing, like what happened here, are recouped and that wrongdoers are held accountable.”PollDoes the healthcare billing system need stricter monitoring to prevent fraud?YesNoA 2023 document of the DOJ revealed that earlier he was accused of giving unnecessary treatment to federal employees with federal workers' compensation benefits and his pharmacy Medley, which was officially owned by his wife, filed the prescriptions. An employee of Medley acted as a whistleblower and said that during his term of employment, he saw patients being sent unnecessary with unnecessary medications being prescribed. In some cases, the patients did not even see or meet Dr Aggarwal. And Medley employees were allegedly instructed to auto-fill medications on a monthly basis and to use pre-printed prescription pads to submit the prescriptions to DOL-OWCP without consideration of medical need. The new fraud of Dr Aggarwal came to be reported at a time when foreign doctors are under fire, while several Republican leaders said US needs more doctors and foreign doctors can fill the gap.

Indian-origin foreign nationals holding an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card could now lose it if they face serious criminal charges or convictions, the government has announced.In a fresh gazette notification, the ministry of home affairs said that the OCI registration will be cancelled if the holder is sentenced to imprisonment for two years or more, or is named in a charge sheet for an offence carrying a jail term of seven years or more."In exercise of the powers conferred by the clause (da) of section 7D of the Citizenship Act, 1955 (57 of 1955), the central government hereby states that an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) registration shall be liable to get cancelled when a person has been sentenced to imprisonment for term of not less than two years or has been charge-sheeted for an offence entailing punishment of imprisonment for seven years or more," the notification said, as cited by PTI.PollShould stricter rules be applied to Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) cardholders?NoYesThe OCI card allows Indian-origin foreign nationals to visit India without a visa. The scheme, introduced in August 2005, enables registration as OCI for all persons of Indian origin who were citizens of India on January 26, 1950 or later, or were eligible to become citizens on that date, except for those who are, or have been, citizens of Pakistan, Bangladesh or any other country specified by the government in the official gazette.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Indian-origin Dr Vinay Prasad returns to FDA weeks after exit
Dr Vinay Prasad, previously ousted from his FDA vaccine chief position due to criticism from Laura Loomer over past anti-Trump comments and drug approval decisions, has been reinstated. This unusual move suggests the influence of RFK Jr within the Trump administration despite pressure from right-wing activists.

This unusual move suggests the influence of RFK Jr within the Trump administration despite pressure from right-wing activists. RFK Jr opposed anti-vaxxer Dr Prasad's exit and remained invested to bring him back.  Dr Vinay Prasad is back at his FDA job weeks after exit that was prompted by right-wing activist Laura Loomer's campaigning against Prasad. Dr Vinay Prasad, the Indian-origin vaccine chief of the FDA who was forced to resign in July after far-right activist Laura Loomer led a campaign against him, has been reinstated to his job in an unusual instance. Laura Loomer pointed out the critical comments that Dr Prasad made about President Donald Trump before joining the administration, while some of his decisions to deny drug approvals also came under fire. A Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson confirmed to the New York Times that Dr Prasad is returning to the agency. “At the F.D.A.’s request, Dr. Vinay Prasad is resuming leadership of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research,” Andrew Nixon, a health department spokesman, said in a statement.The NYT report observed that Dr Prasad's rehiring suggests that the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr., and the FDA commissioner, Dr Marty Makary, remain influential enough in the Trump administration to employ someone who had previously expressed disdain for Trump and his followers.Loomer reacted to the reinstatement and called in another "egregious personnel decision". "In another egregious personnel decision under the Trump administration, it is now being reported that longtime progressive Marxist Vinay Prasad who referred to President Trump’s supporters as criminals and compared them to drug addicts after saying he stabbed a Trump voodoo doll to “curse Trump” is apparently back at FDA," Loomer wrote.RFK Jr tapped Dr Prasad in May when the previous head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation left the role. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Dr Prasad gained prominence as an outspoken critic of vaccines and mask mandate. In his short stint at the FDA since May, Dr Prasad limited the use of Covid-19 vaccines and promoted warnings about a rare side effect of the vaccines. When he resigned from his role weeks ago, a department spokesperson told the NYT: "Dr. Prasad did not want to be a distraction to the great work of the FDA in the Trump administration and has decided to return to California and spend more time with his family."Kennedy, however, opposed Prasad's departure from the role and remained invested in bringing him back. Dr Prasad was born and brought up in Ohio and Chicago to Indian immigrant parents.

An Indian-origin techie, Manasi Mishra, who graduated with a computer science degree from Purdue University, revealed in a TikTok video as she was getting ready that the only company that called her for an interview was Chipotle. Titled 'Chipotle Interview GRWM', the TikTok video went viral as she appealed 'somebody pls hire me'. In an interview with New York Times, after the video went viral, Mishra revealed that growing up near Silicon Valley, she was used to the narrative that if she learned to code, worked hard and studied computer science, she could get a six-figure starting salary. But recent graduates are finding it hard because of the spread of AI programming tools and also the recent layoffs at companies like Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft.The NYT story confirmed that Mishra did not get the burrito-making gig at Chipotle, and she finally found a sales position job at a tech company.Mishra's story and the NYT article triggered a major debate on the present job situation, layoff and how much of it should be blamed on foreign workers, AI etc. "This is why I really do feel for Gen Z. This young woman was told her whole life by every authority figure that she should study hard, do well in school, and pursue a career in tech. She went to Purdue, one of the best engineering schools in the country. She studied computer science, not gender ideology or basket weaving," one viral comment read on X. "And still she could not even get a job at Chipotle let alone in her field. She did literally everything “right” but, to what end? This situation is not sustainable. H1B and other work visas, as well as offshoring, are getting out of control and abusive. Policymakers should care about the young generation," the person wrote. Many people commented that the jobs that the Indian-origin person missed must have gone to people from India who are on H-1B.

(Photo: DailyEcho/Padharo) Ankit Vaghela, an Indian-origin restaurant owner in Southampton, was told by the police that they could not come to his 'Padharo' when he called 999 to report a break-in. The vandals broke in and fled with several bottles of expensive alcohol and cash but the police helpline asked them to email the CCTV footage of the three burglars who broke in last week.Vaghela decided to get proactive and review the footage first. He discovered his cash register without the cash, abandoned along with some smashed liquor bottles strewn on a nearby road. “It was very heartbreaking to be told that officers will be able to review the damage in three to five working days and that no forensics was available at the time,” said Vaghela.“There was glass everywhere. As a business, we can’t afford to remain closed and had to get things cleaned up and the glass fixed. We are still struggling to operate smoothly without a proper cash register, which will take time, but are determined to welcome our guests with the same level of service we are known for in the city,” he said.The Hampshire Police said they did not underestimate the July 31 case but they understood that their investigation could start without their immediate attendance at the site, as the offenders were not there. “Every deployment decision is based on informed risk assessments to make sure the most serious cases are prioritised, and officers are on scene where there is an immediate threat to life or a crime in action,” the police force said in a statement.“On this occasion, based on the initial information we were given regarding the offenders no longer being at the scene, our investigation could get underway without any immediate attendance. That investigation is progressing with lines of enquiry identified, such as CCTV, and we are in touch with the victim to provide them updates on our investigation,” added the statement, along with an appeal to the public for any information related to the burglary."It means nothing now, the damage is done. Officers were not willing to visit the restaurant," Vaghela told to local news outlets.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

In a separate incident, Laxman Das, an Indian sous chef in Dublin, was attacked and robbed while going to work. These incidents follow a series of recent assaults targeting Indians in Ireland, raising concerns about racism.  TOI correspondent from London: A six-year-old Indian-origin girl and an Indian sous chef are the latest victims in the ongoing spate of racist attacks targeting Indian nationals and Indian-origin Irish people in Ireland.The girl, whose family hail from Kottayam, Kerala, was playing outside her house in Waterford City, southeast Ireland, with friends at 7.30pm on Monday evening when a gang of boys and one girl called her a “dirty Indian” and told her to “go back to India”. She was born in Ireland. Five of the gang also punched her in the face, hit her private parts with a bicycle, punched her neck and twisted her hair.Her mother moved to Ireland eight years ago from Kottayam to work as a nurse with her husband and recently became an Irish citizen.The mother said the gang was made up of boys aged 12 to 14 and a girl aged eight. She said her daughter came home in floods of tears and is now too scared to play outside. She told the Irish Mirror: “I never expected that such an incident would happen. I thought she would be safe here. Even in front of our own house she can’t play safely. I am a nurse, I am doing my best to take care of people. I do my work and I am 100% professional. I changed my citizenship, but still we are called dirty people and even my kids are not safe. We came here to fill a labour gap. We are professionals — we have all the certificates…”The mother studied BSc Nursing at University of Calicut and went to Mount Carmel Higher Secondary School in Kottayam.“Gardaí (Irish national police) responded to a report of an alleged assault in the Kilbarry area of Waterford city on the evening of Monday 4 August. Investigations are ongoing,” a Garda spokesperson told TOI.On Wednesday morning Laxman Das from Kolkata, who works as a sous chef at the Anantara The Marker Dublin hotel, was assaulted near the Hilton Hotel by three people while on his way to work. He was taken to St Vincent's University Hospital. His phone, cash and electric bike were stolen.These come following a spate of attacks against Indians in Ireland in recent weeks — on July 19, July 24, July 27, and on Aug 1 when a cab driver was assaulted.The Gardaí said they are still investigating these attacks and no one has been arrested.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning looks of Binny Sebastiantv10 baby names that mean ‘divine light’ or ‘sacred glow’Lifestyle10 Birds with the "wildest dating rituals"LifestyleRaksha Bandhan: 10 iconic lines of famous Hindi poets that capture essence of the festivalLifestyleKarishma Tanna Stuns with Style and SpiritEntertainmentFrom Moong to Chia Sprouts: How to grow your breakfast in balconyLifestyleBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Here’s how much each contestant earns dailytv10 creatures that survive in the deepest parts of the oceanLifestyleRaksha Bandhan: 10 quotes that describe the beautiful bond between brothers and sistersLifestyleHow to do step-by-step Ayurveda hair therapy at homeLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Threads of Love, Threads of Tradition: How different Indian states celebrate Raksha BandhanFrom chapatis to cake: 7 delicious ways to use overripe bananasInternational Cat Day 2025: From Persian to Bengal Cat-- 5 most beautiful and popular pet cat breeds in the world5 diseases moles on your body might indicate and should not be ignoredNot-so popular drinks that help in weightloss10 places in South Africa that aren’t to be missed in a lifetimeMemorable style outings of Princess CharlotteHow Kangana Ranaut turned fame into fearless politicsFrom ₹6 Lakh to ₹40 Lakh: A peek into Kamal Haasan’s ultra-luxe watch closetFrom Archana reacting to a hate comment to son Aaryamann revealing how he impressed girlfriend Yogita Bihani: Archana Puran Singh shares candid moments123Hot PicksGlobal Standard indexUS stocks todayIndia-US tariffIntel CEOMukesh AmbaniUS jobless dataRussia crude oilTop TrendingTom BradyDonald TrumpSouth Park EpisodeCall of DutyMalik BeasleyBattlefield 6 Beta OpensPrivate School in IndianaLuka Doncic Weight LossLinda McMahonLakers RumorsTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteUAE launches national programme to train Emiratis in space mission design and satellite engineering'PM Modi can't, shouldn't bend knee to Donald Trump': US tariffs on India draws rare bipartisan concern in US - watch'Enormous mistake': What Trump's former NSA John Bolton said on India tariffChild assault under false identity: Indian man commits suicide in US jail months after 35-year prison sentence, claim reportsLove gone wild: Indian man faces deportation for harassing UK zoo colleague for 6 months; didn’t stop even after restraining order'Before judging...': Wife of Pakistani man Salman Iftikhar who threatened Virgin Atlantic air hostess with gangrape defends outburstFriedrich Merz halts German military exports to Israel over Gaza issue; urges aid accessGround invasion in Gaza?

The arrest occurred due to possession of a fake resident card. Authorities took him into custody in Niagara Falls, New York. He faces a potential 10-year prison sentence. The arrest is part of 'Operation Take Back America'. This initiative targets illegal immigration.  An Indian national has been arrested in the United States for allegedly possessing a forged alien resident card, according to the Justice Department. Swapnil Ramesh Tejale, 34, was taken into custody following a traffic stop in Niagara Falls, New York, and now faces a federal charge that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.“On July 10, 2025, the Niagara Falls Border Patrol Station received a request from the Niagara Falls Police Department to help identify three individuals that they had encountered during a traffic stop,” said Assistant US Attorney Michael J. Smith, who is prosecuting the case. “Agents arrived at the scene and questioned the three individuals as to their citizenship. Tejale presented a Lawful Permanent Resident Card but voluntarily admitted that the card was fictitious.”Authorities later confirmed that Tejale was in the country unlawfully and did not possess any valid immigration documents. Following his arrest, agents discovered a Social Security card in his name, which was also found to be counterfeit.The case falls under “Operation Take Back America”, a Justice Department initiative aimed at tackling illegal immigration and dismantling transnational criminal organisations. The operation seeks to “repel the invasion of illegal immigration” and “protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime”, the department said.The investigation was led by the US Border Patrol Niagara Falls Station, under the direction of Patrol Agent in Charge Brady Waikal.Tejale’s arrest is part of a series of immigration enforcement actions involving Indian nationals this year. In a related incident, an Indian man from Santa Rosa, California, was sentenced in March to six months in prison for conspiracy to transport aliens for profit. Meanwhile, Manjot Singh, a 25-year-old Indian national, was recently arrested in the Seattle area for repeat offences including robbery, assault, and criminal impersonation. Singh, who entered the U.S. illegally, is currently in ICE custody pending deportation.ICE officials have said that Singh’s arrest is a warning to repeat offenders: “Those who violate US laws while in the country illegally face arrest and deportation.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Viral footage shows firefighters inspecting the scene as the family performed the ritual. (Photo: X) A housewarming ceremony involving a Hindu havan at a Texas home took an unexpected turn when local firefighters arrived at the scene, mistaking the ritual for a fire emergency.The incident was captured on video. The footage has gone viral and has fuelled an online debate over cultural awareness and fire safety. The clip was originally shared on Instagram. It shows a fire truck from the Bedford fire department pulling up outside the house as smoke from the ceremony fills the garage. Inside, an Indian family can be seen performing a traditional havan, a religious ritual involving fire, as part of their housewarming puja.The video includes on-screen text stating, "Cultural misunderstanding 101: A Hindu puja is not a fire emergency. When you're having a housewarming havan and the fire department pulls up."Shortly after the fire crew arrives, they are seen speaking with members of the family and inspecting the area. However, it remains unclear whether any formal action was taken or if any fire codes were violated during the ritual.The footage has since been widely circulated across social media platforms, with users offering differing views on the incident. Some social media users criticised the family for conducting a ritual involving fire in a residential setting, arguing it could pose safety risks. Others defended the family’s right to observe their religious customs, calling the incident a clear example of cultural misunderstanding.No official comment was immeditaely released by the Bedford fire department.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Indian-origin Mathura Sridharan was appointed as Ohio's 12th solicitor general, inviting the wrath of online trolls who questioned why a 'non-US-origin' person was not picked for the post. Sridharan's LinkedIn went viral as critics questioned her credibility -- forcing Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost to issue a clarification, or a clapback at the trolls. Dave Yost, who announced Mathura's promotion, said Mathura is wrongly being portrayed as a non-American. "A few commenters have asserted incorrectly that Mathura is not American. She is a United States citizen, married to a US citizen, and the child of naturalized US citizens," he said. "If her name or her complexion bother you, the problem is not with her or her appointment," he added."Mathura is brilliant… she won her argument at SCOTUS last year. Both the SGs she worked under (Flowers & Gaiser) recommended her. I told her when I originally hired her I needed her to argue with me. She does… All the time! Excited to promote her. She will serve Ohio well," Yost wrote.Yost's clapback also met trolling as people commented that she is not "American-American". "Is she a Christian? That’s the biggest factor that concerns me. Based on the bindi on her forehead, I worry she is not," one wrote. "Another American job… given away to foreigners," another wrote. "She's Indian. They all have a loyalty first to other Indians. horrible pick. Totally un-American. the GOP is pathetic," a third user wrote."No one with the last name 'Sridharan' fought in the US Civil War. She's not an American," another wrote.Before joining the Ohio Solicitor’s Office, Mathura clerked for Judge Steven J. Menashi of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and Judge Deborah A. Batts of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. She holds a Juris Doctor from New York University School of Law, a Master’s Degree in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as a Bachelor’s Degree in Economics and in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

News organizations like New Zealand Herald, Radio New Zealand, and 1News cited their inability to moderate the hateful content as the reason for shutting down comments.   After Indian-origin Nikhil Ravishankar was appointed as the new chief executive of Air New Zealand, the country's media said they had to disable comments on social media as there was a barrage of racist remarks targeting Ravishankar's ethnicity. Ravishankar was the chief digital officer of Air New Zealand before getting the major promotion which is the first for an Indian-origin person in the country.New Zealand Herald, Radio New Zealand, 1News said they had to disable comments as they can't allow hatred. The New Zealand Herald issued a statement in which it clarified that there were several racist comments owing to which they had to take the extreme step. "We appreciate the high level of interest in this story but cannot safely moderate it at this time," the news outlet said in a post in the comment thread."We want to foster a safe online community by reducing instances of hate, racism, abuse and misinformation. We welcome your feedback on articles but there has to be some parameters, and these are explained in our community house rules...We cannot tolerate hate. We cannot tolerate abuse towards individuals in our stories or other commenters," the company's social media policy says. Radio New Zealand had to do the same on the social media post on Ravishankar's appointment. "Under RNZ's comments policy, we will proactively disable comments on posts which may attract abusive or harmful comments or when resources are required elsewhere," a spokesperson for RNZ said. "In this instance, the comments were disabled after our monitoring found racist comments," the spokesperson said. "We want people to feel safe and respected on our community forums and will continue to proactively disable comments where necessary. We will not tolerate harmful communications."1News said it received a large number of comments on the post that announced Ravishankar's appointment and a vast majority were inappropriate. Who is Nikhil Ravishankar?Nikhil Ravishankar was born in India but brought up in New Zealand. He studied in New Zealand -- holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) from the University of Auckland. Before joining Air New Zealand, Ravishankar was Chief Digital Officer at Vector New Zealand (from 2017), and also worked as a Managing Director at Accenture across Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand, and in senior technology roles at Spark (formerly Telecom NZ).About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

And I said, 'Taco Bell?' And the guy who was working said, 'Yeah, Taco Bell. Ma'am, you called me," Chatterjee recalled."I was in such disbelief," she said. "So, I called the ICE officer back, just really frustrated with what had just happened. He says, 'Oh, I'm sorry. I was trying to lighten the mood and make you laugh.'"ICE has denied the accusation. Homeland security called it a “lie and a smear.” Chatterjee stood by her version of events.Who is Trisha Chatterjee? Trisha Chatterjee is an Indian-origin immigration lawyer based in Greater Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio. She graduated from Miami University in 2020 and the University of Dayton School of Law in 2023.She works with the law office of Emily Feliz Garcia, a small immigration firm in Springdale. Before this, she worked at Abdallah law offices.For the last two years, she has handled immigration cases, especially those involving clients detained at the Butler County Jail in Ohio, which has a contract with ICE.Chatterjee was trying to submit "stay of removal" applications—urgent paperwork that can pause deportation for clients with pending immigration cases. ICE requires these to be submitted in person at the Detroit field office, but she hoped to file them locally in Blue Ash.After being unable to reach anyone by phone or email, she finally spoke to an ICE officer who gave her a phone number that turned out to be for Taco Bell. When she called back, the officer reportedly said he was trying to make her laugh.She posted a video about the incident on TikTok, which gained over 38,000 views. Many users sympathised, and one even helped her connect with a helpful ICE official in Blue Ash, who is now assisting her.Chatterjee said the larger problem is the lack of access and communication with ICE. She also highlighted how a stricter bond policy is making it harder for immigrants to stay out of detention during legal proceedings. Bonds can cost up to $50,000 and must be paid upfront.According to Chatterjee, some clients are abandoning their asylum cases or choosing to self-deport out of fear. She mentioned recent local arrests of people attending ICE check-ins, which has only deepened anxiety in immigrant communities.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Zohran Mamdani under fire over past ‘defund the NYPD’ remarks; shifts stance after visiting fallen NYC officer's family; old posts resurface online
Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani faces criticism for visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam due to his past support for defunding the police. Critics accuse Mamdani of shifting his stance for political gain, especially after his 2020 tweets resurfaced.

Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani faces criticism for visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam due to his past support for defunding the police. Critics accuse Mamdani of shifting his stance for political gain, especially after his 2020 tweets resurfaced. Mamdani defends his actions, clarifying his current position on public safety and police funding. Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is facing backlash after visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam, as critics pointed to his past 2020 tweet supporting "defund the police" stance.The controversy erupted after Mamdani, who recently returned from a trip to Uganda, visited the grieving family of officer Islam, one of four victims killed in a mass shooting in Midtown Manhattan. Zohran Mamdani’s SECRET Wedding Triggers Fury Amid Local Tragedy | WATCHThe shooter, Shane Tamura, opened fire on Monday, killing Islam and three others before shooting himself.Sharing a post on X, Mamdani wrote: “Two days ago, an act of senseless violence took the lives of Officer Didarul Islam, Wesley LePatner, Aland Etienne, and Julia Hyman. Today, I visited Officer Islam's family and learned of his legacy. I ask you to join me in honoring the memory of these four New Yorkers.”However, the post quickly drew criticism, with users referencing Mamdani’s previous tweets during the height of the “Defund the Police” movement in 2020.Many accused him of changing his stance for political gain. One user wrote, “You can't go from defund the police to never mind I love the police. You're asking New Yorkers to forgo their guns meanwhile you just had a wedding in Uganda with armed guards.”While another posted, “Zohran Mamdani exposed as a total fraud. Mocking cops, calling them racist, then acting like he cares? No loyalty to America. He belongs in Uganda, not leading NYC. Deport him and protect our city!”Earlier at a press conference following his visit to the officer’s home in The Bronx, Mamdani addressed the criticism and attempted to clarify his position saying: “I am not defunding the police; I am not running to defund the police.”“Over the course of this race, I’ve been very clear about my view of public safety and the critical role that the police have in creating that public safety,” he added.Standing alongside members of the Bangladeshi American Police Association—of which Officer Islam was a member—and labor union 32BJ, which represented another victim, Aland Etienne, Mamdani tried to strike a unifying tone.During the peak of the "Defund the Police" movement in 2020, Zohran Mamdani repeatedly called for major cuts to the NYPD budget. In one post, he wrote, “We don’t need an investigation to know that the NYPD is racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety. What we need is to #DefundTheNYPD.”In another, he said, “There is no negotiating with an institution this wicked & corrupt. Defund it. Dismantle it. End the cycle of violence,” referencing budget talks around proposed NYPD cuts.Now, Mamdani has distanced himself from those remarks. When asked about them, he responded, “My statements in 2020 were made amidst a frustration that many New Yorkers held at the murder of George Floyd.”Mamdani claimed that his current stance is more nuanced, stating that his previous posts were “clearly out of step” with his recent campaign platform. He now supports maintaining the NYPD headcount while reducing its overtime budget.Despite this clarification, skepticism remains. Many police officers and political observers have accused Mamdani of shifting positions purely for political gain in a city where public safety remains a top concern for voters, New York Post reported.Adding to the political firestorm, former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams, who are both trailing Mamdani in early polling for the 2025 mayoral race, weighed in shortly after the shooting. Mamdani fired back, accusing Cuomo of politicising the tragedy saying, “It is beyond me that politicians are looking to use these days to score such cynical political points, on the very day that I held the father of Officer Islam in my arms and he could not utter a single word.”“For the former governor to spend an entire day speaking almost exclusively about me and barely about the New Yorkers who have been killed is indicative of the very politics New Yorkers want to leave in the past,” he added.All three, Mamdani, Cuomo, and Adams are expected to attend officer Islam’s funeral on Thursday.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The high court found him guilty of rape and outrage of modesty, following incidents at his Jurong West shop in 2021. Despite his denials and claims of erectile dysfunction, the judge deemed the victim's testimony credible.  An Indian national was sentenced to more than 14 years in jail on Thursday by the Singapore high court for sexually assaulting a minor, reports the Straits Times.Ramalingam Selvasekaran was handed a sentence of 14 years, three months and two weeks after being found guilty of rape and two counts of outrage of modesty after assaulting an 11-year-old at his provision shop in Jurong West.According to the court, the assaults occurred between 4.50 pm and 5.05 pm on October 28, 2021. The girl had visited Ramalingam’s store and returned later to buy ice cream. Prosecutors said he led her into a back area and forced her to perform oral sex. After the incident, the girl sought help from a passerby, who called the police.Ramalingam represented himself during the trial, which began on January 16. He was convicted on all charges on 7 July.“The fact that she had not run off after the first act of molest, or that she did not resist the assaults, or inform her grandfather, were all to my mind sufficiently explained, particularly given that she was still young and immature,” said Justice Aidan Xu, who found the girl’s account credible and consistent.Ramalingam’s earlier statements to police reportedly included admissions of hugging, kissing, and oral sex. However, he later denied any wrongdoing, claiming he was suffering from erectile dysfunction and that no DNA evidence was found on the victim.The judge ruled that these claims did not undermine the girl’s testimony. “While there was no dispute that Ramalingam suffered from erectile dysfunction, the prosecution’s expert witness gave a cogent explanation that oral rape remained possible,” Justice Xu was quoted as saying to Straits Times.Following sentencing on July 30, Ramalingam said he would appeal and was granted bail of S$80,000. He attempted to negotiate with the judge over the conditions, asking for the removal of his electronic tag and exemption from reporting to the Police Cantonment Complex. Both requests were denied.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The selection decision remains complex due to India's packed top-order batting lineup and scheduling challenges, with multiple players vying for limited spots.   Gill has already established himself as a formidable force in ODIs, accumulating 2,775 runs and 22 fifty-plus scores in 55 matches. Reports suggest he could potentially return to the T20I team as vice-captain and might be in line for ODI leadership once current captain Rohit Sharma retires.   In his most recent T20 appearance during IPL 2025, Gill demonstrated his prowess by scoring 650 runs at a strike rate of nearly 156, including six fifties in 15 matches, finishing as the fourth-highest run-getter.   Gill's T20I career has shown steady improvement. He concluded 2024 with 266 runs in eight T20Is at an average of 38.00 and a strike rate of 133, including two fifties during the Zimbabwe series. His overall T20I statistics stand at 578 runs in 21 matches at an average of 30.42 and a strike rate exceeding 139.   The scheduling complexity poses a significant challenge for selectors. The Asia Cup final concludes on September 28, with home Tests against West Indies beginning October 2. This tight schedule requires careful consideration in team selection.   India's T20I performance has been remarkable since their T20 World Cup victory, winning 17 out of 20 bilateral series. During Gill's absence, several players have strengthened their positions in the team.   Abhishek Sharma has particularly impressed, scoring 279 runs against England with a strike rate of 220, including a spectacular 135 off 54 balls at Wankhede. Since the last T20 World Cup, he has amassed 1,363 runs in 42 matches at an average of 34.94 and a strike rate exceeding 198.   Tilak Varma has also shown consistent performance, scoring 1,200 runs in 36 matches at an average of 50.00 and a strike rate of 153.84 since the last T20 World Cup. He recorded two centuries during the South Africa tour.   Sanju Samson has reinvented himself as an opener alongside Abhishek, scoring 908 runs in 31 T20s at an average of 33.62 and a strike rate of 157.09 since the last T20 World Cup.   Captain Suryakumar Yadav has contributed 1,107 runs in T20s at an average of 36.90 and a strike rate of 161.13, though his international form has declined recently.   Gill's recent T20 statistics remain impressive, with 893 runs in 22 matches at an average of 47.00 and a strike rate over 147 since the last T20 World Cup.   Yashasvi Jaiswal, who like Gill last played T20I in July 2024, presents another strong candidacy with 723 runs in 23 T20Is, including a century and five fifties at a strike rate exceeding 164.   The current Samson-Abhishek opening combination makes it challenging to accommodate both Gill and Jaiswal in the playing XI. With a 15-member squad limit for the Asia Cup and World Cup, selecting all four players - Abhishek, Samson, Gill, and Jaiswal - appears unlikely, considering the need for backup players in other roles.   The final selection may come down to choosing between Jaiswal and Gill, with Samson holding an advantage as a wicketkeeper-batsman. The selectors will need to evaluate who can make a more significant impact in the upcoming tournaments. 18:32 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Will Shreyas Iyer feature in the squad?With Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, and Axar Patel already assured of their middle-order roles, India still has room for two — possibly even three or more batting spots to fill.At No. 3, the battle is shaping up between Tilak Varma, who currently holds the position, and Shreyas Iyer. Shreyas had a standout IPL 2025 with Punjab Kings, striking at 175.07 — the third-best in IPL history for a season with 600 or more runs, behind only Chris Gayle (2011) and Suryakumar (2023). His ability to take on spin adds further weight to his case.18:12 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Too many options? India selectors face a happy headacheIndian selectors are spoilt for choices ahead of a big T20 season, thanks to extensive IPL scouting, which has broadened the player pool. This allows a shift in gears for the format. The focus is on identifying impactful players who can perform consistently under pressure, with IPL performances heavily influencing selection decisions.READ FULL STORY17:30 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: EXCLUSIVE | Harbhajan Singh: 'Don't underestimate Shubman Gill, he can dominate T20Is too'With the Asia Cup 2025 squad set to be announced, Harbhajan Singh has backed Shubman Gill for inclusion despite stiff competition from India’s power-hitters.

Suryavanshi's impressive IPL 2025 performance and U19 tour of England have made him a strong contender. Srikkanth emphasizes Suryavanshi's maturity and shot-making ability, urging selectors to consider him for the upcoming T20 World Cup.READ FULL STORY16:47 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Sanju Samson under pressure?Sanju Samson has had a good run so far as an opener in T20s under Gautam Gambhir and Suryakumar Yadav, scoring three centuries at the top of the order. However, his last series against England was not very encouraging, as he managed only 51 runs and repeatedly fell to the short ball against Jofra Archer. If he starts as an opener again, he will be under some pressure.15:27 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Does Shubman Gill warrant a spot in India's T20 setup?Shubman Gill's Test success has sparked debate about his T20 inclusion and potential leadership role, despite his batting style not aligning with the team's aggressive approach. While his ODI place is secure, fitting him into the T20 side, which prioritizes high-strike-rate hitters like Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson, seems forced.READ FULL STORY15:01 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Harsha Bhogle names his picks for India squadHarsha Bhogle, on his YouTube channel, has named his picks for India’s T20I squad, with Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma, skipper Suryakumar Yadav, Shreyas Iyer and opener Sanju Samson featuring among the specialist batters. Samson is also Bhogle’s first-choice wicketkeeper, with Jitesh Sharma as backup. Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, and Washington Sundar form the all-round core, while Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh and Prasidh Krishna headline the pace attack.14:02 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Squad shaping upApart from Bumrah, the pace unit could feature Arshdeep Singh, Prasidh Krishna/Harshit Rana, and Hardik Pandya. Spinners Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, and Washington Sundar are near certainties. Jitesh Sharma is tipped to join as the backup wicketkeeper.13:50 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Bumrah Back, Siraj restedPacer Jasprit Bumrah has declared himself fit and will spearhead India’s attack in the UAE. Mohammed Siraj, however, is likely to be rested after a draining England Test series.13:43 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Iyer in TroubleDespite guiding Punjab Kings to the IPL final and being India’s top run-getter in the Champions Trophy, Shreyas Iyer faces stiff competition from power-hitters Shivam Dube and Rinku Singh.13:05 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Jaiswal’s case weakenedThough Yashasvi Jaiswal’s power-hitting makes him an attractive option, he’s reportedly been asked to focus on red-ball cricket, with four home Tests lined up in 2025-26.13:00 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Samson, Abhishek & Tilak the chosen trioThe likely top order: Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma to open, Tilak Varma at No.3, Suryakumar Yadav at No.4. All three are in rich T20I form, with Samson smashing three T20I tons in 2024 and Varma hitting back-to-back centuries vs South Africa.12:54 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Shubman Gill facing omission?Despite a dream Test tour of England (754 runs @75.40) and a stellar IPL 2025 (650 runs @155.87 SR), Gill may not find a place in the Asia Cup squad.

With Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Ravindra Jadeja retired from T20Is, India will enter the UAE tournament with a fresh look and new leadership options.08:59 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: R Ashwin on Asia Cup squadFormer Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has shared his insights on key selection decisions ahead of the upcoming Asia Cup 2025 squad announcement by Indian selectors on Tuesday, August 19. The T20I tournament, scheduled in the UAE from September 9-28, will see India compete in Group A alongside Pakistan, UAE, and Oman, with the event being viewed as a crucial testing ground for India's T20I core ahead of next year's T20 World Cup.The selection committee faces important decisions regarding the opening batting positions for the tournament. With Rohit Sharma's absence confirmed, the competition for opening slots has intensified between players like Shubman Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and Sanju Samson."There are a few talking points regarding the Asia Cup. The first question that comes to everyone's mind is whether Shubman Gill fits into the T20 plans because in the last World Cup, Yashasvi Jaiswal was the backup opener," Ashwin said on his YouTube channel. "So Jaiswal automatically gets a kick-in. Rohit Sharma is not going to be a part of that team, so Jaiswal automatically gets a look-in. Now, who is going to be that other opener?"The selection scenario is further complicated by the recent performances of multiple players vying for spots in the team. Gill's impressive recent Test series performance and Samson's success as a T20 opener have created additional considerations for the selectors."Shubman Gill had an outstanding series. Can he return to the squad? Sanju Samson has had a fabulous run as a T20 opener for India. So I think it is a tricky state for the selectors," Ashwin explained.The selection committee must also consider the potential return of Shreyas Iyer to the squad. "Can Shreyas Iyer make a comeback? There is a lot of decision-making that the selectors have to make," Ashwin remarked.08:53 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Pakistan squadSalman Ali Agha (captain), Abrar Ahmed, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Hasan Nawaz, Hussain Talat, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Haris (wicket-keeper), Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Waseem Jnr, Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, Salman Mirza, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Sufyan Moqim.08:45 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Gill vs Jaiswal – the final selection battle?Yashasvi Jaiswal, who last played a T20I in July 2024, has 723 runs in 23 matches at a strike rate of 164+, including a century. With only 15 squad spots available, selectors may have to choose between Gill and Jaiswal, with Samson holding an edge as a keeper-batter.08:44 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Samson-Abhishek partnership complicates mattersSanju Samson has reinvented himself as Abhishek’s opening partner, scoring 908 runs at a strike rate of 157 since the last T20 World Cup. With Samson also doubling as a wicketkeeper, his inclusion strengthens India’s balance, making it harder for both Gill and Jaiswal to fit in.08:44 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Abhishek Sharma emerging as front-runnerAbhishek Sharma’s explosive form is making him hard to ignore. Against England, he hammered 279 runs at a strike rate of 220, including a 135 off 54 balls at Wankhede. Since the last T20 World Cup, he has scored 1,363 runs at a strike rate nearing 200.08:43 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Gill’s T20I numbers back his claimShubman Gill has scored 578 runs in 21 T20Is at a strike rate of 139+, including two fifties in 2024. Since the last T20 World Cup, he has amassed 893 runs at an average of 47 and a strike rate over 147. His IPL 2025 form was also strong, with 650 runs at a strike rate of 156.08:42 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Gill under consideration despite packed scheduleShubman Gill, India’s newly-appointed Test captain, is being considered for the T20 Asia Cup starting September 9. However, selectors face a dilemma due to India’s crowded top-order and the tight scheduling, with Tests against West Indies beginning just four days after the Asia Cup final.08:41 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: WelcomeHello and welcome to our live coverage of the Asia Cup squad announcement. The Asia Cup will be played in the UAE from September 9-28, with India scheduled to open their campaign against the hosts on September 10, while the marquee fixture against arch-rivals Pakistan is slated on September 14, both in Dubai.We will be bringing you all the live updates. Stay tuned.India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Ahead of the Ajit Agarkar-led selection panel's meeting to pick India's Asia Cup squad, all eyes will be on Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal, whether the two explosive batters will find a place in India's Asia Cup squad. 

The Asia Cup will be played in the UAE from September 9-28, with India scheduled to open their campaign against the hosts on September 10, while the marquee fixture against arch-rivals Pakistan is slated on September 14, both in Dubai.

If all are fit and available, Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson (batter-keeper), Tilak Varma, skipper Surya Kumar Yadav and Hardik Pandya are automatic selections in top-five.

Now with Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal, two players with proven IPL records are back in the mix, the selectors will have to make some compromise with regards to one or two slots.

And this is pretty clear that at least in this Asia Cup, both Gill and Jaiswal wouldn't be in the same squad till Abhishek and Sanju are automatic choices.

India are placed along with arch-rivals Pakistan in Group A, also featuring the UAE and Oman, in the eight-team Asia Cup tournament which will be held from September 9 to 28.TrendingSuryakumar YadavSaaniya ChandhokMS DhoniShahid AfridiIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementGautam GambhirVirat KohliCincinnati Open Final Live StreamingKedar JadhavR AshwinSuryakumar YadavSaaniya ChandhokMS DhoniShahid AfridiIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementGautam GambhirVirat KohliCincinnati Open Final Live StreamingKedar JadhavR AshwinSuryakumar YadavSaaniya ChandhokMS DhoniShahid AfridiIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementGautam GambhirVirat KohliCincinnati Open Final Live StreamingKedar JadhavR AshwinTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTop Stories Right NowAsia Cup 2025: Suryakumar Yadav to stay as India’s T20I captain, Shubman Gill li...Cricket | 'Ek banda fail hue ja raha hai 3, 4, 5 saal...' - Irfan Pathan backs G...Blast from the past: Arjun Tendulkar’s fiancée Saaniya Chandhok spotted in old v...More TOP StoriesQuick LinksWTC Points TableNHL NewsNBA NewsEsports and Gaming NewsLatest Cricket NewsWWE NewsCricket Match ScheduleInternational SportsMLB NewsNFL NewsEducation NewsLive Cricket ScoreExplore Every CornerAcross The GlobeIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementTravis KelceRussell Wilson WifeDwyane Wade WifeVanessa BryantLebron JamesMumbai RainsAuston MatthewTravis Hunter WifeLeanna LeneeWWE RAW PreviewCraig BerubeTrump Zelenskyy MeetingSamuel MontembeaultWayne GretzkyCaleb WilliamsSpencer RattlerSophie Cunningham InjuryChris BoswellDeng MayarCP Radhakrishnan Educational QualificationHangor-class submarineITR Filing 2025Bank Holidays AugustGSTFlorida turnpike accidentBrooklyn shootingMumbai RainsQantas AirwaysConnor McDavidAbout usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesLiving and EntertainmentCricbuzzLifestyleNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTVTimes PrimeTravel DestinationsWhats HotETimesTimes LifeTimes PetsMyLifeXPServicesCouponDuniaTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgetsTimes EventsWork with UsColombiaHot on the WebCloves Health BenefitsTulsi Health BenefitsBlood Pressure ManagementLow CholesterolKidney Disease SymptomsLongest International RiverGuava Health BenefitsLow Value CurrencyHome Aquarium Setup GuideFoods That Weaken BonesKidney Cancer SymptomsJaved AkhtarArmaan MalikShah Rukh KhanHrithik RoshanAnushka SharmaAjithLiver Disease SymptomsColon Cancer SymptomsMonsoon Snake PreventionJessica RadcliffeCobra Safety TipsWar 2 Box Office CollectionNational Couples Day WishesCoolie Movie ReviewCoolie Box Office CollectionMahavatar Narsimha Box Office CollectionKapil SharmaSaiyaara Box Office CollectionDarshan ThoogudeepaSaiyaara Movie ReviewColon Cancer SymptomsSanskrit EffectNatural SupplementsHigh Cholesterol SymptomsSide Effects Of Dragon FruitColorectal CancerOral SymptomsReduce Face Fat DietSide Effects Of BananasGinger Tea Side EffectsKidney Damage SymptomsTrending TopicsSunil GavaskarSchool Holidays ListRinku SinghJannik Sinner vs Carlos AlcarazArjun TendulkarShubman GillJKBOSE Bi Annual ExamRajasthan PTET Seat AllotmentPSSSB Group B RecruitmentSuryakumar YadavIGNOU July RegistrationCBSE CTET NotificationBSSC CGL 4 RecruitmentShah Rukh KhanNeymar JRKedar JadhavGautam GambhirJaved MiandadTN NEET UG Seat AllotmentMumbai RainsMeerut Army Jawan AssaultedDelhi Bomb ThreatJabalpur Bank RobberyBengaluru Assault NewsDelhi RapeManisha Murder CaseMumbai Heavy RainfallHyderabad Janmashtami NewsBhopal RapeMumbai RainfallParag AgrawalFastag Annual PassSam AltmanGeoffrey HintonSridhar VembuApple iPhone 17Nyt ConnectionsMega Tsunami WarningGithub CeoJamie DimonWordle TodaySteve JobsPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth+ TipsIndian TV ShowsTechnologyTravelEtimesHealth & FitnessNFLAugust Long Weekend 2025India vs EnglandAstrologyWeather TodayPlatinum Rate TodaySilver Rate TodayGold Rate TodayIs Bank open todayIs Bank Open TomorrowBank Holidays in AugustPublic Holidays in AugustStock Market HolidaysFinancial CalculatorsTechnology NewsInternational SportsPublic HolidaysBank HolidaysLatest NewsTop 5 entertainment news: Larissa Bonesi calls Aryan Khan 'unstoppable', Sunjay Kapur's sister praises Karisma Kapoor, Virat Kohli-Anushka Sharma chat with locals in London3 things parents can do if your child is burnt outYeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai: Maira questions why Abhira can’t marry Armaan againBanking-TieUp: BoM, SBI Card launch co-branded credit card;

Kris Srikkanth, former India captain, has surprisingly advocated for 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi's inclusion in the Asia Cup T20 squad. Suryavanshi's impressive IPL 2025 performance and U19 tour of England have made him a strong contender. Srikkanth emphasizes Suryavanshi's maturity and shot-making ability, urging selectors to consider him for the upcoming T20 World Cup.

RR's Vaibhav Suryavanshi celebrates his fifty (PTI Photo/Manvender Vashist Lav) Former India captain Kris Srikkanth has advocated for 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi's inclusion in India's 15-member squad for the upcoming Asia Cup T20, starting September 9. Srikkanth's endorsement comes as selectors prepare to finalize the squad on August 19, amid intense competition for spots, particularly in the opening positions.Vaibhav Suryavanshi has emerged as a strong contender following his performance in IPL 2025, where he scored 252 runs in seven matches for Rajasthan Royals at a strike rate exceeding 200. He also claimed the second-fastest century in IPL history, reaching the milestone in 35 deliveries against Gujarat Titans.Everything is special about Vaibhav Suryavanshi: Vikram RathourGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!The young prodigy continued his impressive form during the U19 tour of England, scoring a century and delivering strong performances in both one-day and four-day formats."You have to play bold. Don't make him wait. Don't say things like 'let him mature'. He is already playing with remarkable maturity. His shot-making has been on another level. If I were chairman, I would definitely have him in the squad," Srikkanth stated on his YouTube show.The selection discussion involves several established players, including Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson, who have secured their positions with an aggressive approach under coach Gautam Gambhir. Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill and current IPL Orange Cap holder Sai Sudharsan are also in contention.Srikkanth expressed uncertainty about Sanju Samson's inclusion in the squad and outlined his preferred opening combinations."Samson is doubtful, according to me," Srikkanth said. "My first-choice opener is Abhishek Sharma, no doubt. I will have two more openers. My picks would be Vaibhav Suryavanshi or Sai Sudharsan, with Shubman Gill as an option. If I were a selector, I would keep Vaibhav in the 15 for the T20 World Cup. He has been outstanding."PollShould Vaibhav Suryavanshi be included in India's squad for the Asia Cup T20?Yes, absolutely!No, he should wait."I think it should be Yashasvi Jaiswal, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, and Sai Sudharsan. I would take two out of these three. That would be my preference," he added.Since the T20 World Cup final in June 2024, Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson have been India's leading run-scorers in T20 internationals. Both players have received support from the team management, including head coach Gambhir and captain Suryakumar Yadav, for their aggressive batting style.Abhishek has accumulated 535 runs at an average of 33.43 with a strike rate of 193.84, including two centuries during this period. Samson has scored three hundreds in 17 matches at a strike rate of 171.47.However, Samson's recent performance in the five-match series against England has raised concerns. He struggled against short-pitched bowling and recorded three single-digit scores in five innings.Srikkanth, who previously captained a 16-year-old Sachin Tendulkar during his debut in Pakistan in 1989, believes India should not delay incorporating Vaibhav into the national setup as they prepare for next year's T20 World Cup.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

India's player of the series India's captain Shubman Gill on day five of the fifth cricket test match between England and India at The Kia Oval in London, Monday, Aug. 4, 2025. (AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) NEW DELHI: The Asia Cup 2025 India squad is set to be announced, and the burning question is whether Test captain Shubman Gill will find a place in the team. With India’s T20I batting lineup already packed with hard-hitters like Abhishek Sharma, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson, Tilak Varma, captain Suryakumar Yadav, and Hardik Pandya, the selectors face a “sweet headache” when it comes to Gill’s inclusion.India’s top six T20I batters boast impressive strike rates: Abhishek Sharma (193.84), Suryakumar Yadav (167.07), Yashasvi Jaiswal (164.31), Hardik Pandya (141.67), Tilak Varma (155.07), and Sanju Samson (152.38).Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!In comparison, Gill has played 21 T20Is so far, with a strike rate of 139.27.So, will the selectors still back Shubman?Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh, who has closely observed Gill, strongly believes the youngster deserves a place in the squad.“In the T20 format, it’s important to understand that it’s not just about big hitting. If Shubman decides to attack, he can match anyone, because he is a very solid player with strong basics. A batter with such a strong foundation can score runs in any format," Harbhajan told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview."If you look at the IPL, Shubman has scored runs every season. He has worn the Orange Cap — and that doesn’t happen by chance. And it’s not like he bats only at a strike rate of 120 or 130; he can also bat at a strike rate of 160," he added."Yes, we do have players like Abhishek Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, and Tilak Varma, but you cannot undermine or underestimate Shubman Gill. He is a very talented batter who can adapt to any format. He is an all-format player. In my opinion, he can play T20s and even dominate the format. We as fans are used to seeing fours and sixes every ball, but you also need batters who can play long innings and rescue the team when required,” Harbhajan said.When asked to name his 15 for the Asia Cup, which is set to be picked on Tuesday, Harbhajan replied: "I think the squad should be: Yashasvi Jaiswal, Abhishek Sharma, Shubman Gill, Suryakumar Yadav – the captain, Hardik Pandya, Shreyas Iyer, Washington Sundar, Riyan Parag for the middle order, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Mohammed Siraj, Arshdeep Singh, KL Rahul, Jasprit Bumrah and Rishabh Pant.”'CRICKET NEVER STOPS FOR ANYONE'The Asia Cup will mark India’s first major multi-team tournament without stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. The duo featured in India’s previous two global triumphs — the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 and the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 — both won under Rohit’s leadership.This, as Harbhajan puts it, is the beginning of a new era.“See, cricket never stops for anyone. Whether we talk about the time of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, or Sachin Tendulkar, the game has always gone on. Someone or the other comes in and takes the team forward. Right now, the way Shubman Gill and his team-mates have played in England… Rohit and Virat have left their legacy in the right hands. We have seen the shift happen smoothly. It will be a big tournament that will be played without Virat and Rohit," Harbhajan said.PollShould Shubman Gill be included in the Asia Cup 2025 squad?Yes, he deserves a spotNo, we have better options"The way these youngsters have taken responsibility… I believe this is the natural rule of life — change is inevitable. If there is no change, things become stagnant. Moving forward is always good. And the way Shubman Gill and his team-mates have performed, it’s really pleasing to see."Of course, we have seen this shift earlier as well.

Jasprit Bumrah (Photo by Gareth Copley/Getty Images) Former BCCI chairman of selectors Chetan Sharma has supported Jasprit Bumrah's decision to play only three Tests in the five-match Anderson-Tendulkar series against England. The decision was made to manage Bumrah's workload, despite facing criticism.Bumrah, who has been prone to injuries, participated in the first, third, and fourth Tests while Mohammed Siraj led the pace attack in the remaining matches.Sharma, a former pace bowler himself, compared the situation to following a doctor's advice.Jasprit Bumrah press conference: Hits out at critics, on Lord's Honours Boards, ball controversyGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"If the medical team advises, if the doctor tells me that I have to take antibiotics, then I have to consume them," Sharma said in "The Great Indian Cricket Show" on Doordarshan. "If our physios are telling a player to manage workload, I think we should listen to them because they are the better judges."The comments were made at an event where Prasar Bharati, the country's public service broadcaster, signed a deal with London-based cricket analytics company.Sharma, who had a successful bowling partnership with Kapil Dev and claimed over 125 wickets in Tests and ODIs, expressed confidence in India's chances at the upcoming Asia Cup in the UAE."I know that whoever is selected will be the best for the country. And the kind of cricket we are playing right now, I'm really proud with the way India played in England," he added."And I'm very confident that we are definitely going to win the Asia Cup (to be played in T20 format) because soon after that we are playing the T20 World Cup (in 2026) in India."It's a very big thing when you are playing (the World Cup) in you own backyard. If the intent is right, the results will also be good."The event was attended by notable cricket personalities including Madan Lal from the 1983 World Cup-winning team, former India players Murali Kartik and Aakash Chopra, along with Prasar Bharati Chairman Navneet Kumar Sehgal.When asked about including Test captain Shubman Gill, who scored four centuries in the drawn England series, in the Asia Cup squad under Suryakumar Yadav's leadership, Sharma emphasised the need for selecting the best possible team. "Look, that is up to the selectors what they see. My opinion does not matter because I am no longer the chairman (of selectors), so I will only say that the best possible team should be selected," he stated."We have such good cricketers that not just the top-15 but even if the top-30 are selected, they are all very good. Really proud of them."Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

India are set to back Suryakumar Yadav as T20I captain for Asia Cup 2025, with Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer likely to miss out despite stellar form.

Samson, Abhishek Sharma, and Tilak Varma remain first-choice batters, while Jasprit Bumrah returns to lead the attack. Mohammed Siraj is expected to be rested, with Prasidh Krishna and Washington Sundar among likely inclusions. Indian cricket team Mumbai: The focus is likely to be on maintaining continuity and keeping faith in the young and successful T20 specialists when the Indian selectors meet here at the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) headquarters on Tuesday to pick the squad for the Asia Cup (to be played in the T20 format) in the UAE, scheduled from September 9-28.The meeting will be attended by India's T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav, who will fly in from Bengaluru after clearing his fitness test at the BCCI's Centre of Excellence (CoE), which means SKY stays on as India’s T20 captain, possibly till the 2026 T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.EXCLUSIVE: India to boycott Pakistan in Asia Cup? Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Contrary to expectations, star batter and India's Test captain Shubman Gill, who was tipped in some quarters to take over the vice-captaincy role in the T20 format after a highly successful tour of England, where he scored 754 runs in five Tests @75.40 with a top score of 269, is currently struggling to even make it to what is likely to be not more than a 15-man squad -- unless head coach Gautam Gambhir pushes for his inclusion in the T20 format too."Gill is a terrific batsman, all the selectors and head coach Gautam Gambhir are huge fans of his batting, and he is rated almost as highly as Virat Kohli in India’s cricket circles in terms of potential. However, he doesn’t fit into the T20 scheme of things right now. Presently, the idea is to persist with ‘keeper-bat Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma as openers, with Tilak Varma coming in at No. 3 and skipper Suryakumar at No. 4. If you see, Abhishek and Varma are rated as the No. 1 & No. 2 batters in T20Is in the ICC rankings currently. How can you keep them out?" a source close to the developments told TOI.Gill had a successful IPL 2025 too, where he slammed 650 runs in 15 matches @50.00, at a strike rate of 155.87, with six fifties, while captaining the Gujarat Titans. Along with young left-hander Sai Sudharsan, the 25-year-old forged an extremely prolific opening combination for GT.India captain Shubman Gill speaks during a press conference at Edgbaston, Birmingham, England, Tuesday July 1, 2025. AP/PTI(AP07_01_2025_000278A)However, Samson, Sharma, and Varma have done enough in T20Is last year to have the team management's confidence in them, at least for now. Samson smashed three hundreds in T20Is last year -- two against South Africa in an away series (107 & 109*) and one (111) against Bangladesh at Hyderabad in the home series. Tilak cracked back-to-back centuries (107 not out & 120 not out) against South Africa in November 2024. The 22-year-old had an average IPL this time for the Mumbai Indians, managing 343 runs in 16 matches @31.18 with two fifties, but that is unlikely to be held against him."Even Hardik Pandya had a bad IPL last year (while captaining MI), but he turned out to be one of India’s biggest heroes of their 2024 T20 World Cup triumph in the West Indies. Even greats like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have endured bad IPLs, but they were a different beast while playing for India in T20Is. You can’t judge a player just by one IPL," a source pointed out.Abhishek, of course, is a certainty after bludgeoning a scintillating 135 off just 54 balls, including 13 sixes and seven fours, against England at the Wankhede Stadium on February 2 this year. Incidentally, it was the last T20I India played before the Asia Cup.New Delhi: Sunrisers Hyderabad's Abhishek Sharma plays a shot during an Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 T20 cricket match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Sunrisers Hyderabad, at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, in New Delhi. (PTI Photo/Atul Yadav)  *** Local Caption ***"The current top four in India’s T20 cricket reflect their new-found resolve to play fearlessly in this format. In fact, if you are talking about taking a third opener in the Asia Cup squad, the case of Yashasvi Jaiswal is stronger than Gill's. Jaiswal has the tendency to hit a lot more boundaries in the Powerplay overs, which is mandatory in today’s T20 cricket. If you remember, Jaiswal was in India’s main squad in the T20 World Cup last year, while Gill was in the reserves," the source said.However, it’s learnt that Jaiswal, who scored two hundreds in the Test series in England (101 at Leeds & 118 at The Oval), has been asked to focus on red-ball cricket for now, considering India are scheduled to play four home Tests in the 2025-26 season—two each against West Indies and South Africa.PollWho do you think should be the vice-captain for India's T20 squad?Shubman GillSanju SamsonAbhishek SharmaShreyas IyerIyer too struggling to make the cutLike Gill, Shreyas Iyer is also struggling to make the cut, despite captaining Punjab Kings to the final of IPL 2025 and being in blazing form with the bat. The 30-year-old was India’s top run-getter in their Champions Trophy triumph in Dubai in March, scoring 243 runs in five matches @48.60, including two fifties. He scored 79 off 98 against New Zealand in the group stage, then 45 off 62 against Australia in the semifinal, and 48 off 62 in the final. However, he is competing with big-hitting left-handers, allrounder Shivam Dube and ‘finisher’ Rinku Singh.Bumrah set to be back, Siraj likely to be restedIn encouraging news for Team India, world No. 1 pacer Jasprit Bumrah, who played three Tests in England and was under the scanner for workload management, has conveyed his availability to the selectors for the Asia Cup, and will thus lead India’s attack."Bumrah had a minor knee injury, but will be fit for the Asia Cup. He is supposed to report to the BCCI’s CoE on August 30 for a fitness assessment," a source told TOI.London: India's Jasprit Bumrah and Prasidh Krishna during a training session ahead of the fifth Test cricket match between India and England, in London. (PTI Photo/R Senthilkumar)With the final of the Asia Cup set for September 28 in Dubai and the first Test against West Indies starting on October 2 in Ahmedabad, there’s a fair chance that Bumrah will miss at least the first Test of that series. Meanwhile, pacer Mohammed Siraj, who took nine for 190 in the fifth Test at The Oval and finished with 23 wickets in the England series, is likely to be rested from the Asia Cup. He will, however, be available for the home Tests.Apart from Bumrah, left-arm seamer Arshdeep Singh, Prasidh Krishna -- who won the Purple Cap in IPL 2025 with 25 wickets in 15 matches @19.52 for Gujarat Titans -- and Hardik Pandya will be the other seamers. Prasidh, though, could be competing for a spot with Delhi pacer Harshit Rana.Among spinners, Varun Chakravarthy and Kuldeep Yadav are certainties on the slow UAE wickets, while off-spinning allrounder Washington Sundar is almost guaranteed a spot.Kolkata: Kolkata Knight Riders' Varun Chakravarthy celebrates with teammates after taking the wicket of Chennai Super Kings' Dewald Brevis during an Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 T20 cricket match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Chennai Super Kings, at the Eden Gardens, in Kolkata, West Bengal. (PTI Photo/Swapan Mahapatra)The Asia Cup will begin with Afghanistan vs Hong Kong in Abu Dhabi on September 9. Clubbed in Group A with arch-rivals Pakistan, UAE and Oman, India will launch their campaign against UAE on September 10 in Dubai. They take on Pakistan on September 14 in the league stage, and most likely again in the Super Four stage on September 21. The final is scheduled for September 28.Jitesh Sharma, a star performer for IPL 2025 champions RCB (261 runs in 15 matches @37.28, SR 176.35, including a top score of 85*), is expected to be picked as the second wicketkeeper in the squad.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

It will take just 2-3 minutes.'"Everybody went out, but Sunil said, 'I am not coming.' He said, 'Let me concentrate. My batting is important for me and my team.' They left him alone.PollWhich aspect of Sunil Gavaskar's career do you find most impressive?His dedication to batting.His ability to remain unfazed under pressure.His consistency over the years."Sunil batted till tea, and scored some runs also. At the end of the day’s play, we didn’t know that the PM had come to the dressing room only to meet Gavaskar."This is how Sunil Gavaskar, in his prime, right from 1971 to 1987, was always a champion. He could get away with murder."The former Indian pacer recalled a few incidents to illustrate how Sunil Gavaskar often had his way, no matter the circumstances. One of the most infamous examples came during the 1975 World Cup, when Gavaskar played a painfully slow innings of 36 runs off 174 balls. The knock left his teammates in the dressing room frustrated, yet the Little Master remained unmoved and stuck to his approach."We, as Indian cricketers, did not know how to play one-day cricket. In the first match, England scored 334, but when we came to bat, Sunil played out all 60 overs in that particular match," Ghavri said."So many times, messages were sent, asking him to either accelerate or get out, trying to pick up the pace. But Sunil Gavaskar was Sunil Gavaskar in the 1970s."He wouldn't listen to anyone. He just played out Tony Greig, Geoff Arnold, Chris Old and Bob Willis. The reason he gave after the match was, 'I was facing these guys, practising against them for the Test matches in the future.'"There was turmoil in the dressing room. When our manager asked him, Gavaskar said, 'Leave me alone'," Ghavri added.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Earlier in the evening, Meerut Mavericks had posted a formidable 225/2. After a quick start from Akshay Dubey (44 off 26) and Rituraj Sharma (60 off 36), it was Madhav Kaushik who stole the show. Walking in at No. 4, Kaushik blazed his way to an unbeaten 95 off just 31 balls, striking 10 fours and seven sixes at a staggering strike rate of 306. His fireworks ensured Meerut set Kanpur a daunting 226-run target. In reply, the Superstars never found momentum. Reduced to 13/3 inside the powerplay, they were eventually restricted to 139/9.

Pathan also praises selector Ajit Agarkar's balanced approach and highlights the importance of coach-selector alignment in decision-making for fostering a merit-based environment. This shift aims to define a new era for Indian cricket. LONDON, ENGLAND - AUGUST 04: India coach Gautam Gambhir with Mohammed Siraj of India after the end of the match on day five of the 5th Rothesay Test Match at The Kia Oval on August 04, 2025 in London, England. (Photo by Gareth Copley/Getty Images) Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has thrown his weight behind head coach Gautam Gambhir, praising him for prioritising “team culture” over “star culture” in Indian cricket. Speaking candidly, Pathan highlighted how long-standing favoritism towards established names had often hurt promising players, and suggested that Gambhir, alongside chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar, is determined to bring lasting change in Indian cricket.“Mere liye team culture bahut important hai. (For me, team culture is very important). Gautam Gambhir jo hai na wahaan pe, jab tak wo apni coaching journey khatam karenge na, wo team culture le ke aayenge puri tarah se. (As long as Gambhir is the coach, he will fully instill team culture),” Pathan told Lallantop.Gautam Gambhir's fiery press conferences: Every time the India head coach lost his coolGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!The former left-arm pacer also spoke on how Indian cricket has, at times, been reluctant to move on from struggling players due to their past reputation. “Humare yahaan ek banda fail hue ja raha hai 3, 4, 5 saal se magar usko chance de do kyunki wo bahut bada player hai. Kahi toh aapko full stop lagana padega na. (Here, a player keeps failing for 3, 4, 5 years, but still gets opportunities because he is a big name. Somewhere, you have to put a full stop),” he explained.Pathan praised the current selection panel, led by Agarkar, for their balanced approach in picking teams. “Dusra jinka naam nahi aata, wo banda abada jabardast hai Indian cricket ke liye — chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar. (The other person who deserves credit is Ajit Agarkar, he is fantastic for Indian cricket),” Pathan said.PollDo you agree with Irfan Pathan's view that team culture is more important than star culture in cricket?Strongly AgreeAgreeDisagreeStrongly DisagreeHighlighting the decision-making process, Pathan stressed the importance of alignment between coach and selectors. “Aaj ek koi bhi decision hota hai na, wo sirf coach nahi le sakta, ek koi bhi decision selector nahi le sakta. Do log agar mil jaaye, jo majboot ho wo fir sahi direction mey jaate hai. Mujhe lagta hai ye dono sahi direction me ja rahe hai... team culture ko le kar. (Today, no decision can be taken solely by the coach or solely by the selector. If two strong individuals come together, the team moves in the right direction. I believe Gambhir and Agarkar are doing that with team culture),” he added.Pathan’s words reflect growing support for Gambhir’s philosophy of reducing individual favoritism and ensuring merit-based opportunities — a shift that could define the next era of Indian cricket.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Selectors have sidelined him from upcoming tournaments, prioritizing players who can maintain a faster run rate. Pakstan's Asia Cup campaign begins on September 12. Babar Azam and Mike Hesson (Images via Getty Images) Pakstan coach Mike Hesson has hinted that Babar Azam’s path back into the national T20I side could run through Australia’s Big Bash League later this year. The 30-year-old has been sidelined from the shortest format since late 2024, with selectors leaving him out of both the upcoming tri-series against UAE and Afghanistan and next month’s Asia Cup.'Perform in BBL': PAK coach Mike Hesson explains how Babar Azam can return to T20I squad after Asia Cup snub Hesson made it clear that while Babar remains a top-quality player, he needs to show progress in specific areas before reclaiming his spot. “There is no doubt Babar’s been asked to improve in some areas around taking on spin and in terms of his strike rate. Those are things he is working really hard on,” the coach said as quoted by the ICC.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Babar’s recent form has been inconsistent. He struck 47 in the first ODI against West Indies in Trinidad but followed it with scores of 0 and 9. His T20 record last year, of 738 runs in 24 matches at strike rates of 129.22 and 133.21, invited criticism for not being quick enough in a format where acceleration is crucial. Hesson suggested that Babar’s best chance to make a statement will come in December and January, when he is expected to feature in the BBL. “A player like Babar has an opportunity to play in the BBL and show he is improving in those areas in T20s. He is too good a player not to consider,” Hesson said. The coach also explained why others had been preferred in the current squad. “At the moment the players we have, have done exceptionally well. Sahibzada Farhan has played six games (against Bangladesh and West Indies) and won three Player of the Match awards,” he pointed out. Mohammad Rizwan’s exclusion was another notable call, with selectors opting to back batters who consistently score at a high strike rate.PollWhat do you believe is the main reason for Babar Azam's exclusion from the T20I side?Inconsistent performanceOther players performing better Hesson stressed the importance of rewarding recent form. “We need a run rate that puts us ahead of the game. T20 is all about setting the game up and being ahead of the game all the time,” he said.

Chappell's aggressive communication, emphasizing performance-based selection, created insecurity within the team. Pathan believes Chappell's intent was positive but his failure to adapt to Indian culture ultimately hindered his success, a crucial lesson in coaching. Irfan Pathan and Greg Chappell (Getty Images)  NEW DELHI: Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has opened up on Greg Chappell’s controversial stint as Team India’s head coach, offering a balanced view of the Australian’s methods. Pathan admitted that he personally benefited under Chappell, but also highlighted how the coach’s aggressive approach clashed with Indian cricketing culture, eventually contributing to a turbulent phase that included Sourav Ganguly’s removal as captain and India’s early exit from the 2007 ODI World Cup.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Pathan recalled how Chappell’s style created insecurity within the squad."He had his way of treating seniors and juniors with the same respect. But in that, he would be a bit more aggressive than one would like. He would tell anyone that if they don't perform, they will be dropped. I realised it was too aggressive, and once I talked to him privately about it," Pathan said on The Lallantop.IRFAN PATHAN FLYING FROM MUMBAI SPOTTED AT AIRPORT"I told him that we already know what you keep saying about being dropped. You don't need to tell us. It is causing insecurity in the team. He looked at me for a while, got a bit upset and threw some choicest of words, but then he realised I was right," he added.Pathan stressed that Chappell’s failure was not in intent but in cultural adaptation."If I go to Bangladesh or Sri Lanka or England as a coach, and if I don't accept their culture, would their players accept me? Greg Chappell's intention was right, but he wanted to bring an Australian culture. He wanted us to play hard cricket and didn't care what background anyone came from. But you can certainly do it in a much better way."Sharing his own county cricket experience, Pathan underlined why blending into a team’s environment is crucial."I played for Middlesex County club. You play a four-day match, then you drive the next day. They gather everyone in a bar before the match. I don't drink, but I need to accept their culture. You are a part of the team, and you need to blend in. If Chappell hadn't missed that one thing, he would've been one of the best coaches," he concluded.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Dewald Brevis and R Ashwin for CSK in the 2025 campaign (Images via Getty Images) Former Chennai Super Kings batter Anirudha Srikkanth has criticised R Ashwin for publicly discussing teammate Dewald Brevis’ contract on his YouTube channel, calling it an avoidable move from a current player. “This has come right after Ashwin, on his YouTube channel, spoke about his contract. Which I feel is, first of all, very, very wrong. Being a current player, being in the same team, talking about another player's contract - even though it might have been in a different context - this is the problem it can lead to,” Anirudha said on the Cheeky Cheeka YouTube channel.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! “You never talk about another person's contract, first of all. And because of that, CSK have strongly put out a statement. All the fans have been given that ease, stating: don’t worry at all, for the next two years this player is only for us,” he added. The row began when Ashwin suggested that CSK were willing to pay “extra” to sign Brevis in IPL 2025. The comments sparked speculation about the legality of the move, and led to the franchise releasing a clarification. Responding to the backlash, the former India spinner clarified that his remarks were never about finances. “My intent in the old video was to talk about Brevis’ batting, not about his IPL signing amount,” Ashwin explained. “We have to understand that every player who plays in the IPL has a contract with the franchise and the tournament. If there is anything wrong, it won’t be ratified. My point was about his batting, not money.”PollDo you think R Ashwin's comments about Dewald Brevis' contract were inappropriate?Yes, absolutelyNo, it was just a discussion He also underlined the importance of addressing such controversies quickly in the current media landscape. “In today’s time, there is a need to clarify the right things as well. No mistake has been made by the franchise, the player or the governing body,” Ashwin said. While Ashwin moved to set the record straight, Anirudha’s sharp criticism offers a reminder as to how sensitive matters like contract discussions are and that him speaking up about it while being a current teammate was far from ideal.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

This allows a shift in gears for the format. The focus is on identifying impactful players who can perform consistently under pressure, with IPL performances heavily influencing selection decisions. Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson (BCCI Photo) NEW DELHI: The Indian selectors are scheduled to choose the team for next month’s Asia Cup on Tuesday. Over the past twelve months, India’s T20 team had been largely forgotten as Test cricket remained in the spotlight and the ODI format became a priority briefly because of the ICC Champions Trophy. However, the focus is now firmly on T20 cricket ahead of the T20 World Cup to be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka in Feb and March. Ajit Agarkar’s selection committee faces a challenging task.EXCLUSIVE: India to boycott Pakistan in Asia Cup? Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!The process is similar to when they selected the team for the previous T20 World Cup in 2024. With the IPL expanding each year, India’s pool of players has seen huge growth. As debates continue over who should be included in India’s T20 squad travelling to the UAE in the first week of Sept, the IPL’s role in developing a strong pool of T20 players cannot be overlooked. In 2021, the BCCI made a notable statement by confidently fielding a white-ball team in Sri Lanka despite 18 cricketers being in England for a Test series. Currently, social media platforms often feature pages listing multiple playing XIs in T20s. Impact of scouts in leagues A review of the current pool of players reveals that prominent names were discovered by IPL teams. The emergence of Hardik Pandya, Jasprit Bumrah and Sanju Samson dates back to over a decade. Varun Chakravarthy is perhaps the top example of intensive scouting. Tilak Varma and Abhishek Sharma’s rapid rise highlights how IPL franchises supported them despite modest domestic performances. The scouting teams of IPL franchises reach areas where the BCCI’s regular selectors may find it difficult. Tanmay Shrivastava, who was part of Virat Kohli’s U-19 World Cup-winning team in 2008, is now retired and has served as a scout for Royal Challengers Bengaluru before becoming an umpire. “Network building is a huge part of the exercise. There are franchises who rely on match referees, umpires and curators for tip-offs. As scouts, we formed groups and spread out all over the country. We tried to cover every tournament,” Shrivastava told TOI. Each state association starting its own T20 league has added further depth. Priyansh Arya, Digvesh Rathi and Aniket Verma exemplify this. Selectors adopting the change in mindset Paras Mhambrey, who served BCCI as a bowling coach for developmental teams and the senior India team before rejoining Mumbai Indians last year, acknowledged that the selection process has evolved, attributing significant influence to the IPL. “Impact” is now the most crucial factor in evaluating a player, aligning with coach Gautam Gambhir’s perspective on the format. Former India opener Devang Gandhi, a member of the selection committee that first chose T Natarajan and Varun for India’s 2020-21 tour of Australia, warned against mixing formats. “Hardik and Bumrah were picked for the 2016 T20 World Cup by the selection committee before us. When we picked Natarajan and Varun, it was done purely looking at them as T20 specialists. We refer to IPL performances. A mystery spinner takes time to be picked by the opponents. Consistency in IPL gives enough idea about their temperament. Formats should not be mixed. With batters, you want to see them perform a little longer in various domestic tournaments,” Gandhi told TOI. A member of the previous selection committee, who wished to remain anonymous, agreed that Chakravarthy was selected based on his novelty. When Pandya’s bowling and fitness declined in 2021-22, the selectors opted for Venkatesh Iyer, who was discovered in the IPL in UAE. The selector noted that IPL has made maintaining a strong pool considerably easier. “For T20s, you don’t have to look too much into domestic records over a period of time. It’s about making impact consistently,” the selector said. The intense competition in India’s T20 scene has led selectors to focus more on rejection than selection. The omission of Shubman Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rinku Singh for the T20 World Cup that India won in 2024 sparked debate. They remain subjects of discussion as the next edition of the tournament gets closer. Former India wicketkeeper Vijay Dahiya, who has worked with KKR, DC and LSG, says, “When we picked Ayush Badoni and Mayank Yadav out of the blue for LSG in 2022, we looked at their potential to be international cricketers, but immediate IPL impact was at the forefront. Form in T20 cricket is often judged on recent performances. Over time, you get to see the hunger of a player. Chakravarthy is a prime example. He was discovered when he made his T20I debut. He went back and worked on his game to make a comeback. India has a sizeable database through IPL to separate modern-day T20 players. So, it’s still about selection,” Dahiya said. The IPL has provided a vast array of talent for selectors. The outcome will depend on how they form a balanced and impressive teamCatch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Virat Kohli (AFP Photo) NEW DELHI: Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has responded to criticism directed at him for his remarks on Virat Kohli’s batting, particularly surrounding the star batter’s retirement from Test cricket in May after a disappointing series in Australia in 2024-25. Kohli managed just 190 runs in nine innings during the series, despite scoring a century in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.Kohli announced his retirement from the longest format just before India’s squad selection for the England Tests, a decision that came amid a visible dip in his red-ball form. His struggles were evident in the pattern of dismissals, with the former captain frequently falling in the slips or to the wicketkeeper.Virat Kohli, Ravi Shastri & India’s Pace Revolution | Bharat Arun Reveals Untold Team India StoriesGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"If you look at my social media, there was Virat Kohli's slump in 2019-20. At that time, it was said that it was the time of COVID, and he wasn't getting inspiration. I thought that when a player of big stature undergoes their first slump, then they should be backed. If you look at my social media, I backed him a lot. One, he deserved it, and won a lot of matches. If the slump continues for five years, then it's not right," Pathan told Lallantop.PollDo you agree with Irfan Pathan's criticism of Virat Kohli's batting performance?Yes, he is rightNo, he is too harshPathan stressed that the team’s success must always remain the priority."Eventually, the team has to be at the top. Team is No. 1; we play for the team, we play to win games. If a batsman gets out in a similar manner, the opposition team plans accordingly. They won't go to plan B. They will get you out using plan A. If you're a champion player, then you've to take them from plan A to plan B. The problem with Virat in Test cricket was that he was getting out similarly every now and then. That doesn't mean he's a bad player; he's a champion player, but it's happening. You've to explain what you are seeing in detail," he saidThe former cricketer also elaborated on his role as a commentator, underlining that his accountability lies with the fans:"See, I believe that as a broadcaster, when the commentary is going on and the fans are watching the match, you have to go ahead of the visuals and speak about what's happening. The broadcaster and commentator's work is - what is happening and why it is happening. What can happen and how? If a player is doing exceptionally well, you praise him, and if they are not performing well, then criticize him. The commentators' responsibility is towards the fans, not players."Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

The selection decision remains complex due to India's packed top-order batting lineup and scheduling challenges, with multiple players vying for limited spots.   Gill has already established himself as a formidable force in ODIs, accumulating 2,775 runs and 22 fifty-plus scores in 55 matches. Reports suggest he could potentially return to the T20I team as vice-captain and might be in line for ODI leadership once current captain Rohit Sharma retires.   In his most recent T20 appearance during IPL 2025, Gill demonstrated his prowess by scoring 650 runs at a strike rate of nearly 156, including six fifties in 15 matches, finishing as the fourth-highest run-getter.   Gill's T20I career has shown steady improvement. He concluded 2024 with 266 runs in eight T20Is at an average of 38.00 and a strike rate of 133, including two fifties during the Zimbabwe series. His overall T20I statistics stand at 578 runs in 21 matches at an average of 30.42 and a strike rate exceeding 139.   The scheduling complexity poses a significant challenge for selectors. The Asia Cup final concludes on September 28, with home Tests against West Indies beginning October 2. This tight schedule requires careful consideration in team selection.   India's T20I performance has been remarkable since their T20 World Cup victory, winning 17 out of 20 bilateral series. During Gill's absence, several players have strengthened their positions in the team.   Abhishek Sharma has particularly impressed, scoring 279 runs against England with a strike rate of 220, including a spectacular 135 off 54 balls at Wankhede. Since the last T20 World Cup, he has amassed 1,363 runs in 42 matches at an average of 34.94 and a strike rate exceeding 198.   Tilak Varma has also shown consistent performance, scoring 1,200 runs in 36 matches at an average of 50.00 and a strike rate of 153.84 since the last T20 World Cup. He recorded two centuries during the South Africa tour.   Sanju Samson has reinvented himself as an opener alongside Abhishek, scoring 908 runs in 31 T20s at an average of 33.62 and a strike rate of 157.09 since the last T20 World Cup.   Captain Suryakumar Yadav has contributed 1,107 runs in T20s at an average of 36.90 and a strike rate of 161.13, though his international form has declined recently.   Gill's recent T20 statistics remain impressive, with 893 runs in 22 matches at an average of 47.00 and a strike rate over 147 since the last T20 World Cup.   Yashasvi Jaiswal, who like Gill last played T20I in July 2024, presents another strong candidacy with 723 runs in 23 T20Is, including a century and five fifties at a strike rate exceeding 164.   The current Samson-Abhishek opening combination makes it challenging to accommodate both Gill and Jaiswal in the playing XI. With a 15-member squad limit for the Asia Cup and World Cup, selecting all four players - Abhishek, Samson, Gill, and Jaiswal - appears unlikely, considering the need for backup players in other roles.   The final selection may come down to choosing between Jaiswal and Gill, with Samson holding an advantage as a wicketkeeper-batsman. The selectors will need to evaluate who can make a more significant impact in the upcoming tournaments. 18:32 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Will Shreyas Iyer feature in the squad?With Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, and Axar Patel already assured of their middle-order roles, India still has room for two — possibly even three or more batting spots to fill.At No. 3, the battle is shaping up between Tilak Varma, who currently holds the position, and Shreyas Iyer. Shreyas had a standout IPL 2025 with Punjab Kings, striking at 175.07 — the third-best in IPL history for a season with 600 or more runs, behind only Chris Gayle (2011) and Suryakumar (2023). His ability to take on spin adds further weight to his case.18:12 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Too many options? India selectors face a happy headacheIndian selectors are spoilt for choices ahead of a big T20 season, thanks to extensive IPL scouting, which has broadened the player pool. This allows a shift in gears for the format. The focus is on identifying impactful players who can perform consistently under pressure, with IPL performances heavily influencing selection decisions.READ FULL STORY17:30 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: EXCLUSIVE | Harbhajan Singh: 'Don't underestimate Shubman Gill, he can dominate T20Is too'With the Asia Cup 2025 squad set to be announced, Harbhajan Singh has backed Shubman Gill for inclusion despite stiff competition from India’s power-hitters.

Suryavanshi's impressive IPL 2025 performance and U19 tour of England have made him a strong contender. Srikkanth emphasizes Suryavanshi's maturity and shot-making ability, urging selectors to consider him for the upcoming T20 World Cup.READ FULL STORY16:47 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Sanju Samson under pressure?Sanju Samson has had a good run so far as an opener in T20s under Gautam Gambhir and Suryakumar Yadav, scoring three centuries at the top of the order. However, his last series against England was not very encouraging, as he managed only 51 runs and repeatedly fell to the short ball against Jofra Archer. If he starts as an opener again, he will be under some pressure.15:27 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Does Shubman Gill warrant a spot in India's T20 setup?Shubman Gill's Test success has sparked debate about his T20 inclusion and potential leadership role, despite his batting style not aligning with the team's aggressive approach. While his ODI place is secure, fitting him into the T20 side, which prioritizes high-strike-rate hitters like Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson, seems forced.READ FULL STORY15:01 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Harsha Bhogle names his picks for India squadHarsha Bhogle, on his YouTube channel, has named his picks for India’s T20I squad, with Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma, skipper Suryakumar Yadav, Shreyas Iyer and opener Sanju Samson featuring among the specialist batters. Samson is also Bhogle’s first-choice wicketkeeper, with Jitesh Sharma as backup. Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, and Washington Sundar form the all-round core, while Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh and Prasidh Krishna headline the pace attack.14:02 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Squad shaping upApart from Bumrah, the pace unit could feature Arshdeep Singh, Prasidh Krishna/Harshit Rana, and Hardik Pandya.

Jitesh Sharma is tipped to join as the backup wicketkeeper.13:50 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Bumrah Back, Siraj restedPacer Jasprit Bumrah has declared himself fit and will spearhead India’s attack in the UAE. Mohammed Siraj, however, is likely to be rested after a draining England Test series.13:43 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Iyer in TroubleDespite guiding Punjab Kings to the IPL final and being India’s top run-getter in the Champions Trophy, Shreyas Iyer faces stiff competition from power-hitters Shivam Dube and Rinku Singh.13:05 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Jaiswal’s case weakenedThough Yashasvi Jaiswal’s power-hitting makes him an attractive option, he’s reportedly been asked to focus on red-ball cricket, with four home Tests lined up in 2025-26.13:00 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Samson, Abhishek & Tilak the chosen trioThe likely top order: Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma to open, Tilak Varma at No.3, Suryakumar Yadav at No.4.

The T20I tournament, scheduled in the UAE from September 9-28, will see India compete in Group A alongside Pakistan, UAE, and Oman, with the event being viewed as a crucial testing ground for India's T20I core ahead of next year's T20 World Cup.The selection committee faces important decisions regarding the opening batting positions for the tournament. With Rohit Sharma's absence confirmed, the competition for opening slots has intensified between players like Shubman Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and Sanju Samson."There are a few talking points regarding the Asia Cup. The first question that comes to everyone's mind is whether Shubman Gill fits into the T20 plans because in the last World Cup, Yashasvi Jaiswal was the backup opener," Ashwin said on his YouTube channel. "So Jaiswal automatically gets a kick-in. Rohit Sharma is not going to be a part of that team, so Jaiswal automatically gets a look-in. Now, who is going to be that other opener?"The selection scenario is further complicated by the recent performances of multiple players vying for spots in the team. Gill's impressive recent Test series performance and Samson's success as a T20 opener have created additional considerations for the selectors."Shubman Gill had an outstanding series. Can he return to the squad? Sanju Samson has had a fabulous run as a T20 opener for India. So I think it is a tricky state for the selectors," Ashwin explained.The selection committee must also consider the potential return of Shreyas Iyer to the squad. "Can Shreyas Iyer make a comeback? There is a lot of decision-making that the selectors have to make," Ashwin remarked.08:53 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Pakistan squadSalman Ali Agha (captain), Abrar Ahmed, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Hasan Nawaz, Hussain Talat, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Haris (wicket-keeper), Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Waseem Jnr, Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, Salman Mirza, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Sufyan Moqim.08:45 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Gill vs Jaiswal – the final selection battle?Yashasvi Jaiswal, who last played a T20I in July 2024, has 723 runs in 23 matches at a strike rate of 164+, including a century. With only 15 squad spots available, selectors may have to choose between Gill and Jaiswal, with Samson holding an edge as a keeper-batter.08:44 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Samson-Abhishek partnership complicates mattersSanju Samson has reinvented himself as Abhishek’s opening partner, scoring 908 runs at a strike rate of 157 since the last T20 World Cup. With Samson also doubling as a wicketkeeper, his inclusion strengthens India’s balance, making it harder for both Gill and Jaiswal to fit in.08:44 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Abhishek Sharma emerging as front-runnerAbhishek Sharma’s explosive form is making him hard to ignore. Against England, he hammered 279 runs at a strike rate of 220, including a 135 off 54 balls at Wankhede.

His IPL 2025 form was also strong, with 650 runs at a strike rate of 156.08:42 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Gill under consideration despite packed scheduleShubman Gill, India’s newly-appointed Test captain, is being considered for the T20 Asia Cup starting September 9. However, selectors face a dilemma due to India’s crowded top-order and the tight scheduling, with Tests against West Indies beginning just four days after the Asia Cup final.08:41 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: WelcomeHello and welcome to our live coverage of the Asia Cup squad announcement. The Asia Cup will be played in the UAE from September 9-28, with India scheduled to open their campaign against the hosts on September 10, while the marquee fixture against arch-rivals Pakistan is slated on September 14, both in Dubai.We will be bringing you all the live updates. Stay tuned.India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Ahead of the Ajit Agarkar-led selection panel's meeting to pick India's Asia Cup squad, all eyes will be on Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal, whether the two explosive batters will find a place in India's Asia Cup squad. 

The Asia Cup will be played in the UAE from September 9-28, with India scheduled to open their campaign against the hosts on September 10, while the marquee fixture against arch-rivals Pakistan is slated on September 14, both in Dubai.

If all are fit and available, Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson (batter-keeper), Tilak Varma, skipper Surya Kumar Yadav and Hardik Pandya are automatic selections in top-five.

Now with Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal, two players with proven IPL records are back in the mix, the selectors will have to make some compromise with regards to one or two slots.

And this is pretty clear that at least in this Asia Cup, both Gill and Jaiswal wouldn't be in the same squad till Abhishek and Sanju are automatic choices.

Bhajji insisted Gill’s solid basics and adaptability make him a potential T20 dominator. Calling this a “new era” without Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, Harbhajan praised the youngsters for carrying forward Indian cricket’s legacy. India's player of the series India's captain Shubman Gill on day five of the fifth cricket test match between England and India at The Kia Oval in London, Monday, Aug. 4, 2025. (AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) NEW DELHI: The Asia Cup 2025 India squad is set to be announced, and the burning question is whether Test captain Shubman Gill will find a place in the team. With India’s T20I batting lineup already packed with hard-hitters like Abhishek Sharma, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson, Tilak Varma, captain Suryakumar Yadav, and Hardik Pandya, the selectors face a “sweet headache” when it comes to Gill’s inclusion.India’s top six T20I batters boast impressive strike rates: Abhishek Sharma (193.84), Suryakumar Yadav (167.07), Yashasvi Jaiswal (164.31), Hardik Pandya (141.67), Tilak Varma (155.07), and Sanju Samson (152.38).Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!In comparison, Gill has played 21 T20Is so far, with a strike rate of 139.27.So, will the selectors still back Shubman?Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh, who has closely observed Gill, strongly believes the youngster deserves a place in the squad.“In the T20 format, it’s important to understand that it’s not just about big hitting. If Shubman decides to attack, he can match anyone, because he is a very solid player with strong basics. A batter with such a strong foundation can score runs in any format," Harbhajan told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview."If you look at the IPL, Shubman has scored runs every season. He has worn the Orange Cap — and that doesn’t happen by chance. And it’s not like he bats only at a strike rate of 120 or 130; he can also bat at a strike rate of 160," he added."Yes, we do have players like Abhishek Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, and Tilak Varma, but you cannot undermine or underestimate Shubman Gill. He is a very talented batter who can adapt to any format. He is an all-format player. In my opinion, he can play T20s and even dominate the format. We as fans are used to seeing fours and sixes every ball, but you also need batters who can play long innings and rescue the team when required,” Harbhajan said.When asked to name his 15 for the Asia Cup, which is set to be picked on Tuesday, Harbhajan replied: "I think the squad should be: Yashasvi Jaiswal, Abhishek Sharma, Shubman Gill, Suryakumar Yadav – the captain, Hardik Pandya, Shreyas Iyer, Washington Sundar, Riyan Parag for the middle order, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Mohammed Siraj, Arshdeep Singh, KL Rahul, Jasprit Bumrah and Rishabh Pant.”'CRICKET NEVER STOPS FOR ANYONE'The Asia Cup will mark India’s first major multi-team tournament without stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. The duo featured in India’s previous two global triumphs — the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 and the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 — both won under Rohit’s leadership.This, as Harbhajan puts it, is the beginning of a new era.“See, cricket never stops for anyone. Whether we talk about the time of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, or Sachin Tendulkar, the game has always gone on. Someone or the other comes in and takes the team forward. Right now, the way Shubman Gill and his team-mates have played in England… Rohit and Virat have left their legacy in the right hands. We have seen the shift happen smoothly. It will be a big tournament that will be played without Virat and Rohit," Harbhajan said.PollShould Shubman Gill be included in the Asia Cup 2025 squad?Yes, he deserves a spotNo, we have better options"The way these youngsters have taken responsibility… I believe this is the natural rule of life — change is inevitable. If there is no change, things become stagnant. Moving forward is always good. And the way Shubman Gill and his team-mates have performed, it’s really pleasing to see."Of course, we have seen this shift earlier as well. When the big players move on, someone else steps up, takes responsibility, and carries the team forward. As long as the team keeps moving in the right direction, that is the main goal. The way Gill and his team have played in England, Rohit and Virat have definitely left their legacy in safe hands,” he added.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

'Don’t make Vaibhav Suryavanshi wait': Team India's Asia Cup squad selection debate receives fresh twist
Kris Srikkanth, former India captain, has surprisingly advocated for 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi's inclusion in the Asia Cup T20 squad. Suryavanshi's impressive IPL 2025 performance and U19 tour of England have made him a strong contender. Srikkanth emphasizes Suryavanshi's maturity and shot-making ability, urging selectors to consider him for the upcoming T20 World Cup.

RR's Vaibhav Suryavanshi celebrates his fifty (PTI Photo/Manvender Vashist Lav) Former India captain Kris Srikkanth has advocated for 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi's inclusion in India's 15-member squad for the upcoming Asia Cup T20, starting September 9. Srikkanth's endorsement comes as selectors prepare to finalize the squad on August 19, amid intense competition for spots, particularly in the opening positions.Vaibhav Suryavanshi has emerged as a strong contender following his performance in IPL 2025, where he scored 252 runs in seven matches for Rajasthan Royals at a strike rate exceeding 200. He also claimed the second-fastest century in IPL history, reaching the milestone in 35 deliveries against Gujarat Titans.Everything is special about Vaibhav Suryavanshi: Vikram RathourGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!The young prodigy continued his impressive form during the U19 tour of England, scoring a century and delivering strong performances in both one-day and four-day formats."You have to play bold. Don't make him wait. Don't say things like 'let him mature'. He is already playing with remarkable maturity. His shot-making has been on another level. If I were chairman, I would definitely have him in the squad," Srikkanth stated on his YouTube show.The selection discussion involves several established players, including Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson, who have secured their positions with an aggressive approach under coach Gautam Gambhir. Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill and current IPL Orange Cap holder Sai Sudharsan are also in contention.Srikkanth expressed uncertainty about Sanju Samson's inclusion in the squad and outlined his preferred opening combinations."Samson is doubtful, according to me," Srikkanth said. "My first-choice opener is Abhishek Sharma, no doubt. I will have two more openers. My picks would be Vaibhav Suryavanshi or Sai Sudharsan, with Shubman Gill as an option. If I were a selector, I would keep Vaibhav in the 15 for the T20 World Cup. He has been outstanding."PollShould Vaibhav Suryavanshi be included in India's squad for the Asia Cup T20?Yes, absolutely!No, he should wait."I think it should be Yashasvi Jaiswal, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, and Sai Sudharsan. I would take two out of these three. That would be my preference," he added.Since the T20 World Cup final in June 2024, Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson have been India's leading run-scorers in T20 internationals. Both players have received support from the team management, including head coach Gambhir and captain Suryakumar Yadav, for their aggressive batting style.Abhishek has accumulated 535 runs at an average of 33.43 with a strike rate of 193.84, including two centuries during this period. Samson has scored three hundreds in 17 matches at a strike rate of 171.47.However, Samson's recent performance in the five-match series against England has raised concerns. He struggled against short-pitched bowling and recorded three single-digit scores in five innings.Srikkanth, who previously captained a 16-year-old Sachin Tendulkar during his debut in Pakistan in 1989, believes India should not delay incorporating Vaibhav into the national setup as they prepare for next year's T20 World Cup.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

And the kind of cricket we are playing right now, I'm really proud with the way India played in England," he added."And I'm very confident that we are definitely going to win the Asia Cup (to be played in T20 format) because soon after that we are playing the T20 World Cup (in 2026) in India."It's a very big thing when you are playing (the World Cup) in you own backyard. If the intent is right, the results will also be good."The event was attended by notable cricket personalities including Madan Lal from the 1983 World Cup-winning team, former India players Murali Kartik and Aakash Chopra, along with Prasar Bharati Chairman Navneet Kumar Sehgal.When asked about including Test captain Shubman Gill, who scored four centuries in the drawn England series, in the Asia Cup squad under Suryakumar Yadav's leadership, Sharma emphasised the need for selecting the best possible team. "Look, that is up to the selectors what they see. My opinion does not matter because I am no longer the chairman (of selectors), so I will only say that the best possible team should be selected," he stated."We have such good cricketers that not just the top-15 but even if the top-30 are selected, they are all very good.

India are set to back Suryakumar Yadav as T20I captain for Asia Cup 2025, with Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer likely to miss out despite stellar form.

Mohammed Siraj is expected to be rested, with Prasidh Krishna and Washington Sundar among likely inclusions. Indian cricket team Mumbai: The focus is likely to be on maintaining continuity and keeping faith in the young and successful T20 specialists when the Indian selectors meet here at the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) headquarters on Tuesday to pick the squad for the Asia Cup (to be played in the T20 format) in the UAE, scheduled from September 9-28.The meeting will be attended by India's T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav, who will fly in from Bengaluru after clearing his fitness test at the BCCI's Centre of Excellence (CoE), which means SKY stays on as India’s T20 captain, possibly till the 2026 T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.EXCLUSIVE: India to boycott Pakistan in Asia Cup? Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Contrary to expectations, star batter and India's Test captain Shubman Gill, who was tipped in some quarters to take over the vice-captaincy role in the T20 format after a highly successful tour of England, where he scored 754 runs in five Tests @75.40 with a top score of 269, is currently struggling to even make it to what is likely to be not more than a 15-man squad -- unless head coach Gautam Gambhir pushes for his inclusion in the T20 format too."Gill is a terrific batsman, all the selectors and head coach Gautam Gambhir are huge fans of his batting, and he is rated almost as highly as Virat Kohli in India’s cricket circles in terms of potential. However, he doesn’t fit into the T20 scheme of things right now. Presently, the idea is to persist with ‘keeper-bat Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma as openers, with Tilak Varma coming in at No. 3 and skipper Suryakumar at No. 4. If you see, Abhishek and Varma are rated as the No. 1 & No. 2 batters in T20Is in the ICC rankings currently. How can you keep them out?" a source close to the developments told TOI.Gill had a successful IPL 2025 too, where he slammed 650 runs in 15 matches @50.00, at a strike rate of 155.87, with six fifties, while captaining the Gujarat Titans. Along with young left-hander Sai Sudharsan, the 25-year-old forged an extremely prolific opening combination for GT.India captain Shubman Gill speaks during a press conference at Edgbaston, Birmingham, England, Tuesday July 1, 2025. AP/PTI(AP07_01_2025_000278A)However, Samson, Sharma, and Varma have done enough in T20Is last year to have the team management's confidence in them, at least for now. Samson smashed three hundreds in T20Is last year -- two against South Africa in an away series (107 & 109*) and one (111) against Bangladesh at Hyderabad in the home series. Tilak cracked back-to-back centuries (107 not out & 120 not out) against South Africa in November 2024. The 22-year-old had an average IPL this time for the Mumbai Indians, managing 343 runs in 16 matches @31.18 with two fifties, but that is unlikely to be held against him."Even Hardik Pandya had a bad IPL last year (while captaining MI), but he turned out to be one of India’s biggest heroes of their 2024 T20 World Cup triumph in the West Indies. Even greats like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have endured bad IPLs, but they were a different beast while playing for India in T20Is. You can’t judge a player just by one IPL," a source pointed out.Abhishek, of course, is a certainty after bludgeoning a scintillating 135 off just 54 balls, including 13 sixes and seven fours, against England at the Wankhede Stadium on February 2 this year. Incidentally, it was the last T20I India played before the Asia Cup.New Delhi: Sunrisers Hyderabad's Abhishek Sharma plays a shot during an Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 T20 cricket match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Sunrisers Hyderabad, at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, in New Delhi. (PTI Photo/Atul Yadav)  *** Local Caption ***"The current top four in India’s T20 cricket reflect their new-found resolve to play fearlessly in this format. In fact, if you are talking about taking a third opener in the Asia Cup squad, the case of Yashasvi Jaiswal is stronger than Gill's. Jaiswal has the tendency to hit a lot more boundaries in the Powerplay overs, which is mandatory in today’s T20 cricket. If you remember, Jaiswal was in India’s main squad in the T20 World Cup last year, while Gill was in the reserves," the source said.However, it’s learnt that Jaiswal, who scored two hundreds in the Test series in England (101 at Leeds & 118 at The Oval), has been asked to focus on red-ball cricket for now, considering India are scheduled to play four home Tests in the 2025-26 season—two each against West Indies and South Africa.PollWho do you think should be the vice-captain for India's T20 squad?Shubman GillSanju SamsonAbhishek SharmaShreyas IyerIyer too struggling to make the cutLike Gill, Shreyas Iyer is also struggling to make the cut, despite captaining Punjab Kings to the final of IPL 2025 and being in blazing form with the bat. The 30-year-old was India’s top run-getter in their Champions Trophy triumph in Dubai in March, scoring 243 runs in five matches @48.60, including two fifties. He scored 79 off 98 against New Zealand in the group stage, then 45 off 62 against Australia in the semifinal, and 48 off 62 in the final. However, he is competing with big-hitting left-handers, allrounder Shivam Dube and ‘finisher’ Rinku Singh.Bumrah set to be back, Siraj likely to be restedIn encouraging news for Team India, world No. 1 pacer Jasprit Bumrah, who played three Tests in England and was under the scanner for workload management, has conveyed his availability to the selectors for the Asia Cup, and will thus lead India’s attack."Bumrah had a minor knee injury, but will be fit for the Asia Cup. He is supposed to report to the BCCI’s CoE on August 30 for a fitness assessment," a source told TOI.London: India's Jasprit Bumrah and Prasidh Krishna during a training session ahead of the fifth Test cricket match between India and England, in London. (PTI Photo/R Senthilkumar)With the final of the Asia Cup set for September 28 in Dubai and the first Test against West Indies starting on October 2 in Ahmedabad, there’s a fair chance that Bumrah will miss at least the first Test of that series. Meanwhile, pacer Mohammed Siraj, who took nine for 190 in the fifth Test at The Oval and finished with 23 wickets in the England series, is likely to be rested from the Asia Cup. He will, however, be available for the home Tests.Apart from Bumrah, left-arm seamer Arshdeep Singh, Prasidh Krishna -- who won the Purple Cap in IPL 2025 with 25 wickets in 15 matches @19.52 for Gujarat Titans -- and Hardik Pandya will be the other seamers. Prasidh, though, could be competing for a spot with Delhi pacer Harshit Rana.Among spinners, Varun Chakravarthy and Kuldeep Yadav are certainties on the slow UAE wickets, while off-spinning allrounder Washington Sundar is almost guaranteed a spot.Kolkata: Kolkata Knight Riders' Varun Chakravarthy celebrates with teammates after taking the wicket of Chennai Super Kings' Dewald Brevis during an Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 T20 cricket match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Chennai Super Kings, at the Eden Gardens, in Kolkata, West Bengal. (PTI Photo/Swapan Mahapatra)The Asia Cup will begin with Afghanistan vs Hong Kong in Abu Dhabi on September 9. Clubbed in Group A with arch-rivals Pakistan, UAE and Oman, India will launch their campaign against UAE on September 10 in Dubai. They take on Pakistan on September 14 in the league stage, and most likely again in the Super Four stage on September 21. The final is scheduled for September 28.Jitesh Sharma, a star performer for IPL 2025 champions RCB (261 runs in 15 matches @37.28, SR 176.35, including a top score of 85*), is expected to be picked as the second wicketkeeper in the squad.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

LONDON, ENGLAND - AUGUST 03: Media member and former Indian cpatain, Sunil Gavaskar speaks during day four of the Fifth Test Match between England and India at The Kia Oval on August 03, 2025 in London, England. (Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images) Former India cricketer Karsan Ghavri shared a few interesting facts about his ex-teammate Sunil Gavaskar and explained why the legendary India batter's aura will remain unmatched in Indian cricket.Ghavri said once the Indian team was playing a Test match against Australia at the then Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in Delhi. On the day of the game, former Prime Minister Morarji Desai was scheduled to meet players from both sides. However, Mr. Desai arrived 10 minutes late, and by then the toss had already taken place, with India set to bat first.Virat Kohli, Ravi Shastri & India’s Pace Revolution | Bharat Arun Reveals Untold Team India StoriesGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"Sunil Gavaskar was all set. Padded up. He was sitting in the dressing room and concentrating," Ghavri told Vickey Lalwani on his YouTube channel."Raj Singh Dungarpur was there, and in the meantime, he was concentrating. Sunil was about to go out and bat in a few minutes. Raj Singh said, 'Come on, everyone. The Prime Minister is here. The introduction will take place. It will take just 2-3 minutes.'"Everybody went out, but Sunil said, 'I am not coming.' He said, 'Let me concentrate. My batting is important for me and my team.' They left him alone.PollWhich aspect of Sunil Gavaskar's career do you find most impressive?His dedication to batting.His ability to remain unfazed under pressure.His consistency over the years."Sunil batted till tea, and scored some runs also. At the end of the day’s play, we didn’t know that the PM had come to the dressing room only to meet Gavaskar."This is how Sunil Gavaskar, in his prime, right from 1971 to 1987, was always a champion. He could get away with murder."The former Indian pacer recalled a few incidents to illustrate how Sunil Gavaskar often had his way, no matter the circumstances. One of the most infamous examples came during the 1975 World Cup, when Gavaskar played a painfully slow innings of 36 runs off 174 balls. The knock left his teammates in the dressing room frustrated, yet the Little Master remained unmoved and stuck to his approach."We, as Indian cricketers, did not know how to play one-day cricket. In the first match, England scored 334, but when we came to bat, Sunil played out all 60 overs in that particular match," Ghavri said."So many times, messages were sent, asking him to either accelerate or get out, trying to pick up the pace. But Sunil Gavaskar was Sunil Gavaskar in the 1970s."He wouldn't listen to anyone. He just played out Tony Greig, Geoff Arnold, Chris Old and Bob Willis. The reason he gave after the match was, 'I was facing these guys, practising against them for the Test matches in the future.'"There was turmoil in the dressing room. When our manager asked him, Gavaskar said, 'Leave me alone'," Ghavri added.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

His fireworks ensured Meerut set Kanpur a daunting 226-run target. In reply, the Superstars never found momentum. Reduced to 13/3 inside the powerplay, they were eventually restricted to 139/9.

Lawyers for the 40-year-old former Chelsea, Arsenal and Real Madrid midfielder cited "unsuccessful settlement negotiations with FIFA" for the financial claim for damages throughout his career. "Lassana Diarra is claiming 65 million gross (35 million net) in compensation from FIFA and the Belgian Football Association," his legal firm Dupont Hissel said in a statement. FIFA was approached for comment about the latest high-stakes legal challenge to its authority.  Diarra's case, which is back in court in Belgium, is supported by the global players' union FIFPRO, its European division and their national member union in France. The legal case started in the home country of Charleroi, the Belgian club that wanted to sign Diarra after his contract in Moscow was terminated. FIFA transfer rules at the time made the player and the potential signing club liable for paying the former club when a contract was ruled to have been broken without "just cause." The Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld FIFA's ruling in favor of Lokomotiv. The case was sent to the European court which said the FIFA rules "hinder the free movement of players and competition between clubs." Diarra's dispute with Lokomotiv and FIFA forced him to miss the 2014-15 season. He then signed for Marseille and ended his career at Paris Saint-Germain six years ago. "I am doing this for myself," Diarra said in a statement Monday published by his lawyers. "And if I have been able to hold out against the FIFA steamroller, it is because I had a good career." "But I have also done it for all the up and coming, lesser known players who do not have the financial and psychological means to challenge FIFA before real judges," he said. Diarra's lawyers also are working on a class action suit filed this month against FIFA and some national soccer federations in Europe which claims could benefit 100,000 players over more than two decades.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Heinrich Klaasen and Ishan Kishan (Images via Getty Images & Instagram/@ishankishan23) Heinrich Klaasen gave fans a peek into the lighter side of the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) team, sharing some amusing dressing-room secrets during a candid interaction with the franchise. The South African wicketkeeper-batter didn’t hold back while poking fun at his teammates, with Ishan Kishan emerging as the central figure of his playful comments. Kishan, who joined SRH in the IPL 2025 auction for ₹11.25 crore after being released by Mumbai Indians, was singled out for always being in front of the mirror. When asked who in the squad was the mirror magnet, Klaasen responded with a laugh: “Doing a couple of shoots with him, I would say Ishan (Kishan).”Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

He went on to explain that the left-handed batter is extremely particular about his appearance. “Ishan really needs to get his hair perfectly to be happy,” Klaasen remarked, adding that Kishan’s obsession with grooming stands out in the squad. However, Klaasen didn’t let Kishan take the entire spotlight, pointing out that Australian leg-spinner Adam Zampa is also right up there when it comes to hairstyles. Referring to Zampa’s exciting hairstyles over the years, he joked that the spinner probably is the "haircut enthusiast".PollWho has the best hairstyle in the SRH team?Ishan KishanAdam Zampa Kishan was again at the center of attention when Klaasen was asked about the best actor in the SRH squad. Without hesitation, he named the 27-year-old. “We did a shoot and he was unbelievable,” Klaasen recalled, praising Kishan’s ability to perform in front of the camera. The banter didn’t stop there. Klaasen also aimed a cheeky dig at his captain, Pat Cummins. “His acting is just OK. But there are low budget movies, so we give it to him,” he quipped, leaving fans with a glimpse of the light-hearted atmosphere within the SRH unit.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Inspired by Moeen Ali, Bashir used the carrom ball, the same delivery he used to dismiss Siraj in the second Test at Edgbaston, to achieve the decisive breakthrough. Despite a finger injury, Bashir contributed with the bat, adding crucial runs. Getty Images NEW DELHI: Off-spinner Shoaib Bashir says the joy of dismissing India’s Mohammed Siraj to seal the Lord’s Test win for England will stay with him "forever." The 21-year-old also credited former teammate Moeen Ali for inspiring him to use the carrom ball, the delivery that ultimately brought him success. Bashir, who fractured his little finger at Lord’s and was ruled out of the remainder of the five-Test series, had already dismissed Siraj with the carrom ball in the second Test at Edgbaston.With Ravindra Jadeja (61 not out) threatening to take India home at Lord’s, captain Ben Stokes turned to Bashir for the breakthrough. Despite bowling with his left hand heavily strapped, the youngster delivered, removing Siraj with a ball that bounced and spun sharply.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"I met Moeen Ali for the first time at Edgbaston and we spoke a lot," Bashir told The Sunday Times. "Mo encouraged me to bowl the carrom ball. He's someone I've always looked up to and for him to say, 'Back yourself to do it,' meant a lot."Bashir revealed he had been working on the variation for a while but only gained confidence to use it after Moeen joined England’s training camp."I just wanted to show that I’ve got that strength in me. I bowled it a few times and it came out nicely. I got Siraj out with it (stumped in the first innings), with a really slow ball -- it was only about 43 to 44mph."Since Edgbaston, I’ve been in touch with Mo a fair few times. He's a legend and someone I look up to massively, especially being an off spinner in England, which is not an easy job," he added.Chasing 193, India slipped to 112/8 before Jadeja steadied them with partnerships alongside Jasprit Bumrah (5 off 54) and Siraj. Siraj resisted 29 balls before Bashir produced the decisive strike. The delivery spun back after being played onto the pitch and crashed into the base of Siraj’s leg stump, sparking wild England celebrations."We were creating chances, but just couldn’t get that wicket. I really wanted to get out there. Stokesy knew and gave me the go-ahead when he was on the field and I was on the bench. My left hand felt pretty good when I was bowling. I’m just glad I could make a difference."We got Joe Root to come into silly point to put pressure on Siraj, and I just tried to put as many revs on that ball as I could. Luckily it popped from a length and when it hit his bat (and down into the ground), everyone was just looking, ‘Where is it?’”Bashir said the moment is etched in his memory."From my angle I couldn’t really see (the bail coming off). My reaction was off a lot of other peoples’ reaction. I was just relieved. That feeling will stay with me forever -- at the home of cricket in front of a packed crowd. It doesn’t get better."Inside Lord's: Exclusive Stadium Tour & Must-Do ExperiencesThe spinner had injured his non-bowling hand earlier while trying to take a return catch off Jadeja in India’s first innings. He later underwent surgery, with two pins inserted in his finger, and remains under medical observation five weeks on.Despite the pain, he still contributed with the bat, scoring two off nine balls in a gritty seven-run stand with Jofra Archer that helped England stretch their lead in a match they eventually won by 22 runs."It (the injury) happened, I came off the field and went for a scan,” he recalled. “I knew it was pretty bad at that point, but I had plenty of pain-killers. There was no real conversation about me batting."My first ball from (Jasprit) Bumrah was a bouncer and the next ball a yorker, and it was one of those where the vibrations went right up through your hands. But I was always going to bat, even if it was only to add five-to-ten runs. In the grand scheme of things, they might matter."Bashir missed the rest of the series as India fought back to level it 2-2. His replacement, Liam Dawson, went wicketless across 47 overs at Old Trafford as India batted out a draw at 427/6 declared."It looked like the wicket flattened out and not much was happening. Even the Indian spinners struggled," said Bashir, who finished the series with 10 wickets at 54.1.Among Indian spinners, Jadeja picked up seven wickets at 72.4 while Washington Sundar claimed seven at 38.6."It was an incredible series to be part of. I learnt a lot playing against some of the best players in the world. I was quite happy with my performances," Bashir added.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Pathan also praises selector Ajit Agarkar's balanced approach and highlights the importance of coach-selector alignment in decision-making for fostering a merit-based environment. This shift aims to define a new era for Indian cricket. LONDON, ENGLAND - AUGUST 04: India coach Gautam Gambhir with Mohammed Siraj of India after the end of the match on day five of the 5th Rothesay Test Match at The Kia Oval on August 04, 2025 in London, England. (Photo by Gareth Copley/Getty Images) Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has thrown his weight behind head coach Gautam Gambhir, praising him for prioritising “team culture” over “star culture” in Indian cricket. Speaking candidly, Pathan highlighted how long-standing favoritism towards established names had often hurt promising players, and suggested that Gambhir, alongside chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar, is determined to bring lasting change in Indian cricket.“Mere liye team culture bahut important hai. (For me, team culture is very important). Gautam Gambhir jo hai na wahaan pe, jab tak wo apni coaching journey khatam karenge na, wo team culture le ke aayenge puri tarah se. (As long as Gambhir is the coach, he will fully instill team culture),” Pathan told Lallantop.Gautam Gambhir's fiery press conferences: Every time the India head coach lost his coolGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!The former left-arm pacer also spoke on how Indian cricket has, at times, been reluctant to move on from struggling players due to their past reputation. “Humare yahaan ek banda fail hue ja raha hai 3, 4, 5 saal se magar usko chance de do kyunki wo bahut bada player hai. Kahi toh aapko full stop lagana padega na. (Here, a player keeps failing for 3, 4, 5 years, but still gets opportunities because he is a big name. Somewhere, you have to put a full stop),” he explained.Pathan praised the current selection panel, led by Agarkar, for their balanced approach in picking teams. “Dusra jinka naam nahi aata, wo banda abada jabardast hai Indian cricket ke liye — chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar. (The other person who deserves credit is Ajit Agarkar, he is fantastic for Indian cricket),” Pathan said.PollDo you agree with Irfan Pathan's view that team culture is more important than star culture in cricket?Strongly AgreeAgreeDisagreeStrongly DisagreeHighlighting the decision-making process, Pathan stressed the importance of alignment between coach and selectors. “Aaj ek koi bhi decision hota hai na, wo sirf coach nahi le sakta, ek koi bhi decision selector nahi le sakta. Do log agar mil jaaye, jo majboot ho wo fir sahi direction mey jaate hai. Mujhe lagta hai ye dono sahi direction me ja rahe hai... team culture ko le kar. (Today, no decision can be taken solely by the coach or solely by the selector. If two strong individuals come together, the team moves in the right direction. I believe Gambhir and Agarkar are doing that with team culture),” he added.Pathan’s words reflect growing support for Gambhir’s philosophy of reducing individual favoritism and ensuring merit-based opportunities — a shift that could define the next era of Indian cricket.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Selectors have sidelined him from upcoming tournaments, prioritizing players who can maintain a faster run rate. Pakstan's Asia Cup campaign begins on September 12. Babar Azam and Mike Hesson (Images via Getty Images) Pakstan coach Mike Hesson has hinted that Babar Azam’s path back into the national T20I side could run through Australia’s Big Bash League later this year. The 30-year-old has been sidelined from the shortest format since late 2024, with selectors leaving him out of both the upcoming tri-series against UAE and Afghanistan and next month’s Asia Cup.'Perform in BBL': PAK coach Mike Hesson explains how Babar Azam can return to T20I squad after Asia Cup snub Hesson made it clear that while Babar remains a top-quality player, he needs to show progress in specific areas before reclaiming his spot. “There is no doubt Babar’s been asked to improve in some areas around taking on spin and in terms of his strike rate. Those are things he is working really hard on,” the coach said as quoted by the ICC.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Babar’s recent form has been inconsistent. He struck 47 in the first ODI against West Indies in Trinidad but followed it with scores of 0 and 9. His T20 record last year, of 738 runs in 24 matches at strike rates of 129.22 and 133.21, invited criticism for not being quick enough in a format where acceleration is crucial. Hesson suggested that Babar’s best chance to make a statement will come in December and January, when he is expected to feature in the BBL. “A player like Babar has an opportunity to play in the BBL and show he is improving in those areas in T20s. He is too good a player not to consider,” Hesson said. The coach also explained why others had been preferred in the current squad. “At the moment the players we have, have done exceptionally well. Sahibzada Farhan has played six games (against Bangladesh and West Indies) and won three Player of the Match awards,” he pointed out. Mohammad Rizwan’s exclusion was another notable call, with selectors opting to back batters who consistently score at a high strike rate.PollWhat do you believe is the main reason for Babar Azam's exclusion from the T20I side?Inconsistent performanceOther players performing better Hesson stressed the importance of rewarding recent form. “We need a run rate that puts us ahead of the game.

Pathan believes Chappell's intent was positive but his failure to adapt to Indian culture ultimately hindered his success, a crucial lesson in coaching. Irfan Pathan and Greg Chappell (Getty Images)  NEW DELHI: Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has opened up on Greg Chappell’s controversial stint as Team India’s head coach, offering a balanced view of the Australian’s methods. Pathan admitted that he personally benefited under Chappell, but also highlighted how the coach’s aggressive approach clashed with Indian cricketing culture, eventually contributing to a turbulent phase that included Sourav Ganguly’s removal as captain and India’s early exit from the 2007 ODI World Cup.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Pathan recalled how Chappell’s style created insecurity within the squad."He had his way of treating seniors and juniors with the same respect. But in that, he would be a bit more aggressive than one would like. He would tell anyone that if they don't perform, they will be dropped. I realised it was too aggressive, and once I talked to him privately about it," Pathan said on The Lallantop.IRFAN PATHAN FLYING FROM MUMBAI SPOTTED AT AIRPORT"I told him that we already know what you keep saying about being dropped. You don't need to tell us. It is causing insecurity in the team. He looked at me for a while, got a bit upset and threw some choicest of words, but then he realised I was right," he added.Pathan stressed that Chappell’s failure was not in intent but in cultural adaptation."If I go to Bangladesh or Sri Lanka or England as a coach, and if I don't accept their culture, would their players accept me? Greg Chappell's intention was right, but he wanted to bring an Australian culture. He wanted us to play hard cricket and didn't care what background anyone came from. But you can certainly do it in a much better way."Sharing his own county cricket experience, Pathan underlined why blending into a team’s environment is crucial."I played for Middlesex County club. You play a four-day match, then you drive the next day. They gather everyone in a bar before the match. I don't drink, but I need to accept their culture. You are a part of the team, and you need to blend in. If Chappell hadn't missed that one thing, he would've been one of the best coaches," he concluded.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Two players of Trent Rockets suffered brutal injuries in recent games in The Hundred (Images via X/Screengrab & Getty Images) Trent Rockets endured a painful weekend in The Hundred, with two players suffering serious injuries in the space of just two days. The most alarming came on Saturday at Trent Bridge, where Adam Hose dislocated his ankle during the clash against Southern Brave. The incident occurred late in the first innings when the batter was fielding. Hose attempted to stop a firm shot from Michael Bracewell but lost his footing and twisted his ankle awkwardly. The live images showed him in serious pain as medical staff rushed in. A screen was quickly put up around him before he was carried off and taken to hospital.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Reports later confirmed that Hose had suffered a dislocated ankle, an injury that could take several weeks to recover from. On Sunday, the batter shared an update on Instagram, posting a picture of his heavily bandaged foot. Adam Hose on Instagram (Screengrab) The Hundred and his county side Worcestershire CCC also sent their support. Several supporters also shared messages of support and wished the player a speedy recovery.  Despite Hose’s absence, the Rockets finished the game strongly. Tom Banton struck 49 from 38 balls, while Tom Moores powered a 30-ball 55 to guide them to victory.Days earlier, the team had also seen Tom Alsop suffer a nasty injury against London Spirit. Facing Jamie Overton, Alsop was beaten for pace as the ball snuck through the helmet grill and struck him just above the nose.

This allows a shift in gears for the format. The focus is on identifying impactful players who can perform consistently under pressure, with IPL performances heavily influencing selection decisions. Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson (BCCI Photo) NEW DELHI: The Indian selectors are scheduled to choose the team for next month’s Asia Cup on Tuesday. Over the past twelve months, India’s T20 team had been largely forgotten as Test cricket remained in the spotlight and the ODI format became a priority briefly because of the ICC Champions Trophy. However, the focus is now firmly on T20 cricket ahead of the T20 World Cup to be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka in Feb and March. Ajit Agarkar’s selection committee faces a challenging task.EXCLUSIVE: India to boycott Pakistan in Asia Cup? Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!The process is similar to when they selected the team for the previous T20 World Cup in 2024. With the IPL expanding each year, India’s pool of players has seen huge growth. As debates continue over who should be included in India’s T20 squad travelling to the UAE in the first week of Sept, the IPL’s role in developing a strong pool of T20 players cannot be overlooked. In 2021, the BCCI made a notable statement by confidently fielding a white-ball team in Sri Lanka despite 18 cricketers being in England for a Test series. Currently, social media platforms often feature pages listing multiple playing XIs in T20s. Impact of scouts in leagues A review of the current pool of players reveals that prominent names were discovered by IPL teams. The emergence of Hardik Pandya, Jasprit Bumrah and Sanju Samson dates back to over a decade. Varun Chakravarthy is perhaps the top example of intensive scouting. Tilak Varma and Abhishek Sharma’s rapid rise highlights how IPL franchises supported them despite modest domestic performances. The scouting teams of IPL franchises reach areas where the BCCI’s regular selectors may find it difficult. Tanmay Shrivastava, who was part of Virat Kohli’s U-19 World Cup-winning team in 2008, is now retired and has served as a scout for Royal Challengers Bengaluru before becoming an umpire. “Network building is a huge part of the exercise. There are franchises who rely on match referees, umpires and curators for tip-offs. As scouts, we formed groups and spread out all over the country. We tried to cover every tournament,” Shrivastava told TOI. Each state association starting its own T20 league has added further depth. Priyansh Arya, Digvesh Rathi and Aniket Verma exemplify this. Selectors adopting the change in mindset Paras Mhambrey, who served BCCI as a bowling coach for developmental teams and the senior India team before rejoining Mumbai Indians last year, acknowledged that the selection process has evolved, attributing significant influence to the IPL. “Impact” is now the most crucial factor in evaluating a player, aligning with coach Gautam Gambhir’s perspective on the format. Former India opener Devang Gandhi, a member of the selection committee that first chose T Natarajan and Varun for India’s 2020-21 tour of Australia, warned against mixing formats. “Hardik and Bumrah were picked for the 2016 T20 World Cup by the selection committee before us. When we picked Natarajan and Varun, it was done purely looking at them as T20 specialists. We refer to IPL performances. A mystery spinner takes time to be picked by the opponents. Consistency in IPL gives enough idea about their temperament. Formats should not be mixed. With batters, you want to see them perform a little longer in various domestic tournaments,” Gandhi told TOI. A member of the previous selection committee, who wished to remain anonymous, agreed that Chakravarthy was selected based on his novelty. When Pandya’s bowling and fitness declined in 2021-22, the selectors opted for Venkatesh Iyer, who was discovered in the IPL in UAE. The selector noted that IPL has made maintaining a strong pool considerably easier. “For T20s, you don’t have to look too much into domestic records over a period of time. It’s about making impact consistently,” the selector said. The intense competition in India’s T20 scene has led selectors to focus more on rejection than selection. The omission of Shubman Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rinku Singh for the T20 World Cup that India won in 2024 sparked debate. They remain subjects of discussion as the next edition of the tournament gets closer. Former India wicketkeeper Vijay Dahiya, who has worked with KKR, DC and LSG, says, “When we picked Ayush Badoni and Mayank Yadav out of the blue for LSG in 2022, we looked at their potential to be international cricketers, but immediate IPL impact was at the forefront. Form in T20 cricket is often judged on recent performances. Over time, you get to see the hunger of a player. Chakravarthy is a prime example. He was discovered when he made his T20I debut. He went back and worked on his game to make a comeback. India has a sizeable database through IPL to separate modern-day T20 players. So, it’s still about selection,” Dahiya said. The IPL has provided a vast array of talent for selectors. The outcome will depend on how they form a balanced and impressive teamCatch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Beyond survival and adaptation, the crew discovered an unexpected benefit in PS4 gaming. Video games helped maintain cognitive sharpness, reduce stress, and improve problem-solving skills.  In 2023, NASA conducted a groundbreaking experiment to simulate life on Mars, confining four volunteers in a habitat replica for over a year. The mission, known as CHAPEA (Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog), aimed to study how humans cope with extreme isolation, limited resources, and communication delays. While the scientific focus was on survival, adaptation, and psychological resilience, the crew discovered an unexpected ally: PS4 gaming. Beyond entertainment, video games helped the volunteers maintain cognitive sharpness, reduce stress, and improve problem-solving skills, offering insights for the future of long-duration space missions.How NASA simulates life on MarsThe CHAPEA mission recreated the harsh and confined conditions astronauts would face on a Mars journey. Volunteers lived in a 160-square-meter habitat at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston for 378 days. The experiment tested not only physical endurance, like managing food supplies and simulated spacewalks, but also the emotional and mental resilience of a crew cut off from the outside world. With Mars missions expected to last up to two years, understanding isolation’s impact on teamwork, decision-making, and morale is critical for preparing astronauts for interplanetary travel.Video games as a mental health tool During the mission, PS4 gaming became a central way for the crew to cope with monotony and stress. Strategy and simulation games like SimCity, Civilization, and Factorio challenged the participants to plan, manage resources, and solve complex problems, skills directly relevant to space travel. Microbiologist Anca Selariu noted that gaming sessions offered cognitive training while providing a mental escape, keeping the crew’s minds active and morale high. NASA researchers now see gaming as a potential standard tool for future long-duration missions.Coping with isolation and psychological challenges The volunteers experienced strict isolation, with communication to NASA delayed by 22 minutes each way. Living without natural light in a small habitat tested their mental endurance. Video games played a vital role in maintaining mental health, helping reduce feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and stress. They also encouraged teamwork, strategic thinking, and problem-solving under pressure, essential skills for astronauts on real interplanetary missions. The CHAPEA mission demonstrates that structured entertainment can complement physical and psychological training for future explorers.Lessons for future Mars missions NASA’s Mars simulation experiment highlights the importance of addressing psychological needs during long-duration spaceflight. Incorporating video games and other interactive entertainment may improve astronauts’ cognitive function, morale, and overall mission success. By combining rigorous scientific research with practical coping strategies, missions like CHAPEA pave the way for safer, more effective human exploration of Mars and beyond.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

The New Glenn rocket will launch NASA's ESCAPADE probes in September 2025. This marks Blue Origin's first interplanetary flight. The mission will study Mars' magnetosphere and atmosphere. It will provide data on solar wind interaction. The launch highlights commercial space exploration.  Blue Origin, led by Jeff Bezos, is gearing up for a landmark mission to Mars, set to launch NASA’s ESCAPADE probes aboard the New Glenn rocket on September 29, 2025. This will mark Blue Origin’s first interplanetary flight and is notable because it precedes any Mars-bound mission from Elon Musk’s SpaceX, whose Starship is still undergoing development and orbital tests. The ESCAPADE mission, valued at $80 million, aims to study Mars’ magnetosphere and atmosphere, providing critical data on how solar wind interacts with the Red Planet. The launch represents a significant milestone in commercial space exploration and highlights the growing collaboration between private companies and government space agencies.ESCAPADE mission: Blue Origin and NASA’s groundbreaking Mars explorationBlue Origin, led by Jeff Bezos, will carry NASA’s twin ESCAPADE probes to Mars aboard the New Glenn rocket. The probes are designed to study Mars’ magnetosphere and space weather, analyzing how solar wind interacts with the Martian atmosphere and affects the planet’s climate and radiation environment. Managed by the University of California’s Space Sciences Laboratory, this mission will provide vital data for scientists studying Mars’ unique atmospheric and magnetic characteristics. Beyond its scientific goals, the mission represents a major collaboration between NASA and the commercial space sector, showing how private companies like Blue Origin can contribute to deep-space exploration while supporting critical planetary research initiatives.Blue Origin New Glenn’s role in interplanetary spaceflightThe upcoming launch is a milestone for Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket, which stands 188.5 feet tall and is designed for heavy-lift commercial and interplanetary missions. This mission will be the first time New Glenn is tasked with delivering payloads beyond Earth orbit, demonstrating the rocket’s precision, reliability, and long-range capabilities. Successfully transporting the ESCAPADE probes will solidify New Glenn’s role as a key player in commercial interplanetary travel and will provide valuable insights into the performance of large rockets under the unique stresses of a Mars-bound mission. This step will further position Blue Origin in the competitive landscape of space exploration.Reusable rocket technologyBlue Origin plans to recover New Glenn’s first stage booster, which measures 57.5 meters, using a drone ship stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. The recovery is a crucial step in Blue Origin’s mission to create fully reusable rockets, aiming to lower launch costs and reduce the environmental footprint of space missions. While the first test flight in early 2025 successfully delivered payloads to Earth orbit, the booster landing attempt was unsuccessful. This upcoming flight offers another chance to perfect booster recovery, a key technology for sustainable and cost-effective interplanetary missions. Mastering reusability is central to Blue Origin’s long-term vision for commercial spaceflight.Secondary payload: Advancing space communicationsIn addition to the ESCAPADE probes, New Glenn will carry a secondary payload from satellite communications company Viasat. This demonstration supports NASA’s Communications Services Project, aimed at improving satellite communication networks for both near-Earth and interplanetary operations. The payload will test advanced communication technologies that could enhance data transmission between spacecraft and Earth, supporting future missions to Mars, the Moon, and beyond. By integrating secondary payloads, Blue Origin can provide additional value to NASA and commercial partners, while advancing technologies that are essential for the next generation of space exploration.Blue Origin and SpaceX in the Mars raceWhile Blue Origin’s New Glenn will launch NASA’s Mars probes before SpaceX sends any payload to the Red Planet, Elon Musk’s Starship continues to undergo testing and development for future Mars missions. This launch highlights the growing importance of commercial companies in planetary exploration and the role private firms play in advancing space technology. Both Blue Origin and SpaceX are pushing the boundaries of rocket design, reusability, and interplanetary capability, creating a new era of collaboration and competition in the quest to explore Mars and other distant worlds.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

He was greeted by ministers, ISRO chairman, and space enthusiasts. Shukla is scheduled to meet PM Modi and participate in National Space Day celebrations, with Parliament set to discuss his mission and India's space program. Astronaut Subhanshu Shukla, along with astronaut Prashant Balakrishnan Nair, receives grand welcome from Union space minister Jitendra Singh, Delhi CM Rekha Gupta and and Isro chairman V Narayanan at the Delhi airport NEW DELHI: Following his historic mission to the International Space Station (ISS), Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla received a red-carpet welcome at Delhi’s IGI airport as he returned to the country from the US in the early hours of Sunday. Shukla, who piloted the spacecraft to the space station as part of the Axiom-4 mission, was welcomed by Union space minister Jitendra Singh, Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta and Isro chairman V Narayanan, and a large crowd of space enthusiasts at the airport.Posting on X later, minister Jitendra Singh said, “A moment of pride for India! A moment of glory for #ISRO! A moment of gratitude to the dispensation that facilitated this under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. India’s Space glory touches the Indian soil… as the iconic son of Mother India, Gaganyatri Shubhanshu Shukla lands at Delhi in the early hours of morning today. Accompanying him, another equally accomplished Group Captain Prasanth Balakrishnan Nair, one of the astronauts selected for India’s first Human mission Gaganyaan who was India’s designated backup for the mission to the ISS. Privileged to receive both of them”.Shukla is expected to meet PM Modi and then travel to his hometown Lucknow. He is likely to return to the Capital on Aug 22–23 to participate in the National Space Day celebrations.PollShould the Indian government invest more in space exploration?DefinitelyNo, we need to focus on other issuesThe Lok Sabha will hold a special discussion on Monday on India's space journey and Shukla's historic mission aboard the ISS, according to a notice issued by the lower House. The House will discuss “India's first astronaut aboard the ISS — critical role of space programme for Viksit Bharat by 2047”, which could possibly end the deadlock between the govt and opposition in Parliament over the electoral roll revision in Bihar.Earlier on Saturday, Shukla had posted a smiling photograph of himself on a flight and said he was filled with emotions. “As I sit on the plane to come back to India, I have a mix of emotions running through my heart. I feel sad leaving a fantastic group of people behind who were my friends and family for the past one year during this mission. I am also excited about meeting all my friends, family, and everyone in the country for the first time post mission. I guess this is what life is -- everything all at once," he said.In the 79th Independence Day speech at the Red Fort on Friday, PM Modi, while mentioning Group Captain Shukla’s successful mission to ISS, had said that India is working towards becoming self-reliant in the space sector and preparing for the launch of Gaganyaan, its indigenous human space flight mission, and is also working on developing its own space station.In June, Shukla became the second Indian to go to space — after IAF wing commander Rakesh Sharma in 1984— as part of the Axiom-4 mission to the ISS. During the 18-day mission, Shukla, along with astronauts Peggy Whitson (US), Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski (Poland), and Tibor Kapu (Hungary), conducted more than 60 experiments and 20 outreach sessions aboard the ISS. He returned to the Earth on July 16.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous8 best anti-ageing ingredients you should start using in your 20sLifestyle10 best vegetarian sources of IronLifestyleSalwar tales by gorgeous lady Shabana ShajahantvCars under Rs 6 lakh with six airbags: Maruti Alto, Nissan Magnite and moreautoKundali Bhagya fame Shraddha Arya’s stunning ethnic lookstvAnupama Parameswaran shines bright in striking snapsEntertainment'Coolie' actress Reba Monica John’s picture-perfect momentsEntertainmentMalavika Mohanan's stunning style moments you can't missEntertainmentJannat Zubair’s Gen-Z Style is Pure PerfectiontvEver heard of Flying fish?

Unlike optical satellites limited by weather or lighting conditions, NISAR provides continuous, reliable data, making it a game-changer for monitoring glaciers, forests, seismic activity, and farmlands. NASA emphasizes that this technology will revolutionize how nations prepare for disasters and manage resources.The 33-foot antenna, the largest ever used in a NASA Earth science mission, was built by Astro Aerospace, a Northrop Grumman company. Compact at launch, it expanded in orbit into its full umbrella-like shape. Engineers designed it to survive the extreme pressures of launch, the vacuum of space, and constant rotation at 4.5 revolutions per minute. This massive aperture is crucial for generating sharp radar images that will enable groundbreaking scientific studies.Synthetic aperture radar: Seeing the unseenSynthetic aperture radar (SAR) works like a powerful camera lens, simulating a larger antenna to produce high-resolution images. Using interferometric techniques, NISAR can compare radar images over time, creating 3D models of surface changes. These models can reveal subtle shifts such as slow land subsidence, early signs of landslides, or glacier retreat that would otherwise remain invisible. This makes SAR a vital tool for both climate research and urban planning.Global benefits of open dataNISAR’s open data policy ensures that its findings will be freely available to scientists, governments, and humanitarian organizations. From tracking crop cycles to forecasting geological hazards, its data will strengthen global food security and disaster preparedness. With the satellite set to revisit Earth every 12 days, decision-makers will gain access to a steady stream of actionable insights, helping build resilience against climate and environmental challenges.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Researchers successfully translated imagined words into text using brain implants and AI. The study, part of the BrainGate2 trial, demonstrated that brain signals for imagined speech are similar to those for attempted speech.  For decades, neuro-engineers have dreamed of helping people who have been cut off from the world of language. A disease like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, weakens the muscles in the airway. A stroke can kill neurons that normally relay commands for speaking. Perhaps, by implanting electrodes, scientists could record the brain's electric activity and translate that into spoken words.Now a team of researchers has made an important advance toward that goal. Previously they succeeded in decoding the signals produced when people tried to speak. In the new study, published Thursday in the journal Cell, their computer often made correct guesses when the subjects simply imagined saying words.Christian Herff, a neuroscientist at Maastricht University in the Netherlands who was not involved in the research, said the result went beyond the merely technological and shed light on the mystery of language. "It's a fantastic advance," Herff said. The new study is the latest result in a long-running clinical trial, called BrainGate2, that has already seen some remarkable successes.One participant, Casey Harrell, now uses his brain-machine interface to hold conversations. In 2023, after ALS had made his voice unintelligible, Harrell agreed to have electrodes implanted in his brain. A computer recorded the electrical activity from the implants as Harrell attempted to say different words. Over time, with the help of AI, the computer predicted 6,000 words, with 97.5% accuracy.But successes like this raised a troubling question: Could a computer accidentally record more than patients actually wanted to say?Could it eavesdrop on their inner voice? "We wanted to investigate if there was a risk of the system decoding words that weren't meant to be said aloud," said Erin Kunz, a neuroscientist at Stanford University and an author of the study. She and her colleagues also wondered if patients might actually prefer using inner speech.Kunz and her colleagues decided to investigate the mystery for themselves. The scientists gave participants seven different words, including "kite" and "day," then compared the brain signals when participants attempted to say the words and when they only imagined saying them.As it turned out, imagining a word produced a pattern of activity similar to that of trying to say it, but the signal was weaker. The computer did a good job of predicting which of the seven words the participants were thinking. For Harrell, it didn't do much better than a random guess would have, but for another participant it picked the right word more than 70% of the time.The researchers put the computer through more training, this time specifically on inner speech. Its performance improved significantly, including on Harrell. Now when the participants imagined saying entire sentences, such as "I don't know how long you've been here," the computer could accurately decode most of the words.Herff, who has done his own studies, was surprised that the experiment succeeded. Before, he would have said that inner speech is fundamentally different from the motor cortex signals that produce actual speech. "But in this study, they show that, for some people, it isn't that different," he said.Kunz emphasized that the computer's current performance involving inner speech would not be good enough to let people hold conversations. "The results are an initial proof of concept more than anything," she said. But she is optimistic that decoding inner speech could become the new standard for brain-computer interfaces. In recent trials, she and her colleagues have improved the computer's accuracy. "We haven't hit the ceiling yet," she said.

A chance find on an Australian beach has revealed a rare, entirely new species, Janjucetus dullardi, that could unlock new clues about whale evolution.The 25-million-year-old juvenile specimen, small enough to fit in a single bed, was identified in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. It had bulging, tennis-ball-sized eyes, a shark-like snout, and sharp teeth designed for hunting. “It was, let’s say, deceptively cute,” said Erich Fitzgerald, senior curator of vertebrate paleontology at Museums Victoria. “It might have looked like some weird mash-up between a whale, a seal and a Pokémon, but they were very much their own thing.”The partial skull, including ear bones and teeth, was found in 2019 along Victoria’s Jan Juc Beach, a site known for unusual whale fossils. Janjucetus dullardi is only the fourth species ever identified in the mammalodontid group, early whales that lived during the Oligocene Epoch, about 34–23 million years ago. These predators, around three metres long, were an early branch of the lineage that led to modern baleen whales, but looked radically different. “They may have had tiny little nubbins of legs just projecting as stumps,” Fitzgerald said, a mystery that will remain unless a more complete skeleton is found.The species name honours Ross Dullard, the amateur fossil hunter who spotted something black protruding from a cliff during a low-tide search. When he poked it, a tooth fell out. “I thought, geez, we’ve got something special here,” he said. Museums Victoria confirmed this week it was a new species. Dullard, a school principal, said the news was “the greatest 24 hours of my life,” describing rock-star treatment at work with “high fives coming left, right and centre.”This is the first mammalodontid found in Australia since 2006 and only the third in the country. Whale fossils of this quality are rare because most skeletons are lost to erosion, scavengers, and currents over millions of years. “It’s only the chosen few… that actually get preserved as fossils,” Fitzgerald noted.Researchers say Janjucetus dullardi could help reveal how early whales fed, moved, and adapted to ancient warm oceans, insights that could inform how modern marine life responds to climate change. Dullard plans to mark the occasion with a “fossil party” featuring cetacean-themed games and whale-shaped jello, to celebrate his nightmare Muppet find. “I’ve had sleepless nights,” he admitted. “I’ve dreamt about this whale.”About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Researchers used diamond anvil cells and X-ray diffraction to observe mineral behavior under extreme conditions, explaining seismic wave anomalies and linking deep mantle processes to plate tectonics, volcanism, and Earth's magnetic field. Something ‘big’ is moving inside Earth; here’s what scientists just found For decades, scientists have sought to unravel the mysteries hidden deep beneath Earth’s surface. One of the most puzzling regions has been the D" layer, located about 2,700 kilometres (1,700 miles) beneath the surface, at the boundary between the planet’s lower mantle and outer core. This zone has long been known for its unusual seismic properties, which have sparked debates about its composition and behaviour.Now, a groundbreaking study conducted by researchers at ETH Zurich has revealed that solid rock in this deep layer of Earth’s mantle can move like a fluid, while still maintaining its solid state. Led by Professor Motohiko Murakami, the research team has provided experimental evidence explaining how minerals in the D" layer align and deform over geological timescales. The findings, published in Communications Earth & Environment, shed new light on mantle convection, plate tectonics, volcanic activity, and even the generation of Earth’s magnetic field.Earth’s hidden D" layer finally comes into focusThe D" layer sits just above the outer core and plays a key role in the planet’s internal dynamics. It has been a focal point for geoscientists because seismic waves passing through it behave differently than expected, often travelling faster in some regions and slower in others. Understanding the cause of these variations has been a challenge, as conditions in this layer involve extreme pressures and temperatures that are difficult to replicate in laboratory experiments.To study the D" layer, Murakami’s team used diamond anvil cells—devices capable of generating pressures exceeding those found deep within Earth—and X-ray diffraction techniques to examine the atomic structure of minerals under such conditions.The researchers recreated the high-pressure, high-temperature environment of the D" layer and observed how minerals behaved. They used magnesium germanate crystals as an experimental analogue for mantle minerals because they exhibit similar structural properties but are easier to work with in the lab.Role of post-perovskite in mantle dynamicsThe study focused on post-perovskite, a high-pressure phase of the mineral perovskite that forms under the extreme conditions of the D" layer. Post-perovskite has unique structural properties that allow its crystals to align in specific patterns when subjected to geological stress over long periods.This alignment enables solid-state flow, a process in which solid rock deforms and moves like a viscous fluid without melting. Such movement plays a critical role in mantle convection—the slow circulation of rock that drives the movement of tectonic plates at Earth’s surface.Explaining seismic wave anomaliesOne of the major outcomes of the research is the explanation for why seismic waves can accelerate by up to seven percent when passing through certain regions of the D" layer. The alignment of post-perovskite crystals changes the way seismic energy travels through the rock, matching patterns observed in global seismological data.This discovery effectively resolves a long-standing puzzle in geophysics and provides a clear link between deep mantle mineral behaviour and surface-level seismic measurements.Impact on plate tectonics and volcanismThe movement of solid rock in the D" layer has significant implications for plate tectonics. Mantle plumes—columns of hot rock rising from deep within the Earth—can be guided by the alignment of post-perovskite minerals, directing heat and material toward the upper mantle and crust.These processes are responsible for creating volcanic hotspots such as those in Hawaii and Iceland. The study also helps explain how deep mantle processes influence the formation of mountain ranges and the activity along subduction zones where one tectonic plate slides beneath another.Connection to Earth’s magnetic fieldBeyond plate tectonics, the findings have important implications for understanding the geodynamo—the mechanism that generates Earth’s magnetic field. The distribution of heat from the deep mantle to the outer core affects convection within the liquid iron core, which in turn influences magnetic field generation.By showing how the D" layer channels heat through solid-state flow, the study reveals a previously underappreciated link between deep mantle processes and the stability and variations of Earth’s magnetic field over the past 200 million years. This breakthrough opens new pathways for future research into how Earth’s deep interior continues to shape the planet’s surface and long-term habitability.Methodology and experimental insightsMurakami’s team achieved their results by:Using diamond anvil cells to create pressures of hundreds of gigapascals, similar to those at the core-mantle boundary.Applying high-temperature lasers to simulate the intense heat found deep underground.Analysing the crystal structures with synchrotron X-ray diffraction to observe how minerals deform under such conditions.Studying magnesium germanate as a stand-in for mantle perovskite allows the researchers to observe mineral alignment and flow properties.Significance for Earth scienceThe discovery that solid rock can behave like a fluid deep within the Earth provides:A more complete model of mantle convection and its effects on surface geology.An explanation for seismic anomalies detected in the D" layer.New insights into the heat flow between Earth’s core and mantle.A better understanding of how mantle plumes form and influence volcanism.A link between deep Earth processes and magnetic field generation.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

NASA captured 10 mysterious dark voids over remote island near Antarctica: What they reveal about the bizarre natural phenomena
In May 2016, NASA satellites detected ten unusual dark voids within cloud cover above Heard Island, a remote volcanic landmass. These formations, linked to von Kármán vortices, exhibited an atypical darkness, tight spiral structure, and a sharp directional change. This rare event provides scientists with a unique opportunity to study small-island wind effects and their impact on atmospheric patterns.

These formations, linked to von Kármán vortices, exhibited an atypical darkness, tight spiral structure, and a sharp directional change. This rare event provides scientists with a unique opportunity to study small-island wind effects and their impact on atmospheric patterns.  NASA satellites have captured a rare and eerie sight: 10 swirling “dark voids” puncturing thick cloud cover above Heard Island, an isolated volcanic landmass in the southern Indian Ocean, around 900 miles (1,500 km) north of Antarctica. The black patches, each averaging 8 miles (13 km) wide, formed in May 2016 and appear as part of an unusual atmospheric pattern. While these formations are linked to von Karman vortices, swirling air currents formed when wind passes around a tall obstacle, scientists note their unusual darkness, tight spiral structure, and dramatic change in direction make this event exceptional.The 10 dark voids show isolation’s impact on rare weatherThe 10 massive dark voids, captured in May 2016, are a striking example of how Heard Island’s extreme environment fuels rare atmospheric phenomena. This uninhabited Australian territory lies in one of the most remote and storm-battered regions on Earth, within the “Furious Fifties,” where powerful westerly winds dominate. Towering above the island is Mawson Peak, a 9,000-foot (2,700-meter) active volcano that disrupts airflow and cloud formations. The combination of volcanic terrain, fierce winds, and the island’s isolation provides perfect conditions for unusual cloud patterns, but seeing them so distinctly in satellite imagery is extraordinarily rare.Von Karman vortices: Nature’s swirling wind patternsVon Karman vortices form when fast-moving winds encounter an obstacle, such as an island or mountain, disrupting airflow and creating alternating spinning eddies on either side. These patterns are named after physicist Theodore von Karman, who first described the phenomenon. While von Karman vortices are occasionally observed in other regions of the world, such as the Canary Islands or Guadalupe Island, they usually appear as long, wispy trails of clouds. The vortices over Heard Island were instead marked by dense, perfectly circular gaps in the clouds, making this event stand out from typical occurrences.Unusual shape and sharp bend make it uniqueMost von Karman vortex streams appear smooth and aligned, flowing in a consistent direction. In contrast, the May 2016 formation over Heard Island bent sharply by nearly 90 degrees midstream, an abrupt shift likely triggered by intense westerly winds exceeding 50 mph (80 km/h). Additionally, the presence of thick clouds meant that only the vortex cores were visible, creating the illusion of black voids in the sky. This combination of strong winds, sudden directional change, and isolated visibility of the vortex centers is rarely seen in satellite imagery. Such extraordinary formations provide scientists with valuable insights into extreme weather behavior in isolated regions.A rare chance to study small-island wind effectsBecause Mawson Peak is smaller than most peaks that generate von Karman vortices, such patterns in this location are uncommon. This event offered researchers a rare opportunity to analyze how atmospheric flows interact with smaller volcanic landmasses. Studying these effects can improve understanding of how wind patterns influence global weather systems, climate, and even the transport of airborne particles across oceans. The Heard Island vortices also highlight how relatively minor topographic features can cause significant disturbances in large-scale airflow under the right conditions.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

This follows closely after an Indian astronaut's visit to the International Space Station. (Photo: X) NEW DELHI: In a landmark achievement, India has successfully sent its aquanauts to depths of over 5,000 metres in the North Atlantic Ocean.The mission marked a major step towards the country’s Deep Ocean Mission, also known as Samudrayaan. The feat comes just weeks after Shubhanshu Shukla became the first Indian to reach the International Space Station.Historic Moment: Shubhanshu Shukla Touches Down Earth With Spashdown Off U.S. Coast | Axiom-4The expedition was carried out in collaboration with France and involved two Indian aquanauts who completed separate deep dives in the French submersible Nautile earlier this month.PollWhich achievement do you think is more significant for India's scientific progress?Diving over 5,000 metres in the oceanReaching the International Space StationOn 5 August, Raju Ramesh, a scientist at the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), descended 4,025 metres. A record-setting 5,002-metre dive by retired Navy Commander Jatinder Pal Singh the next day followed this.Union Earth Sciences Minister Jitendra Singh said, "We have an Indian going into space and an Indian going into the deep ocean almost simultaneously." He called it part of India’s “double conquest” in underexplored frontiers, which he believes will contribute to the country’s economic growth.The minister added that PM Narendra Modi has shown a strong interest in the Deep Ocean Mission and blue economy.The Deep Ocean Mission, cleared by the Union Cabinet in 2021, covers crewed and uncrewed submersibles, deep-sea mining technology, biodiversity research and ocean-based energy projects. It aims to explore and utilise resources within India’s Exclusive Economic Zone and continental shelf.Matsya 6000M Ravichandran, Secretary in the ministry of Earth sciences, said the Deep Ocean Mission was carried out to gain firsthand experience before India tries the same with its own submersible, Matsya 6000. "One of the verticals of the DOM aims to develop technology to harness non-living ocean resources and a submersible which can carry humans to the deepest parts of the ocean for exploration," he said.The Matsya 6000, likely to be ready by December 2027, will carry three people to depths of 6,000 metres inside a titanium alloy sphere. It will have scientific instruments, communication systems and safety features with emergency endurance of up to 96 hours.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Source: X NASA astronaut Don Pettit has shared a striking near-infrared image of the Ganga River delta on X (formerly Twitter), captured during his Expedition 73 mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Posted on social media, the image provides a rare, high-contrast perspective of the world’s largest river delta, showcasing the vast, fertile landscapes across eastern India and Bangladesh. The photograph highlights the power of space-based observation in understanding Earth’s geography and the delicate ecosystems that sustain millions of people in the region.NASA astronaut captures Ganga river delta: Near-infrared photography reveals hidden ecosystem featuresPettit captured the delta using near-infrared photography, a technique that highlights features invisible to the human eye. Healthy vegetation appears luminous, while rivers, marshes, and agricultural land stand out with remarkable clarity. Scientists use these images to monitor plant health, water distribution, and environmental changes over time. By revealing fine details of the landscape, near-infrared photography allows researchers to track the effects of climate change, urbanisation, and deforestation, providing crucial data to protect this vital ecosystem.Accompanying the image, Pettit described the region as “the largest river delta on Earth,” underscoring both its geographical significance and natural splendour. The photograph quickly drew admiration from scientists, nature lovers, and photography enthusiasts alike and was praised for blending technical precision with artistic expression.Beyond its scientific value, Pettit’s photograph has captured attention for its visual appeal. The glowing greenery, winding rivers, and patchwork of farmland create a composition that blends art and science seamlessly. Social media users and science communities alike have praised the image, noting both its technical precision and aesthetic beauty. Pettit’s work highlights how space photography can inspire curiosity and appreciation for Earth’s landscapes, offering a perspective rarely seen from the ground.The Ganga-Brahmaputra delta: Asia’s largest river delta and vital biodiversity hotspotThe Ganga or Ganges delta, also called the Bengal Delta or Sundarbans Delta, covers more than 100,000 square kilometres and flows into the Bay of Bengal. It is home to millions who depend on its rich soils for agriculture, and it contains the UNESCO-listed Sundarbans mangrove forest. This unique ecosystem provides a habitat for endangered species like the Bengal tiger and supports biodiversity through its dense forests and interwoven waterways. Seasonal flooding replenishes nutrients in the soil, creating highly productive farmland, but also poses challenges for communities living in the delta.The Ganga river delta: Vital ecosystem and environmental stabilityThe Ganga river delta is not only vital for human livelihoods but also plays a crucial role in environmental stability. Its wetlands act as natural buffers against floods, while mangroves prevent coastal erosion and storm damage. These tools also assist in assessing biodiversity, identifying areas of habitat loss, and planning sustainable conservation efforts to protect both wildlife and local communities. Satellite and aerial imagery help scientists monitor these ecosystems, track seasonal flooding, and study the impact of climate change. Pettit’s near-infrared photograph contributes to this research by providing a detailed view of vegetation and land use, complementing other scientific tools used to safeguard the delta’s delicate balance.NASA astronaut Don Pettit’s near-infrared images of the Ganga river delta provide a striking perspective on one of the world’s most vital and expansive ecosystems. Covering over 100,000 square kilometres, the delta sustains millions of people, supports rich biodiversity, and safeguards coastal regions from natural disasters. Pettit’s work combines scientific observation with artistic vision, emphasising the importance of monitoring waterways, vegetation, and ecological health from space. Such imagery not only showcases the beauty and fragility of our planet but also inspires greater environmental awareness, highlighting the urgent need for conservation and fostering a deeper global appreciation of Earth’s natural landscapes.Also Read: NASA and Google collaborating together to develop AI medical assistant to boost astronaut health on Moon and Mars missionsAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

He was aided by Tiffany Fowler and Shae Saur. The stolen rocks were valued at $21 million. Roberts claimed it was for love, but the FBI found he planned to sell them. Roberts and his accomplices were arrested. The heist damaged scientific research. Source: LADbible In one of the most audacious and bizarre crimes in NASA history, Thad Roberts, a 24-year-old intern, stole moon rocks valued at $21 million in 2002, driven by romance rather than greed. Alongside his girlfriend Tiffany Fowler and fellow intern Shae Saur, Roberts executed a meticulously planned burglary at Houston’s Johnson Space Center, using authentic NASA badges, rewired security cameras, and Neoprene suits to bypass alarms. Their theft of 17 pounds of lunar samples included historic moon rocks from Apollo missions 1969–1972. While Roberts claimed the act was “for love,” the FBI revealed he had attempted to sell the rocks secretly online. This extraordinary heist destroyed priceless scientific research, embarrassed NASA, and shocked the world, blending science, crime, and obsession in an unforgettable story.$21 million moon rock theft at Johnson Space Center shocks scientists worldwideOn a July night in 2002, Roberts, Fowler, and Saur infiltrated Building 31 at Johnson Space Center. Roberts and Fowler donned Neoprene bodysuits, which allowed them to bypass thermal alarms, while Saur acted as a lookout. Using a power saw, they cracked open a 601-pound safe containing moon rocks and meteorites, including samples from every Apollo mission, many of which were irreplaceable and scientifically invaluable. The stolen lunar samples were worth approximately $21 million and represented decades of scientific research, experimentation, and NASA missions. The planning and execution demonstrated not only audacity but also technical sophistication, showing how a combination of insider knowledge, meticulous preparation, and determination can circumvent the most secure facilities. Source: Live ScienceWho is Thad Roberts? From NASA Intern to mastermind behind the $21 million moon rock theftThad Roberts graduated from the University of Utah with a triple degree in physics, geology, and geophysics, making him highly qualified to work at NASA. He met Tiffany Fowler, a 22-year-old stem cell researcher, and the couple quickly became romantically involved. Roberts reportedly told Fowler he wanted to “give her the moon,” framing the theft as a grand romantic gesture. According to People.com , the FBI considered financial motives, Roberts maintained that the act symbolized devotion rather than profit.Moon rock theft ends with FBI arrests and millions in NASA lunar samples lostRoberts and Fowler’s motivation went beyond romance—they symbolically “had sex on the moon” by placing stolen lunar samples under a blanket during intimate moments. Roberts later stated, “No one had ever had sex on the moon before,” underscoring the bizarre, almost surreal nature of the crime. While Roberts claimed love was the driving factor, the FBI discovered he had negotiated with a Belgian buyer willing to pay up to $5,000 per gram, proving the theft had financial implications.The heist came to a dramatic end when Roberts and Fowler traveled to Orlando to meet the potential buyer, only to be apprehended by undercover FBI agents. Saur and Gordon McWhorter, who helped arrange the sale, were arrested shortly afterward. The investigation revealed that the theft had caused irreversible damage: the moon rocks were now “virtually useless to the scientific community,” and three decades of NASA research notes were destroyed as reported.Moon rock theft from NASA leads to jail, house arrest, and finesThad Roberts pleaded guilty to the theft of moon rocks and other NASA artifacts, serving over six years of an eight-year prison sentence before his release in 2008. Tiffany Fowler and Shae Saur received house arrest, community service, and were required to pay restitution to NASA. Gordon McWhorter was convicted at trial for his involvement in the theft and sentenced to six years in prison. The case highlighted serious security breaches and led to stricter controls on NASA’s valuable collections.Also Read | NASA and Google collaborating together to boost astronaut health on Moon and Mars missionsAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Bermuda Triangle ‘mystery’ solved? Scientist explains the real cause behind vanishings of ships and planes
The Bermuda Triangle's infamous reputation for unexplained disappearances is largely unfounded, according to scientist Karl Kruszelnicki and supported by NOAA and Lloyd's of London. The region's high traffic volume, combined with challenging environmental conditions like the Gulf Stream and frequent storms, accounts for the incidents. Human error and equipment failure also play significant roles, debunking myths of supernatural forces.

Scientist explains the real cause behind vanishings of ships and planesTOI Science Desk / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Updated: Aug 14, 2025, 10:01 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLargeThe Bermuda Triangle's infamous reputation for unexplained disappearances is largely unfounded, according to scientist Karl Kruszelnicki and supported by NOAA and Lloyd's of London. The region's high traffic volume, combined with challenging environmental conditions like the Gulf Stream and frequent storms, accounts for the incidents. Human error and equipment failure also play significant roles, debunking myths of supernatural forces. Image: Getty Images  For decades, the Bermuda Triangle, the stretch of ocean roughly bounded by Miami, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico, has been the subject of mystery, fear, and speculation. From tales of ships vanishing without a trace to aircraft disappearing mid-flight, the region has inspired theories about supernatural forces, alien abductions, and even time warps. But according to Australian scientist Karl Kruszelnicki, backed by research from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Lloyd’s of London, these myths do not hold up. Far from being a cursed zone, the Bermuda Triangle’s so-called mysteries can be explained by natural environmental conditions, human error, and statistical probability. The truth, Kruszelnicki emphasizes, is far less otherworldly and far more rooted in the realities of nature and navigation.Bermuda Triangle poses no greater risk than other oceansKruszelnicki, supported by NOAA and Lloyd’s of London, has long maintained that the Bermuda Triangle is no more dangerous than any other ocean region. Disappearances occur at roughly the same proportional rate as elsewhere in the world’s waters. As noted by Kruszelnicki, the higher number of incidents is largely due to the Triangle being one of the busiest shipping and flight corridors in the world, where heavy traffic naturally means more recorded accidents. Statistical data confirms that when the volume of vessels and aircraft is taken into account, the accident rate is completely ordinary. This directly challenges the very foundation of the Triangle’s mythical reputation.Environmental and navigational challenges of 'Bermuda Triangle'According to Kruszelnicki, the geography and weather patterns of the Bermuda Triangle create conditions that can challenge even experienced navigators. The Gulf Stream, a powerful ocean current, can cause sudden changes in weather, generate violent storms, and push vessels off course within minutes. The region is also prone to tropical storms, hurricanes, waterspouts, and rogue waves that can overwhelm ships and planes without warning. Numerous islands and coral reefs make for hazardous, shallow navigation routes, increasing the risk of grounding or collision. Kruszelnicki also points out that certain areas experience magnetic anomalies where compasses may point to true north instead of magnetic north, leading to potential navigation errors. Furthermore, unpredictable microbursts and rapidly forming squalls can make navigation extremely hazardous, even for experienced crews. Sudden changes in visibility and wind patterns have historically contributed to numerous near-miss incidents in the area. When all these factors combine, even a minor miscalculation can turn deadly.Human error and equipment failureAs Kruszelnicki explains, a significant number of accidents in the Bermuda Triangle can be traced to pilot or captain mistakes, faulty equipment, or outdated forecasting methods. These human and technical shortcomings often occur alongside the already challenging weather and navigational conditions of the region. In earlier decades, limited communication systems and slower emergency response times meant that vessels or aircraft in trouble had little chance of rescue. Even today, with advanced technology, mistakes and malfunctions can quickly escalate into disasters when compounded by sudden storms or rough seas. Kruszelnicki stresses that the human factor is often underestimated in popular explanations of the Triangle’s incidents.Origins of the myth of the Bermuda Triangle The term “Bermuda Triangle” was first coined in 1963 by writer Vincent Gaddis, who linked the region to a series of unexplained disappearances. His writings sparked public curiosity, but the myth gained massive momentum in 1974 when author Charles Berlitz published a bestselling book that embellished these stories with speculation about Atlantis, alien abductions, and other sensational claims. Kruszelnicki has often criticized such accounts for their lack of credible evidence and reliance on anecdotal storytelling. The entertainment value of the myth overshadowed scientific explanations, cementing its place in pop culture for generations despite the absence of verifiable proof.Famous anecdote – the Bruce Gernon storyIn 1970, pilot Bruce Gernon reported encountering a strange tunnel-like cloud while flying through the Bermuda Triangle. He claimed his instruments malfunctioned, and upon exiting the cloud, he experienced a time discrepancy of about 30 minutes. The story has been widely discussed in books, documentaries, and paranormal circles, with some suggesting it could be evidence of a time warp. Kruszelnicki, however, remains skeptical, noting that the account is anecdotal and lacks corroborating evidence. Many experts, including Kruszelnicki, believe it could be explained by meteorological phenomena such as unusual cloud formations or optical illusions.Scientific consensus over Bermuda TriangleThe conclusion from NOAA, the US Navy, and Lloyd’s of London — all echoed by Kruszelnicki — is clear: the Bermuda Triangle is not more hazardous than any other heavily traveled ocean region. The so-called mystery is a product of natural hazards, geographic challenges, human mistakes, and decades of exaggerated storytelling. Statistically, the accident rates are consistent with those in other busy maritime and aviation areas. While the legend of the Bermuda Triangle may continue to inspire curiosity and creativity, the evidence, as Kruszelnicki emphasizes, points to a reality grounded in science, not the supernatural. Ultimately, the Bermuda Triangle’s greatest power lies not in sinking ships, but in captivating imaginations. It is a reminder that mystery often thrives where facts are overlooked, and that reality can be just as fascinating as myth.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

This ancient water, isolated for millennia, provides unprecedented insights into Earth's early conditions and potential for life in extreme environments. Professor Barbara Sherwood Lollar's team's findings challenge existing assumptions and open new avenues for astrobiological research.  In 2016, scientists discovered the oldest water on Earth deep within a Canadian mine, estimated to be over 2 billion years old. This rare water had been trapped underground, isolated from surface influences, offering unique insights into Earth’s ancient geological past and extreme environments. Professor Barbara Sherwood Lollar and her team made this remarkable discovery in the Kidd Creek Mine in Ontario, Canada. The water's extraordinary age and composition have important implications for understanding subterranean ecosystems and the possibility of life in harsh conditions, including on other planets.This finding marks a groundbreaking moment in geology and astrobiology, revealing how Earth’s deepest waters can hold secrets from billions of years ago.Discovery of the oldest water on Earth in Kidd Creek MineThe oldest water on Earth was uncovered at a depth of about 3 kilometers in the Kidd Creek Mine, Ontario. This water had remained sealed away for roughly 1.5 to 2.6 billion years, surpassing previous finds of ancient water worldwide. The research team, led by geologist Barbara Sherwood Lollar, tested the water’s age using isotopic analysis, confirming its unprecedented age. The longevity and isolation of this water make it a living snapshot of early Earth conditions, preserved untouched for billions of years.This groundbreaking discovery and detailed scientific analysis were published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications in 2014, offering a comprehensive look at the water’s age, chemistry, and significance. The findings challenge previous assumptions about Earth’s hydrological cycles and open new questions about the movement and preservation of water in the planet’s deep crust.Scientific importance of the oldest water on earth discoveryFinding the oldest water on Earth has major scientific significance. It offers clues about how microbial life could survive in isolated environments for billions of years, far from sunlight. This challenges previous assumptions about life’s limits on Earth and extends hope for discovering life in similar extraterrestrial environments, such as Mars or icy moons like Europa. The high salinity and unique chemical composition of this ancient water also provide insight into geological processes that occurred billions of years ago. These findings expand our understanding of Earth’s deep biosphere and the resilience of life. Moreover, studying such ancient water helps scientists understand how life might adapt to extreme conditions, pushing the boundaries of astrobiology and earth sciences.Tasting the oldest water on earth: A geologist’s unique experienceIn a remarkable gesture, Professor Sherwood Lollar tasted the oldest water on Earth herself.

Woman astronomer paid 30 cents an hour: unlocked cosmic distances; still missed out on Nobel Prize
Henrietta Swan Leavitt worked as a Harvard “computer” earning just 30 cents an hour, yet her groundbreaking discovery of the period-luminosity relationship transformed astronomy. Her work enabled scientists to measure cosmic distances and understand the expanding universe. Despite this monumental contribution, Leavitt never received a Nobel Prize during her lifetime, highlighting the challenges faced by women in science.

Her work enabled scientists to measure cosmic distances and understand the expanding universe. Despite this monumental contribution, Leavitt never received a Nobel Prize during her lifetime, highlighting the challenges faced by women in science.  Henrietta Swan Leavitt, an American astronomer whose groundbreaking discovery revolutionized how we measure the cosmos. Born in 1868, Leavitt began working at the Harvard College Observatory at a time when women were excluded from operating telescopes and instead employed as “computers” to analyze astronomical data. Despite earning just 30 cents an hour, her dedication and meticulous research led to one of the most important astronomical breakthroughs of the 20th century.In 1908, Leavitt discovered the period-luminosity relationship of Cepheid variable stars, showing a direct link between their brightness and pulsation period. This discovery became the key to measuring vast cosmic distances and ultimately helped astronomers like Edwin Hubble prove that the universe is expanding. Yet, despite her monumental contributions, Leavitt was never awarded a Nobel Prize during her lifetime.The discovery that changed astronomy foreverLeavitt’s key insight came from studying Cepheid variable stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, a galaxy assumed to be at a uniform distance from Earth. By carefully analyzing photographic plates, she found that the brightness of these stars varied in a predictable way tied to their pulsation period: the longer the period, the brighter the star. This relationship, now known as Leavitt’s Law, gave astronomers a powerful “standard candle,” an object of known brightness that can be used to calculate distances in space.Using this standard candle method, astronomers could measure how far away these stars and by extension, the galaxies they reside in actually were. This was a breakthrough in cosmic distance measurement, allowing scientists to determine the scale of the universe with unprecedented accuracy. Leavitt’s discovery became the foundation for Edwin Hubble’s later work in the 1920s where he used Cepheid variables to prove that the Milky Way was just one of many galaxies and that the universe itself was expanding.Overcoming barriers as a woman in scienceHenrietta Swan Leavitt’s career unfolded during a time when women faced serious discrimination in science. Women were largely relegated to supportive roles and denied opportunities such as telescope operation and academic recognition. Leavitt was paid a modest wage of about 30 cents an hour as a “computer” at Harvard, tasked with analyzing star data rather than conducting independent research.Despite these limitations, she showed extraordinary focus and persistence. Leavitt’s progressive hearing loss later in life made her work even more challenging, yet she continued her observations and calculations until her untimely death at the age of 53. Tragically, although her work was foundational for modern astronomy, she never received the Nobel Prize or equivalent accolades during her lifetime, and a posthumous nomination was not permitted.Legacy and lasting impact on cosmologyLeavitt’s period-luminosity relationship remains one of the cornerstones of astrophysics. It revolutionized the way distances to faraway celestial objects are measured, enabling astronomers to map the universe on a grand scale. This method underpins modern cosmology, helping scientists determine not only distances but also the rate at which the universe is expanding, key to the Big Bang theory.Edwin Hubble famously used Leavitt’s discovery to measure the distances to galaxies beyond the Milky Way and uncover the expanding nature of the universe, a milestone that forever changed humanity’s understanding of our place in the cosmos. Today, Henrietta Swan Leavitt is celebrated as a pioneering figure in astronomy whose brilliance and perseverance overcame societal and physical obstacles, leaving a profound legacy that continues to guide scientific exploration.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

These magnetic nanobots address tooth sensitivity. CalBots seal dentinal tubules using a bioceramic formula. Tests on extracted teeth show promising results. Animal trials demonstrate complete behavioral recovery. The team sees this as a step towards advanced nanorobotics. This innovation offers lasting relief for millions. The CalBots are made from safe materials.  BENGALURU: For millions of people, the sudden, sharp pain of tooth sensitivity can turn a sip of cold water into a jolt. Now, researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), in collaboration with Bengaluru-based deep-tech startup Theranautilus, have engineered “CalBots” – magnetic nanobots that can seal the problem at its source.As per IISc, CalBots are 400-nanometre particles loaded with a calcium silicate-based bioceramic formula, designed to travel deep inside dentinal tubules, the tiny tunnels in the tooth that lead to nerve endings. Guided by an external magnetic field, the bots can penetrate up to 500 micrometres into the tubules and self-assemble into stable, cement-like plugs that recreate the tooth’s natural barrier. One application, the team says, can offer lasting relief.Dental hypersensitivity affects nearly one in four people worldwide and occurs when enamel erosion or gum recession exposes the dentine layer beneath, IISc said. The tubules in dentine act as direct pathways to the nerves, which is why even mild temperature changes can trigger pain. “We didn’t want to create a slightly better version of what’s already out there. We wanted a technology that solves a real problem in a way that no one’s attempted before,” Shanmukh Peddi, postdoctoral researcher at IISc’s Centre for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE) and co-founder of Theranautilus. The team used a completely new class of bioceramic cement for the nanobots. While bioceramics are common in orthopaedics and dentistry, the formulation was designed specifically for hypersensitivity – to travel deeper and last longer.To test the approach, they worked first on extracted human teeth. “On these samples, we applied CalBots under a magnetic field for 20 minutes, during which the bots sealed the dentinal tubules by forming deep, stable plugs – a result confirmed through high-resolution imaging,” Peddi said.They then moved to animal trials, inducing sensitivity in mice and tracking their drinking behaviour. “Healthy mice drank both cold and room temperature water equally. But sensitive mice completely avoided cold water. After treatment, they started drinking it again. We saw 100% behavioural recovery. That was a big moment for us,” he said.The CalBots are made entirely from materials classified as ‘Generally Recognised as Safe’ and passed toxicity tests in mice. “This is a compelling demonstration of what nanorobotics can achieve, and how they could significantly impact future healthcare,” said Ambarish Ghosh, professor at CeNSE and one of the study’s corresponding authors.Debayan Dasgupta, former PhD student at CeNSE and co-founder of Theranautilus, sees this as part of a bigger technological shift. “We’ve created a regenerative, active nanomaterial – a step towards the kind of ‘tiny mechanical surgeons’ Richard Feynman once envisioned,” he said.Peddi added: “This is something we’ve worked towards silently for years. And the fact that we’ve done it here, in India, makes us very happy.”About the AuthorChethan KumarChethan Kumar is a Senior Assistant Editor with the Times of India.

Though smaller than initially thought, it remains the largest interstellar visitor known. Confirmed as a comet with a glowing tail, 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be twice as old as our solar system, offering a glimpse into the early universe.  NASA has revealed exciting new information about a mysterious interstellar object called 3I/ATLAS, speeding through our solar system at extraordinary velocities. First detected on July 1, this visitor from beyond our star system has fascinated scientists globally with its astonishing speed of 130,000 miles per hour and intriguing characteristics. Recent observations from the Hubble Space Telescope have captured the clearest images to date, offering key insights into its size, makeup, and path. These discoveries represent a significant advancement in our understanding of these rare travelers crossing the galaxy into our cosmic neighborhood.NASA confirms 3I/ATLAS as the fastest interstellar object ever detectedNASA’s Hubble Space Telescope observations have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is travelling through our solar system at an extraordinary speed of 130,000 miles per hour (209,000 km/h), making it the fastest interstellar object ever recorded. This speed far exceeds that of previous interstellar visitors such as ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. Scientists explain that the object’s velocity is the result of billions of years of gravitational interactions, known as the “gravitational slingshot effect,” where passing stars, planets, and nebulae impart additional momentum to the comet. This extreme speed means the object is only briefly visible as it races through, providing a fleeting window of opportunity for study. NASA’s continuous monitoring aims to capture as much data as possible during its swift passage.Image: Daily MailSize estimates refined: NASA reveals 3I/ATLAS is smaller but still immenseInitial observations by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory suggested that 3I/ATLAS’s icy core might be around seven miles (11.2 km) wide. However, NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has now refined these estimates, revealing that the core is smaller — at most 3.5 miles (5.6 km) across, and possibly as little as 1,000 feet (320 meters) in diameter. Despite being smaller than first believed, this still makes 3I/ATLAS the largest interstellar object ever discovered, dwarfing the next largest known visitor by up to 14 times. The high-resolution images also highlight the comet’s glowing gas halo, which had made it appear larger in earlier, less detailed observations. Understanding the true size helps scientists model its composition and behavior as it interacts with solar radiation.NASA confirms 3I/ATLAS’s cometary nature and its spectacular glowing tailThanks to NASA’s powerful telescopes, scientists have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is not a solid rock but a comet — a chunk of ice, frozen gases, and dust surrounded by a halo of evaporating material. The Hubble images reveal a dust plume streaming from the side of the comet heated by the Sun, along with a faint tail trailing behind it. This tail is formed as the comet’s surface warms up, causing ice to vaporize and release gas and dust into space, creating the characteristic glowing appearance. This phenomenon is similar to that seen in comets within our solar system, but 3I/ATLAS’s interstellar origin and extreme speed make it a rare and valuable subject for study. NASA expects the tail and dust plume to become more pronounced as the object approaches its closest point to the Sun. Scientists hope continued observation will shed light on the comet’s chemical composition, helping reveal clues about its interstellar origins. 3I/ATLAS offers humanity a fleeting glimpse into the mysteries of other star systems, carrying secrets older than our Sun itself.Ancient traveler: NASA estimates 3I/ATLAS is twice as old as our solar systemOne of the most astonishing revelations from NASA’s studies is the estimated age of 3I/ATLAS. Scientific analysis suggests this object has been orbiting the Milky Way for at least eight billion years — roughly twice the age of our own 4.6 billion-year-old solar system. This implies 3I/ATLAS formed long before our Sun and planets came into existence, making it a true cosmic relic. Its journey through the galaxy has likely included multiple gravitational encounters with stars and interstellar clouds, which may have shaped its trajectory and speed. Studying such an ancient object offers scientists a unique glimpse into the conditions and materials present in the early universe and helps refine models of galactic evolution. Its fleeting passage is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to study a messenger from the galaxy’s distant past. NASA researchers emphasize that each discovery from 3I/ATLAS brings us closer to understanding how planetary systems form and evolve across the galaxy.Safe passage confirmed by NASA: No threat to EarthDespite its immense speed and close approach to the Sun, NASA has assured the public that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth. The comet will reach its closest point to the Sun in late October, passing just inside the orbit of Mars at about 130 million miles (210 million kilometers). Crucially, it will be on the opposite side of the Sun relative to Earth during this time, ensuring no risk of collision or gravitational disturbance. NASA continues to monitor the comet’s trajectory precisely, as the interaction with the Sun’s heat may slightly alter its path. After passing the Sun, 3I/ATLAS will head back out into interstellar space, continuing its long journey through the galaxy. This may be humanity’s only chance to witness this ancient traveler before it disappears forever into the cosmic void. Its fleeting visit serves as a reminder of the vast, mysterious, and ever-changing nature of our universe.A new era of discovery: NASA leads the charge in interstellar object research3I/ATLAS marks only the third confirmed interstellar object ever detected, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. NASA’s advancements in telescope technology, sky surveys, and space observatories like Hubble have ushered in a new era of interstellar discovery. Researchers expect that as survey instruments become more sensitive and comprehensive, the frequency of detecting such visitors will increase. NASA plans to utilize not only Hubble but also the James Webb Space Telescope, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory to study 3I/ATLAS in multiple wavelengths. This will allow scientists to capture unprecedented data on the object's composition and interaction with the solar environment. These coordinated observations are crucial for building a more complete picture of interstellar objects and their origins. This coordinated effort will deepen our understanding of the composition, origin, and behavior of interstellar objects and their role in the cosmic ecosystem.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

These massive structures, sculpted by ancient underwater avalanches, indicate the Atlantic Ocean connected earlier than previously thought. This discovery provides insights into Cretaceous climate shifts and tectonic movements, offering crucial data for modern geology and climate science.  Buried nearly a kilometre beneath the Atlantic seabed west of Guinea-Bissau lies a geological time-capsule: gigantic 117-million-year-old mud waves sculpted by dense, underwater avalanches. A new study published in Global and Planetary Change reveals that these ancient structures were formed when early Atlantic waters carved through the Earth’s crust, much earlier than previously believed. This groundbreaking discovery reshapes our understanding of Atlantic Ocean formation, offers fresh perspectives on Cretaceous climate shifts, and provides crucial clues to tectonic movements that governed our planet’s evolving geography. From deep-sea sediment patterns to global carbon cycles and ocean circulation, these mud waves, once hidden, now tell a story with far-reaching implications for modern geology and climate science.Underwater mud waves push the Atlantic's birth date back to 117 million years agoRecent research published in Global and Planetary Change (2025) by Duarte, Nicholson, and colleagues has shed new light on the early history of the Atlantic Ocean. Using a combination of modern seismic imaging and archived drilling data from 1975, the team identified a series of massive 117-million-year-old mud waves buried deep beneath the Atlantic seafloor. These geological giants, stretching over a kilometer in length and rising hundreds of meters high, were formed when dense, salty water from the young North Atlantic spilled into the deeper southern basins, creating powerful underwater currents. The composition and layering of these mud waves reveal that such flows occurred far earlier than previously believed, suggesting that the Equatorial Atlantic Gateway, the oceanic passage linking the northern and southern Atlantic opened sooner than most geological models predicted. This pushes back the estimated timeline of when the Atlantic became a fully connected ocean, making the discovery a crucial piece in reconstructing Earth’s plate tectonic and oceanographic history. Not only does this finding refine our understanding of how and when the Atlantic took shape, but it also offers insights into the role of deep-water currents in shaping the seafloor over millions of years.Sediment patterns illuminate early ocean currents and climate changeThe formation of these 117-million-year-old mud waves was far more than an isolated ocean-floor event, it represented a profound turning point in Earth’s climate and geological history. When the young North Atlantic’s saline waters finally breached into the long-isolated southern basins, they encountered dense, carbon-rich deep waters that had been locked away for millions of years. This sudden mixing unleashed colossal underwater mud avalanches, cascading across the seabed with immense force and reshaping the ocean floor’s topography on a scale rarely seen in Earth’s past.The consequences reached far beyond the geology. This tectonic–oceanic upheaval likely interrupted one of the planet’s most important climate-regulating processes: the long-term burial of carbon in marine sediments. By disturbing these ancient, carbon-heavy layers, the event may have kept vast amounts of greenhouse gases circulating in the atmosphere, helping sustain the elevated global temperatures characteristic of the mid-Cretaceous, a period often referred to as one of Earth’s “greenhouse worlds.” Such persistent warmth not only influenced ocean chemistry and circulation but also shaped the evolution and distribution of marine life for millions of years afterward.Understanding precisely when the Equatorial Atlantic Gateway opened is therefore critical. It marks the moment the Atlantic transitioned from a series of isolated basins into a fully connected ocean, altering heat and nutrient flows on a global scale. By reconstructing this event, scientists can better model ancient ocean currents, climate feedback loops, and the deep-time mechanisms that still echo in today’s climate system. In essence, these mud waves are not just relics of a vanished seafloor, they are a geological signature of the forces that have shaped, and continue to shape, Earth’s climate trajectory.Why this discovery matters: from paleoceanography to climate modellingKnowing that the Atlantic began to take shape around 117 million years ago, evidence preserved in those colossal buried mud waves, significantly sharpens scientists’ ability to model ancient ocean behaviour, tectonic shifts, and climate feedback loops. This revised timeline offers a clearer window into how early ocean gateways controlled the movement of heat across the planet, regulated carbon sequestration in marine sediments, and set the stage for long-term cooling or warming trends.By tracing these deep-time processes, researchers can better understand the intricate relationship between ocean circulation and Earth’s climate system. Crucially, such knowledge is not confined to the past, it provides a framework for anticipating the effects of today’s oceanic changes. From accelerating polar ice melt to shifting global currents, the same mechanisms that once shaped the Cretaceous world could, in altered form, dictate the trajectory of our future climate.Also read| Study reveals nature's hardest teeth: Chitons inspire future material designAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Although there is still no specific therapeutic medicine, a vaccine has been developed and approved for use in certain parts of the world, but no licensed or approved dengue vaccines are available in India, a high-incidence country.Led by Sweden’s Karolinska Institute, the project involves researchers from eight European universities, five Indian institutions, a university from the US, and an NGO from Guatemala, all working in the field of public healthcare and medical research.The total project cost is estimated to be around Rs 90 crore. The EU has already sanctioned Euro 8 million (nearly Rs 81 crore). The balance will be funded by the Govt of India through the Dept of Biotechnology, Ujjwal Neogi, the coordinator for the project, also a senior lecturer at Karolinska Institute, told TOI.The EU partners are collaborating with several leading institutes in India that include Artemis Hospital and Max Hospital in New Delhi, Kasturba Medical College Hospital in Mangalore, Regional Centre for Biotechnology, Faridabad. The India part is being led by National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani in West Bengal. “We’re bringing together the brightest minds from Europe and India to understand the disease at a molecular level and design better tools for diagnosis and prevention,” Neogi from Karolinska Institute said.Stockholm-based Karolinska Institute is a 215-year-old world-leading medical research university that every year selects the Nobel Prize winner in physiology or medicine.The project has a dual objective. Primarily, it aims at better understanding the complete lifecycle of dengue infection: From the origin of the virus, to how it spreads in human beings to how it affects the human body. And then to come out with solutions so that the spread of this mosquito-induced disease could be contained, its impacts on human beings could be predicted during the early onset of the disease, and could be cured more effectively and quickly than now.With an estimated 100 million infections annually across 144 countries leading to over 10,000 deaths, this predominantly tropical disease is now spreading in Europe, mainly due to climate change, the project’s website noted.Another equally important objective of the project is to better understand how, in general, virus-induced pandemics spread and to prepare a blueprint for countering such incidents in future. The secondary objective of the project grew in importance in the backdrop of the Covid-induced global pandemic, researchers working in the project told TOI.From India’s side, the partners will make “original research contributions to the overall objectives of the program, that is pioneering innovative antiviral strategies to alleviate the burden of dengue infection while deepening our understanding of its complex pathogenesis through cutting-edge multi-modal technologies,” said Arindam Maitra, Professor, National Institute of Biomedical Genomics. Maitra is the chief coordinator for the researchers in India involved in this project.“The Indian team will collect, clinically characterize, undertake viral and host multiomics investigations to identify key factors facilitating severe disease and undertake research to come up with antiviral and immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies (that can regulate body's immune response) in collaboration with the EU team.” The ‘multiomics investigations’ here refer to an integrated data analysis of various DNA and RNA molecules within a dengue-infected person to identify novel biomarkers and improve disease classification.According to Neogi, among various cutting-edge research techniques, the project will use the brain-on-chip process. This is a relatively new research technique that simulates a human brain’s functions under a controlled environment in a laboratory. The researchers would be using the brain-on-chip process to see what happens to a human brain when the dengue virus infects the body. They expect the same technique could also give them some idea about combating the virus that is spread through mosquitoes. The technology will be transferred to India from the EU partners.About the primary takeaways for India from this project, Maitra said that given the increasing occurrence of severe disease and death following dengue virus infection in India and other parts of the globe, “this research initiative is expected to provide information and solutions which have the potential to play a major role in combating this challenge.”About the AuthorPartha SinhaPartha, senior assistant editor (markets) at The Times of India, Mumbai, covers the financial markets, mainly the stock market, mutual funds, banking and insurance sectors.

Entire villages have been wiped out, mass burials are underway, and hundreds remain missing as rescue efforts continue amidst warnings of more torrential rains. The scale of destruction is immense, with eyewitnesses recounting homes and vehicles swept away.  NEW DELHI: Entire villages have been wiped out and mass burials are taking place as flash floods wreak havoc across Pakistan, leaving at least 340 people dead and hundreds missing, news agency AFP reported. Officials and eyewitnesses described scenes of large-scale devastation, with homes, shops and vehicles swept away in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, the hardest-hit region.Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Prime Minister’s coordinator for KP affairs, Ikhtiar Wali Khan, warned the real toll could be far higher. “Entire villages have been wiped out. In Buner's Chagharzi area, massive destruction has taken place, while the village of Bashoni has completely disappeared from the map,” he told ARY News. Expressing fear that deaths in Dir alone could exceed 1,000, he added, “Mass burials are taking place. I have returned from Buner with a heavy heart after witnessing this disaster with my own eyes.”According to Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), torrential monsoon rains, flash floods, and landslides since June 26 have killed at least 657 people, including 171 children and 94 women, and injured 929. KP province alone has reported 390 deaths.PollShould international aid be prioritized for the flood victims in Pakistan?Yes, immediate aid is essentialNo, local resources should be utilized firstRescue workers continue to search for survivors, but officials admit hopes are fading. In Buner district, more than 150 people remain missing, with “10 to 12 entire villages” partially buried, according to local authorities. “The chances of those buried under the debris surviving are very slim,” said Bilal Ahmad Faizi of KP’s rescue agency.Eyewitnesses recalled the horror as floodwaters swept away everything in their path. “We saw all the houses, buildings, and vehicles being swept away like pieces of wood. When we looked down from the mountain, our home was gone,” said Suleman Khan, a schoolteacher who lost 25 relatives in Buner.Officials say the devastation is on par with past climate disasters in Pakistan. The government has declared several mountainous districts disaster-hit, while warnings of more torrential rains in the coming days raise fears of further destruction.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The deluge washed away roads, damaged homes, and disrupted train services on the Jammu-Pathankot line. Rescue operations are underway, with the Army, NDRF, and SDRF assisting victims.  NEW DELHI: A cloudburst in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kathua district has left at least seven people dead and several others injured, triggering landslides, flash floods and large-scale disruption. The incident, which occurred late Saturday night in Jodh Ghati village, washed away roads, damaged homes, and forced authorities into urgent rescue and relief operations.Train services along the vital Jammu-Pathankot line have also been suspended as rising water levels crossed danger marks on a key railway bridge. Helicopter evacuations have been launched, while multiple agencies including the Army, NDRF, SDRF and police are on the ground to restore connectivity and assist victims.Here are the top developments:Death toll rises to seven in KathuaOfficials confirmed that seven people have died in two separate incidents of cloudburst and landslide in Kathua. Five casualties occurred in Jodh Ghati following flash floods triggered by the overnight downpour, while two more died after a landslide in Janglote.Jammu Divisional Commissioner Ramesh Kumar said, “There was heavy rain in Kathua since last night... Seven people have died due to the landslide. Rescue operations are ongoing... Those who died due to the landslide, their bodies have been retrieved.” Rescue teams are still combing through debris and flood-hit areas amid fears of more missing persons. Helicopters were pressed into service due to washed-away roads and villages cut off from access.Train traffic disrupted on Jammu-Pathankot lineRail connectivity has been badly affected with the suspension of up-line train movement between Kathua and Budhi. Senior Divisional Commercial Manager, Jammu Railway Division, Uchit Singhal, said: “Due to heavy rains, water is flowing above the danger level through bridge number 43 between Kathua-Budhi. In view of this, temporarily till the water level subsides, up-line movement has been suspended, and in the meantime, up trains are being moved via a temporary single line through the down line track.” Villages cut off after flash floods and landslidesThe cloudburst snapped access to Jodh Ghati village, where floodwaters swept through homes and agricultural fields, leaving families stranded. Several connecting roads were washed away, and a bridge collapsed, worsening the situation. Deputy Commissioner Kathua Rajesh Sharma confirmed that rescue operations are underway and that stranded people are being shifted to safer areas. Local police reported that a station building in Kathua had also been damaged. Rescue operations led by Army and NDRFThe Indian Army, NDRF, SDRF, police and BRO have been deployed in full strength across Kathua. Heavy machinery has been brought in to fragment massive boulders that rolled down into residential areas. Inspector General of Police, Jammu Zone, Bhim Sen Tuti, said, “Boulders had fallen here which needed to be fragmented... Heavy machinery has been called for that. With the help of BRO, they are being fragmented here. These boulders are being removed by using explosives wherever needed, and bodies have been recovered from beneath them.”Helicopter evacuation for injured victimsUnion minister Jitendra Singh confirmed that helicopter services were arranged to shift injured people to nearby hospitals. In his social media post, Singh wrote, “Helicopter services have been arranged for shifting the injured to appropriate hospitals. 6 injured have been airlifted for hospitalisation in Mamoon, Pathankot, which was found to be relatively nearer destination.” DIG Police Shiv Kumar Sharma and his team are camping at the site and coordinating airlifts. Centre closely monitoring situation, says Amit ShahUnion home minister Amit Shah assured full support from the Central government. In a post on X, Shah wrote, “Spoke with the Lieutenant Governor and Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir regarding the cloudburst in Kathua. Relief and rescue operations are being carried out by the local administration, and NDRF teams have also been rushed to the site. Assured every support from the Modi government. We stand firmly behind our sisters and brothers of J&K.” LG Manoj Sinha calls tragedy 'mind-numbing'Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha expressed grief over the loss of lives. In his message on X, he wrote: “Deeply anguished by the loss of lives in the devastating rain-triggered landslides in several areas of Kathua. The tragedy is mind-numbing. Briefed Hon’ble Union Home Minister Sh. Amit Shah Ji on rescue and relief operations by the army, NDRF, SDRF, police & administration.” CM Omar Abdullah announces ex-gratia reliefChief minister Omar Abdullah conveyed condolences and directed immediate assistance for affected families. A statement from his office said Rs 2 lakh would be given for each deceased, Rs 1 lakh for severely injured, and Rs 50,000 for those with minor injuries. Compensation has also been announced for damaged homes: Rs 1 lakh for fully damaged houses, Rs 50,000 for severely damaged houses, and Rs 25,000 for partially damaged houses. “The Chief Minister has directed the administration to carry out immediate relief, rescue and evacuation measures to ensure the safety and support of affected families,” the statement said.Repeated cloudburst disasters in J&KThe Kathua disaster comes just three days after a cloudburst in Kishtwar’s Chisoti village killed 60 people and injured over 100. Experts warn that frequent extreme weather in J&K is linked to changing rainfall patterns and climate pressures in the Himalayan region. Officials say the back-to-back incidents highlight the need for stronger disaster preparedness and better drainage infrastructure. While the state government has sought central assistance, locals in Kathua have urged long-term flood protection measures. This includes improved embankments, real-time weather alerts, and a review of building norms in vulnerable areas.Connectivity and services slowly being restoredAuthorities are now focused on restoring essential services, including power, water and road links. In Kishtwar, where floods occurred earlier, officials said blasting of boulders was undertaken to clear blocked roads. Rope bridges are being built to reconnect cut-off villages in Kathua. “The power supply and water supply have been restored. A bridge is being built here with the help of the Army... All the passengers stranded in Machail were safely evacuated yesterday,” said Divisional Commissioner Ramesh Kumar.

The data for 2025 alone is a sign of things to come. A cruel summer as record wildfires scorch Europe Wildfires continue to burn across the south of Europe amid record-breaking summer heatwaves in many fire-prone regions. In some places, these fires have been exacerbated by wet spring months, which have helped vegetation growth capable of catching alight with ease during a dry summer.Already, an area equivalent to 1.5 times the size of Luxembourg — roughly 438,568 hectares — has burned across Europe in 2025. That figure is almost three times the size of fire damaged caused up to the same point in 2024.It comes as some parts of southern Europe suffer through multiple 40-degree (104 Fahrenheit) days, and prolonged heatwaves lasting a fortnight.The current summer has been described as the worst for wildfires in two decades.Where are the fires burning? What is the situation right now?"We're seeing extreme temperatures in large parts of Europe, records being broken of 40 degrees in many places," said Julie Berckmans, a climate scientist at the European Environmental Agency."Southern France, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Belgium, Netherlands, UK, are all hitting high temperatures [and] massive wildfires in Spain, Portugal, France, Greece, Turkey, Albania."In Spain, those fires have burned through an area the size of London already.Portugal is fighting its own fires, with around four thousand firefighters currently active across seven active sites. It has also been forced to request help from the European Union's firefighting forces.An even greater number of firefighters has been mobilized in Greece, which is battling 20 blazes during this peak fire season.Deaths have occurred in Spain, Portugal, Montenegro and Italy from fires and heat-related events this summer.It has been a severe fire seasonEurope uses data from its Copernicus satellite fleet to monitor fire activity, and collates the data via the European Forest Fires Information System (EFFIS).A substantial amount of fire damage in 2025 has already occured.More than 250,000 hectares more of land has burnt than the same time in 2024.There have more than 1,600 fires across Europe, compared to just under 1,100 last year.And new regions are also experiencing greater than usual fire activity.Spain, for instance, has seen twice as much of its territory burned-through compared to the 2006-2024 average. Romania has lost four times as much land to fires this year.Cyprus has been badly impacted. It could usually expect to see around 0.32% of its landmass burned each year. Already in 2025 it's 2.5% — nearly eight times more.But it's also the number of fires that is concerning. France has had nearly three times as many fires as average amid what has been the worst wildfire season for its southern regions in decades.More to come...The fallout of severe wildfires goes beyond land loss or human fatalities. Damage to ecosystems through vegetation loss, health impacts through smoke inhalation, and economic decline are all consequences of widespread fire events."It's about €2.5 billion [$2.9 billion] of damage lost every year in the EU," Berckmans told DW. "45,000 people on average were displaced due to wildfires from 2008 to 2023."The European Environment Agency's first climate risk assessment, published in 2024, found that urgent action is required to address the critical risk wildfires will pose to populations and infastructure and biodiversity in southern Europe."Wildfires are an urgent risk to address," said Berckmans. "It's also a major risk that needs more action now in the rest of Europe."As European fall approaches, the number of fires and the damage they cause should slow. However forecasting the length of fire danger season, and the behavior of fires themselves, is becoming more difficult.Climate change will not only generate warmer and drier conditions across southern Europe, it will also begin to change other dynamic factors.Faster and more volatile wind systems, for instance, will increase the challenge for fire management personnel to predict how blazes will behave. That puts the lives of emergency workers and civilians at greater risk."Picture a fire so fierce, so fast, and so unpredictable it seems alive, capable of reshaping the weather around it and leaping across kilometers in a heartbeat," said Antonio Lopez, an expert in wildfires at the University of Seville, Spain.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousNew blood pressure guideline by American Heart Association: Key takeawaysLifestyle‘Coolie’ star Shruti Haasan turns heads with her stunning style momentseEntertainmentAishwarya Khare’s off-screen chic lookstvIn pic: Radiant pictures of Shruti HaasanEntertainmentIn pics: Preity Mukhundhan’s stylish wardrobe collectionEntertainmentPallavi Gowda’s top 10 traditional lookstvSai Pallavi’s ethereal charmEntertainmentFatty liver disease: Warning signs one should not ignoreLifestyleJanhvi Kapoor’s mesmerising saree game is giving sleepless nights to other actresses!LifestyleA look at Sidharth Malhotra's dapper fashion momentsEntertainment Next123 Photostories  5 hints your friendship is costing your mental healthAkshay Kumar to Sourabh Raaj Jain : Actors who played Lord Krishna on screenWeird things snakes eat: From eggs to… themselves?

India is ahead in clean energy commitments, achieves 2030 goal five years early In what could be considered as a landmark moment for India's clean energy journey, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, from the ramparts of the Red Fort, on Friday announced that the nation has achieved its 50 per cent clean energy target in 2025 -- a full five years ahead of the 2030 deadline.Marking Independence Day celebrations, the Prime Minister announced and hailed the achievement as a pivotal step towards an Atmanirbhar Bharat in the energy sector, underscoring the country's transformation from a fossil-fuel-dependent importer to a global clean energy leader."When the world today expresses concern over global warming, I wish to tell the world that Bharat has resolved to achieve 50 per cent clean energy by 2030. That was our target for 2030. Look at the capability of my countrymen, look at their determination to fulfil the resolve of making Bharat developed--we achieved the 50 per cent clean energy target in 2025 itself, five years ahead of schedule. This is because we are as sensitive towards the world as we are responsible towards nature," PM Modi said on the occasion of 79th Independence.At COP26 held in 2021, India committed to an ambitious five-part "Panchamrit" pledge.This included reaching 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity, generating half of all energy requirements from renewables, and reducing emissions by 1 billion tonnes by 2030. India also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent and achieve net-zero emissions by 2070.According to the latest government data, India added a record 29.52 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity in 2024-25, taking total installed renewable energy (RE) capacity to 234.24 GW (excluding nuclear), up from 198.75 GW last year.Solar energy leads the charge, with installed capacity skyrocketing from just 2.82 GW in 2014 to 116.24 GW today, now accounting for nearly half of India's total RE capacity.Wind power follows at 51.67 GW, while large and small hydro contribute 54.72 GW combined. Biopower has also grown to 11.59 GW over the past decade.India now ranks 4th globally in total RE capacity, 3rd in solar power, and 4th in wind energy, boasting the world's fastest-growing renewable program.The clean energy surge has been powered by a suite of ambitious government reforms and programs.The PM-Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana, with a Rs 75,021 crore outlay, aims to provide free solar electricity to one crore households.As of August 14, 2025, over 17.24 lakh households have benefitted, with subsidies worth Rs 9,841.77 crore released. The scheme also introduced Model Solar Villages to promote decentralised clean power at the grassroots level.In agriculture, the PM-KUSUM scheme has installed over 8.53 lakh solar pumps, replacing diesel-powered systems and cutting an estimated 6.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.Beyond solar, India is expanding in wind, hydro, bioenergy, green hydrogen, and nuclear power. Offshore wind projects, backed by a Rs 7,453 crore viability gap funding scheme, are set to add 1 GW capacity off Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.The National Green Hydrogen Mission, with a Rs 19,744 crore budget, targets 5 million metric tonnes (MMT) annual production by 2030, along with 125 GW of new RE, Rs 8 lakh crore in investments, and 6 lakh jobs. Hydrogen hubs have been identified in Kandla, Paradip, and Tuticorin.In the nuclear sector, operational capacity has grown from 4,780 MW in 2014 to 8,780 MW across 25 reactors, with a remarkable 87 per cent plant load factor in 2024-25. Ten new reactors are already functional, and capacity is set to increase tenfold by 2047."The result is a virtuous cycle: local manufacturing creates jobs and resilience, competitive tariffs make clean energy affordable, and inclusive programs bring every citizen into the transition. As we look ahead to 2030 and beyond, India is not just meeting global commitments -- it is setting a new template for how a nation can grow, decarbonise, and remain self-reliant. In the journey from energy dependence to energy leadership, the momentum is unmistakable, and the destination is clear: an Atmanirbhar Bharat, powered by its own clean, green energy," the government said today, in a factsheet.With five years gained on its clean energy target, India is now firmly on track to meet, and potentially exceed, its 500 GW non-fossil capacity goal by 2030, positioning itself as a decisive force in the global fight against climate change.

But time is running out fast," he added. Representative image LONDON: A multi-million pound conservation programme in England helped save 150 struggling species but "time is running out" to halt the decline, the head of Natural England, which led the initiative, said Wednesday.The public body, responsible for protecting and enhancing England's natural environment, invested a £13 million ($17.6 million) grant in efforts to support animal and plant species such as water vole, oystercatcher, lady's slipper orchid, the hazel dormouse and Atlantic salmon. "From the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall to Cumbria and Northumberland, 63 different projects involving 78 partners have transformed landscapes and supported the recovery of 150 species, many of which were on the brink of national extinction, through research, captive breeding, habitat creation, and conservation translocations," the body said in a statement released Wednesday.More than 15,000 individual animals and plants were translocated to expand species territories under the projects, which ran from August 2023 to March 2025. Notable successes include the reintroduction of black grouse to the North Yorkshire Moors, northern England, and the return of the large marsh grasshopper to the Norfolk Broads in east England after an 85-year absence. Despite the achievements, the chair of Natural England Tony Juniper warned more needed to be done. "A rising number of nature recovery projects, both large and small, are making a huge difference up and down the country," he said in the press release."We know we can turn round species decline and improve ecosystems with the right targeted actions, the drive and the funding. But time is running out fast," he added.Juniper called for more projects, more volunteers and more investment, particularly from the private sector.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous10 creatures that can live inside volcanic zonesLifestyleYou’re probably a hater if you’re one of these zodiac signsastrologyHow to set up a planted aquarium at home and the types of fish to keep: 10-step guideLifestyle'Coolie': Rajinikanth to SoubinShahir'spay revealed!EntertainmentAlia Bhatt’s hairstylist warns against straightening damp hair: Know why we agree with himLifestyleZodiac signs who are known for their simplicityastrologyDO NOT ignore these warning signs of a heart attackLifestyleDipika Kakar’s top 10 gorgeous ethnic looks for festive seasontvJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than Wordstv Next123 Photostories  Janmashtami 2025: 5 savoury snacks perfect for fasting and feasting5 veggies to pair with Rajma (kidney beans) to boost its fiber contentThese foods can reduce the cooking time of meat5 last-minute weekend trips from Delhi you can plan right now!From Varsha to Divinesh: A look at the winners of Sa Re Ga Ma Pa TamilIndependence Day: Unveiling 10 rare pictures from India’s struggle for freedom7 foods to strictly avoid in monsoon seasonGuard deployed, protests erupt: National Guard steps up presence in Washington; 10 things to knowMovies that made us question everything we thought we knewSara Tendulkar’s protein drinks: How to make them and their benefits123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillVanessa BryantDwyane WadeKyrie lrvingNHL Trade RumorsRaj KundraWhy Roblox Get Banned in QatarMega Slowbro solo in Pokemon GOJohnny SomalisBrock Lesnar Net WorthTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteAir Arabia reports AED 415 million net profit in Q2 2025 despite regional disruptionsUAE heatwave alert: Temperatures to soar to 46°C in Dubai and Abu DhabiUAE: Etihad hits record 20.3 million passengers in 12 months for the first timeUkraine-Russia conflict: Zelenskyy arrives in London, meets UK PM Starmer ahead of Trump-Putin's Alaska summitWhat is David G.

In China, coastal provinces evacuated around 15,000 residents as the storm moved towards the Taiwan Strait, impacting flights and regions south of Taipei.  KAOHSIUNG: Thousands of people sheltered and fishermen secured their boats across storm-battered southern Taiwan on Wednesday as Typhoon Podul intensified on its approach to the island.The typhoon is packing wind speeds of 155 kilometres (96 miles) per hour at its centre and "is strengthening", Central Weather Administration (CWA) forecaster Lin Ting-yi told AFP.Podul is on track to hit lightly populated Taitung County at around noon (0400 GMT) before sweeping across the island and into the Taiwan Strait."We are worried about this typhoon," Kaohsiung fisherman Huang Wei told AFP as he used more ropes to tie down his boat and checked on other vessels."We had already made general typhoon preparations yesterday, but this morning I woke up and saw news reports that the typhoon has intensified to be as strong as the last, (Typhoon) Krathon," Huang said."Last time, the two boats behind us weren't tied properly and hit my boat."Krathon slammed into Kaohsiung in October, with wind gusts of 162kph. Podul has gusts of 191kph, Lin said. More than 5,500 people have been evacuated from their homes ahead of Podul, disaster officials said Wednesday, as the typhoon threatens to pound central and southern regions that are still recovering from storms last month.Mountainous areas of Kaohsiung City and neighbouring Pingtung County, as well as Hualien and Taitung counties, could see torrential rain, the CWA said.All domestic flights across the island of 23 million people have been cancelled, along with dozens of international journeys.Many ferry services have been suspended and businesses and schools across the south closed.Typhoon Danas, which hit Taiwan in early July, killed two people and injured hundreds as the storm dumped more than 500mm (about 20 inches) of rain across the south over a weekend.That was followed by torrential rain from July 28 to August 4, with some areas recording more than Taiwan's rainfall of 2.1 metres for 2024.The week of bad weather left five people dead, three missing, and 78 injured, a disaster official said previously.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 expensive animal-shaped bags that’ll leave you almost shocked!Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?Maharashtra’s UNESCO World Heritage Sites and other iconic monuments for history loversRajinikanth completes 50 years in cinema: Lesser-known facts about the ‘Coolie’ star6 lizards that prove reptiles can be adorable123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

Momentum sagging at UN plastic pollution treaty talks
Talks on forging a landmark treaty to combat the scourge of plastic pollution were stumbling Saturday, with progress slow and countries wildly at odds on how far the proposed agreement should go. The talks are mandated to look at the full life cycle of plastic, from production to pollution, but some countries are unhappy with such a wide scope.

Representative image GENEVA: Talks on forging a landmark treaty to combat the scourge of plastic pollution were stumbling Saturday, with progress slow and countries wildly at odds on how far the proposed agreement should go.The negotiations, which opened on Tuesday, have four working days left to strike a legally-binding instrument that would tackle the growing problem choking the environment.In a blunt mid-way assessment, talks chair Luis Vayas Valdivieso warned the 184 countries negotiating at the United Nations that they had to get shifting to get a deal."Progress made has not been sufficient," Vayas told delegates."A real push to achieve our common goal is needed," the Ecuadoran diplomat said, adding that Thursday was not a just deadline but "a date by which we must deliver."Some articles still have unresolved issues and show little progress towards reaching a common understanding," Vayas lamented.The key fracture is between countries that want to focus on waste management and others who want a more ambitious treaty that also cuts production and eliminates use of the most toxic chemicals.And with the talks relying on finding consensus, it has become a game of brinkmanship.A diplomatic source told reporters that many informal meetings had been scrambled together for Sunday's day off to try and break the deadlock."If nothing changes, we won't get there," the source added.Battle of the bracketsCountries have reconvened in Geneva after the failure of the supposedly fifth and final round of negotiations in Busan, South Korea in 2024.After four days of talks, the draft text has ballooned from 22 to 35 pages -- with the number of brackets in the text going up near five-fold to almost 1,500 as countries insert a blizzard of conflicting wishes and ideas.The talks are mandated to look at the full life cycle of plastic, from production to pollution, but some countries are unhappy with such a wide scope.Kuwait spoke up for the so-called Like-Minded Group -- a nebulous cluster of mostly oil-producing nations which rejects production limits and wants to focus on treating waste."Let us agree on what we can agree. Consensus must be the basis of all our decisions," Kuwait insisted.Nudging in the same direction, Saudi Arabia, speaking for the Arab Group, said the responsible way ahead was to start considering what bits of the text "may not make it to the final outcome due to irreconcilable divergence".But given how little is truly agreed on, Uruguay warned that consensus "cannot be used as a justification to not achieve our objectives".Eirik Lindebjerg, global plastics adviser for the World Wide Fund for Nature, told AFP that the Like-Minded Group's proposal was "another attempt to make it a waste management agreement", and to stifle talks on reducing the amount of plastic in circulation.Path through the fogThe UN Environment Programme is hosting the talks and swiftly called a press conference after the stock-take session.UNEP executive director Inger Andersen said a deal was "really within our grasp, even though today it might not look so"."Despite the fog of negotiations I'm really encouraged," she told reporters, insisting: "There is a pathway to success."Vayas added: "We need to accelerate. We need a better rhythm in this and we need to also work in such a way that it will be clear that we will deliver by the end."Afterwards, Bjorn Beeler, executive director at IPEN, a global network aimed at limiting toxic chemicals, told AFP: "This whole process has not been able to take decisions and is still collecting ideas. We're sleepwalking towards a cliff and if we don't wake up, we're falling off."'Profits from poisoning'Plastic pollution is so ubiquitous that microplastics have been found on the highest mountain peaks, in the deepest ocean trench and scattered throughout almost every part of the human body.More than 400 million tonnes of plastic are produced globally each year, half of which is for single-use items.Plastic production is set to triple by 2060.Panama's negotiator Juan Monterrey Gomez took the floor to slam those countries wanting to stop the treaty from encompassing the entire life cycle of plastic.He said microplastics "are in our blood, in our lungs and in the first cry of a new-born child. Our bodies are living proof of a system that profits from poisoning us". "We cannot recycle our way out of this crisis."End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksGlobal Standard indexUS stocks todayIndia-US tariffIntel CEOMukesh AmbaniUS jobless dataRussia crude oilTop TrendingTyreek HillSelena GomezKim KardashianTaylor SwiftTravis KelceBill Belichicks GirlfriendNBA Trade RumorsDwyane WadesShannon SharpeMike VrabelTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteTyreek Hill, ex Keeta Vaccaro rush baby Capri to ER;

Climate heat extremes driving tropical bird decline: study
Tropical bird populations have plummeted not only due to deforestation but also extreme heat attributable to climate change, according to a study published on Monday in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.  Another study published in 2017 showed how some tropical hummingbirds are now forced to seek shade to regulate their temperature in extreme heat, cutting into the amount of time they can spend searching for life-sustaining nectar.

Another study published in 2017 showed how some tropical hummingbirds are now forced to seek shade to regulate their temperature in extreme heat, cutting into the amount of time they can spend searching for life-sustaining nectar.  Representative image PARIS: Tropical bird populations have plummeted not only due to deforestation but also extreme heat attributable to climate change, according to a study published on Monday in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. Intensifying temepratures caused a 25-38 percent reduction in tropical bird populations between 1950 and 2020, compared to a scenario without manmade global warming, scientists based in Europe and Australia reported. "The findings are pretty stark," lead author Maximilian Kotz, a researcher at the National Supercomputing Centre in Barcelona and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), told AFP.Bird populations in the tropics now face 30 days of heat extremes per year compared to three per year in the mid-20th century, he noted. "This has major consequences for how we think about biodiversity conservation," Kotz said by email. "Protecting pristine habitats is crucial, but without dealing with climate change it won't be enough for birds."Nearly half of all bird species are found in biodiversity-rich tropical regions. These often colourful animals perform essential services for ecosystems, such as dispersing plant seeds. Invasive species another threatBut birds living in these regions may already be "close to the limits" of their tolerance to high temperatures, which can cause heatstroke (hyperthermia) or dehydration. The overview study does not provide figures for individual species, but earlier literature is rich with examples of the devastating impact of rising temperatures.One documented the heat-related decline of birds in Panama, including the king quetzal, the red-crested quetzal, the two-coloured kingfisher and the aurora trogon. Another study published in 2017 showed how some tropical hummingbirds are now forced to seek shade to regulate their temperature in extreme heat, cutting into the amount of time they can spend searching for life-sustaining nectar. Extreme heat waves, which are becoming more frequent, represent a far greater threat than increases in average temperatures or rainfall, another result of human-induced climate change. Up to now, it has been assumed that the decline in bird populations worldwide was due mainly to other well-identified factors, especially habitat loss, pesticide use, hunting, and invasive species, especially snakes that snack on bird eggs and mosquitos carrying avian malaria. But the new findings "challenge the view that direct human pressures have so far been the dominant driver of impacts on bird populations compared to climate change in tropical regions," according to the authors. To reach this conclusion, they analysed observational data from more than 3,000 bird populations around the world and used statistical modelling to isolate the effects of extreme weather from other factors.The findings help complete the picture of tropical bird decline, noted Aimee Van Tatenhove, a post-doctoral fellow at Cornell University's Center for Avian Population Studies who was not involved in the study."Deforestation has an obvious impact -- trees are cut and habitat is destroyed," she told AFP. "We need long-term datasets like the authors used to understand how extreme temperatures impact avian populations.""This study is an important reminder that we need to continue examining different causes of population declines and apply those findings to conservation initiatives," she continued.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  From Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leavesTop 5 Getaways in North and South India to Work RemotelyFrom Cristiano Ronaldo’s million-dollar sparkler to Arjun Tendulkar’s intimate proposal: Celebrity engagements that created buzz in 2025Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 expensive animal-shaped bags that’ll leave you almost shocked!Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

Silopi, a city in the Sirnak province, is located around 10 kilometres from the Iraq and Syrian borders. It shattered the previous national high of 49.5 C recorded in August 2023 in the western province of Eskisehir. Turkey has faced weeks of scorching heat along with several wildfires. Fourteen people lost their lives battling blazes last month in the western part of the country. Hundreds of people were evacuated on Friday in the northwest province of Canakkale, where the busy Dardanelles Strait was closed to maritime traffic due to two raging fires. The heatwave has also prompted fears of water shortages in some areas. The resort town of Cesme on the Aegean Sea has restricted tap water for residents and tourists between 11:00 pm to 6:00 am since July 25.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksGlobal Standard indexUS stocks todayIndia-US tariffIntel CEOMukesh AmbaniUS jobless dataRussia crude oilTop TrendingTyreek HillSelena GomezKim KardashianTaylor SwiftTravis KelceBill Belichicks GirlfriendNBA Trade RumorsDwyane WadesShannon SharpeMike VrabelTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteTyreek Hill, ex Keeta Vaccaro rush baby Capri to ER;

Representative image (Image: AP) LAGRASSE: A wildfire in southern France slowed overnight into Wednesday after injuring nine people and burning through 11,000 hectares of vegetation, local officials said. The blaze, which started on Tuesday afternoon, is still threatening several villages in the aude department, where 1,500 firefighters have been battling to extinguish it."The fire is advancing in an area where all the conditions are ripe for it to progress. We are monitoring the edges and the back of the fire to prevent flare-ups," said Lucie Roesch, secretary general of the qude prefecture.She said firefighters are expecting to receive aerial support at dawn, but warned "this fire will keep us busy for several days. It's a long-term operation".The fire's advance slowed overnight due to high humidity levels, she added.One person was seriously burned and another injured, the prefecture said, adding that seven firefighters were also hurt. Camping grounds and one village were partially evacuated, and several local roads have been closed."All of the Nation's resources are mobilised," French president Emmanuel Macron said on X, while calling on people to exercise "the utmost caution".The qude department has seen an increase in areas burnt in recent years, aggravated by low rainfall and the removal of vineyards, which used to help break the progression of fires.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle10 baby names that mean creativity and visionLifestyleWhen looks can be deceptive: 10 ‘PRETTY’ killers in the animal worldLifestyleBirthday Special: Spine-chilling quotes of Alfred Hitchcock that will keep you up at nightLifestyleSet up a mini lotus pond at home with these easy tipsLifestyleAttractive looks of Srithika Saneeshtv10 creatures that can walk on waterLifestyleSheet masks out, Kareena Kapoor Khan’s DIY napkin mask inLifestyleBhagyashri Borse charms with her gorgeous outfitsEntertainmentMost affordable diesel cars under Rs 12 lakh: Kia Syros, Mahindra Thar and moreauto Next123 Photostories  6 lizards that prove reptiles can be adorableHow to unrot your brain: 5 effective steps to sharpen focus and boost mental clarityFrom Mullum Malarum to Kabali: Rajinikanth’s most emotional movies that fans still cherishLegends reborn – Bollywood actors who came back strongKyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi 2: Smriti Irani, Amar Upadhyay and other stars' educational qualificationGreen, pink and purple — jaw-dropping Northern Lights photos you won’t believe are realFrom Munshi Ranjeet to David John: Bigg Boss Malayalam contestants who faced first-week evictionAdorable baby shower photos of Bigg Boss Telugu fame Soniya'RRR,' 'Kaalapani,' and 'Major': South Indian films that celebrate IndiaNayanthara's classic films to watch123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillJessica RadcliffeLebron JamesBasanti ChatterjeePatrick MahomesGautam AdaniElon MuskIndia Nayara EnergyCJI GavaiBengaluru Student AttackTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteImmigration crackdown: Venezuelan civic groups sue Trump admin over termination of Temporary Protected Status; call it cruelty towards vulnerableFormer Platters band member Sandra Hall goes missing, last seen on Friday in Brooklyn; search under wayUAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed sends firefighting team to aid Albania’s wildfire battleRoad safety improves sharply in Kuwait: Accidents down 45%, deaths down 34% in first half of 2025Kuwait: No more minimum salary requirement for family visit visas, what expats need to knowTurkish Airlines and Oman Air frequent flyer partnership: Travelers can now earn miles across both airlines‘Take our capital back’: Nearly 800 troops deployed by Donald Trump arrive at DC; 23 individuals arrested overnightBahrain stands tall: Ranks 3rd in Arab region in new UN Human Development reportUAE: What is Abu Dhabi's ‘Hayat’ program?

AI image ALGIERS: At a beach near Algiers, brown algae native to the Pacific Ocean cover the golden sand, posing a threat to ecosystems native to the area and their stench repelling swimmers at the peak of summer.Following a recent government call to help clear beaches swarmed by the seaweed species known scientifically as Rugulopteryx okamurae, several volunteers and charities have stepped in."When it washes up, we can't swim," said Salim Hemmedi, a 43-year-old vacationer at a beach in Sidi Fredj, where volunteers raked up heaps of the plant."We hope the situation will improve so that we can enjoy ourselves... and that children can swim in peace."The alga originates from temperate waters around Japan and the Korean peninsula in the northwest Pacific Ocean.It was first spotted in Algeria in late 2023, according to Lamia Bahbah, a lecturer and researcher at the National School of Marine Sciences and Coastal Planning.And lately, some have noted that it has been increasingly washed ashore.Youcef Segni, a marine engineer and biologist, said the algae proliferated at a significantly higher rate than in 2023 and 2024."They invade the habitats of other algae in the seabed, which leads to the disappearance of some species," he said, adding that it can also displace some native fish.Fast reproductionIn France, Spain and Portugal, the Rugulopteryx okamurae species has also been observed.Earlier this year, Spanish football club Real Betis introduced kits repurposed from seaweed to raise awareness about the issue.A 2023 study by the Marine Drugs journal said the alga's invasive character led to "a replacement of the native biota and an occupancy rate that reached almost 100 per cent in some locations" in Portugal.In Algeria, the plant has been spotted in at least three of the country's 14 coastal provinces, including the capital where 16 beaches are affected, authorities said."Are the waters suitable for swimming? Yes," said Environment Minister Nadjiba Djilali during the cleanup campaign, adding there were no records of the plant causing allergies.Researcher Bahbah said stopping its proliferation was "unfortunately impossible at this stage".She said the plant reproduces at a high rate, both sexually and asexually.The species can reproduce through fragmentation, meaning new individual algae can develop from fragmented pieces of other Rugulopteryx okamurae algae.The algae spread mainly by clinging to the hulls of boats, and the Mediterranean's moderate temperature favours the seaweed's fast reproduction."We are going to fight it," said Fella Zaboudj, a state engineer in marine sciences, adding that researchers were monitoring its spread, development and evolution.Zaboudj said research was also underway to determine whether the algae could be repurposed as fertiliser.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksSibu SorenPatna Double Decker BridgeSpiceJetRBI MPC MeetRussia OilUS China TradeNSDL IPO allotmentTop TrendingTrinity RodmanDe'Aaron FoxConnor BedardDennis RodmanRussell WilsonMitch MarnersKirby DachMatthew TkachukConnor McDavidAdam RuzickaTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website'Will raise tariff substantially in 24 hours': Donald Trump fires fresh salvo;

Ireland's wind energy sector has long been touted as full of potential. AI image BANGOR: On Ireland's blustery western seaboard, researchers are gleefully flying giant kites, not for fun but in the hope of generating renewable electricity and sparking a "revolution" in wind energy."We use a kite to capture the wind and a generator at the bottom of it that captures the power," Padraic Doherty of Kitepower, the Dutch firm behind the venture, told AFP. At its test site in operation since September 2023 near the small town of Bangor Erris, the team transports the vast 60-square-metre (645,000-square-feet) kite from a hangar across the lunar-like bogland to a generator. The kite is then attached by a cable tether to the machine and acts like a "yo-yo or fishing reel", Doherty said."It gets cast out and flies up, the tether pulls it back in, over and over again, creating energy," he said, testing the kite's ropes and pulleys before a flight.The sparsely populated spot near the stormy Atlantic coast is the world's first designated airborne renewable energy test site. And although the idea is still small in scale, it could yet prove to be a mighty plan as Ireland seeks to cut its reliance on fossil fuels such as oil and gas."We are witnessing a revolution in wind energy," said Andrei Luca, operations head at Kitepower, a zero-emissions energy solutions spin-off from the Delft University of Technology."It took nearly 25 years for wind turbines to evolve from 30-kilowatt prototypes to megawatt scale, and decades to offshore wind farms we see today," he added.The system flies autonomously, driven by software developed at the university in the Netherlands, but Doherty acts as the kite's "pilot" on the ground, monitoring its flight path for efficiency. The kite flies up around 400 metres (1,300 feet) and reels in to about 190 metres, generating around 30 kilowatts for storage.The force spins "like a dynamo on a bike", Doherty said, adding that "it generates up to two and a half tonnes of force through each turn".The electricity is stored in batteries, similar to solar photovoltaic systems, with the kite currently able to fully charge a 336-kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery."That's a meaningful amount of energy, sufficient for powering a remote outpost, a small island, polar station, or even a construction site," Luca said."Add additional kites and we can power a bigger island."'Mobile, flexible'According to Doherty, a chief advantage of the kite system is its flexibility and swift start-up capability."We can set up in 24 hours and can bring it anywhere, it's super mobile, and doesn't need expensive, time- and energy-consuming turbine foundations to be built," he said. A kite system is "way less invasive on the landscape (than wind turbines), produces clean energy and doesn't need a supply chain of fuel to keep running", Luca added.During January's Storm Eowyn, which caused widespread and long-lasting power outages in Ireland, the system showed its value in Bangor Erris, according to Luca. "Paired with a battery, it provided uninterrupted electricity before, during and after the storm," he said. Ireland's wind energy sector has long been touted as full of potential.But progress on large-scale delivery of onshore and offshore turbines has been held up by planning delays and electricity grid capacity constraints.The Irish government has set ambitious targets for offshore wind energy to deliver 20 gigawatts of energy by 2040 and at least 37 gigawatts by 2050.In 2024, Irish wind farms provided around a third of the country's electricity according to Wind Energy Ireland (WEI), a lobby group for the sector. This compares to the UK, where, according to trade association RenewableUK, wind energy from the country's combined wind farms first reached 20 gigawatts in November 2022.The ability of airborne wind energy (AWE) systems to harness high-altitude winds with relatively low infrastructure requirements "makes them particularly suitable for remote, offshore or mobile applications," Mahdi Salari, an AWE researcher at University College Cork, told AFP.But he said Kitepower would face challenges on "regulation, safety, and system reliability". Such technology however could plug gaps in places where "land availability, costs or logistical constraints hinder the deployment of traditional wind turbines", Salari said.By the 2030s, he said: "I expect AWE to contribute meaningfully to diversified, flexible and distributed renewable energy networks".Discover stories of India’s leading eco-innovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksSibu SorenPatna Double Decker BridgeSpiceJetGold Price PredectionRussia OilUS China TradeNSDL IPO allotmentTop TrendingRussell WilsonHailee SteinfeldsF1 StandingsDez BryantLebron James WifeRussia Oil ImportsTriple HPrince HarryRJ MahvashAntonio BrownTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteBrooke Hogan’s husband: Hulk Hogan showed no interest in meeting grandkidsDak Prescott builds new mansion, reveals why he razed the last oneTaylor Swift’s Kelce jacket inspires Kristin Juszczyk’s new NFL lineGabrielle Union on menopause: 'It makes it hard' — motherhood now more emotional, exhaustingGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai to employees: ‘I think we have to....'Apple CEO Tim Cook confirms: Majority of new iPhones sold in the US are 'made' in India;

The zoo assures that donated animals like rabbits and guinea pigs will be humanely euthanized before being used as food.

This initiative aims to mimic the natural food chain, promoting animal welfare and natural behaviour among captive carnivores. (Ai generated image)  If you have a pet you can no longer keep, one zoo in Denmark is offering an unusual option.Aalborg Zoo is asking the public to donate small pets — not for rehoming, but to be used as food for its captive predators.Aalborg Zoo, located in northern Denmark, said in a Facebook post that the move is meant to mimic the natural food chain of animals housed there. The zoo says this effort supports “animal welfare and professional integrity,” and assures that any donated pets will be “gently euthanized” by trained staff.“If you have a healthy animal that needs to be given away for various reasons, feel free to donate it to us,” the post said.The zoo lists rabbits, guinea pigs, horses and chickens as examples of suitable donations.PollWhat do you think about Aalborg Zoo's practice of accepting pets for food for predators?Support it for animal welfareOppose it, find other solutionsOnce euthanised, the animals will be used as fodder for the zoo’s carnivores.“That way, nothing goes to waste — and we ensure natural behaviour, nutrition and well-being of our predators,” the zoo claimed.The post is accompanied by a picture of a wildcat showing its teeth with its mouth wide open. It also includes a link to the zoo’s website.About the zoo Aalborg Zoo was founded in April 1935. The facility is located near the centre of Aalborg and spans 8 hectares. It houses more than 1,500 animals across 126 species and draws hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.According to the zoo’s official website, Aalborg Zoo focuses on conservation, sustainability and education.It takes part in international breeding programmes for endangered species and supports global efforts in animal conservation, research and fair trade. It was also the first zoo in Denmark to receive an environment certificate and is known for its work in protecting nature and the environment.The zoo maintains that the practice of using donated pets as prey aligns with its mission to support natural behaviours in captive predators.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

LISBON: Portugal's government on Saturday issued an alert warning of a heatwave with a high risk of fires in large parts of the country in the coming days.The alert, covering Sunday to Thursday, included a ban on bonfires, fireworks and the use of electrical equipment in forests.The authorities also restricted access to some woodland areas, announced a boost in staffing for the forest ranger service and increased land and air patrols in high fire-risk areas."The next week will be difficult" said Home Affairs Minister Maria Lucia Amaral.Both Portugal and neighbouring Spain have had to battle wildfires in the recent days, a problem they and other countries face every year.Experts say climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of droughts and fires around the world.Following the deadly fire season in 2017, Portugal ramped up its spending on wildfire prevention and response. More than 29,000 hectares (71,600 acres) have already been destroyed by fire since the beginning of the year, according to Portugal's Institute of Forests (ICNF).End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous'Kingom' actor Vijay Deverakonda’s stylish looksEntertainmentVijay Deverakonda’s fitness workout routineEntertainmentTop 10 colour-changing birds of IndiaLifestyleRaksha Bandhan-worthy mehendi designs to try this yearLifestyle10 things to know before getting an Arowana fish for good luckLifestyleMouni Roy’s top 10 gorgeous ethnic lookstvPriya Prakash Varrier serves fierce fashionEntertainmentSouth Actresses dazzle in this week's best photosEntertainmentMost popular baby names of 2024Lifestyle9 Ayurvedic habits to regulate the nervous systemLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Bigg Boss Malayalam 7 contestants Adhila and Noora: All about the lesbian couple who fought a legal battle for loveWhen fame faded Mahima Chaudhry chose to fight not fall5 snake parks in India that are absolutely fang-tastic and what makes them special5 things to know before drinking water in a copper bottleBigg Boss Malayalam 7 contestant Rena Fathima: Who is this 19-year-old influencer?From ‘DDLJ’ to ‘Saiyaara’: 5 Bollywood love stories that gave us hopeful, happy endingsHollywood's 7 BFFs whose friendship stood the test of timeThe Great Indian Kapil Show: From a luxurious house in Madh Island worth approximately Rs 12 crore to net worth, car collection; Archana Puran Singh’s lavish life'Coolie' audio launch highlights: Star-studded speeches, roaring cheers & a grand tribute to Rajinikanth—everything you should not missFrom Thummanpeta to Stardom:Meet the family behind Vijay Deverakonda’s stardom123Hot PicksKamala HarrisIndian NavyJ&K landslideTrump TariffsUPI New RulesGST collectionsJulia HymanTop TrendingWWE Summerslam HighlightsHailee SteinfeldsTop Richest Billionaries in the worldEarthquake VideoLebron James WifeRJ MahvashGerman Influencer BengaluruKannada signboard ruleNayara EnergyIndia US Crude OilTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteHailee Steinfeld's latest workout photos break the internetGabrielle Union on menopause: 'It makes it hard' — motherhood now more emotional, exhaustingIND vs ENG Live: India need eight wickets to level the series 2-2Who is Matt Deitke?

Video/PTI NEW DELHI: Continuous heavy rainfall on Saturday brought large parts of Bihar’s capital Patna to a standstill, causing severe waterlogging and traffic congestion. Visuals from Kurji Road and other low-lying areas showed flooded streets, traffic jams, and pedestrians struggling to navigate waterlogged roads.Kerala Hit by Earliest Monsoon Since 2009 | IMD Predicts Above-Normal Rainfall for 2025The flood-like situation disrupted normal life and exposed administrative lapses in monsoon preparedness. Despite repeated assurances by civic authorities about improved drainage systems and better planning, the city appeared unprepared once again.Commuters faced long traffic jams in various parts of the city, as vehicles were stuck or slowed down due to waterlogging. Pedestrians were seen wading through flooded roads with extreme caution, fearing open manholes, uncovered drains, and the threat of electric shocks from submerged wires and poles.PollWhat do you think is the biggest issue causing urban flooding during monsoon?Poor drainage systemsLack of planning and maintenanceMeanwhile, the India Meteorological Department has predicted heavy rainfall in the region over the next few days.Moreover, contaminated water triggered a diarrhea outbreak in Bihar's Jehanabad.

House razings to save Niger capital's forest shield dismay locals
Hamissou Issiakou grumbled as he worked to strip bare his house, marked for demolition for illegally encroaching on the tip of green forest that's keeping the expanding desert at bay from Niger's capital. Director General of Water and Forests within the environment ministry Yacouba Seybou said on state television that since 2004 "decrees have prohibited housing in the (green) belt".

Director General of Water and Forests within the environment ministry Yacouba Seybou said on state television that since 2004 "decrees have prohibited housing in the (green) belt". Representative image (AFP) NIAMEY: Hamissou Issiakou grumbled as he worked to strip bare his house, marked for demolition for illegally encroaching on the tip of green forest that's keeping the expanding desert at bay from Niger's capital.His is one of nearly 500 homes being bulldozed as the authorities in the arid desert country, which is particularly at risk from man-made global warming, seek to shore up the wooded belt around Niamey's outskirts.Ukraine Launches MASSIVE Drone Attack On Russia; 3 Killed, Over 100 UAVs Shot Down"We've bought our plots of land at great expense. In the end it's a big waste," Issiakou told AFP, after urging workers to hurry up and remove an enormous gate before the police arrive. Since the heavy machinery began rolling in at the end of June, dozens of slums, luxury houses and apartment blocks have tumbled like a house of cards.Some homeowners have just stood by and watched in dismay as the bulldozers tore down their houses. Others, like Issiakou, have rushed to remove anything of value before the two-week notice period was up, from windows, metal sheets and electrical cables to small drinking water tanks and surveillance cameras.All say they bought their land from private real-estate agencies. - 'Submit to Allah' -In a country with one of the highest population growth rates in the world, the number of residents in Niamey has doubled since 2005, from 750,000 to one-and-a-half million, according to the national statistics institute. Thanks to that rapid urbanisation, the forest belt has lost more than half its area since it was completed in 1993 and now measures just 25 kilometres (16 miles) long and a kilometre wide. Hailing from various social classes, the woods' soon-to-be-gone inhabitants were originally attracted to the capital's outskirts by the good quality of life and reasonable cost of a plot. The distance from the bureaucracy within Niamey proper, which can often delay construction projects by years, did not hurt either. Thermos in hand, Aboul-Razak Moussa handed out coffee to the workmen using crowbars to dig up the cobblestones in the courtyard of his brand-new building."I bought the land for 12 million CFA francs ($21,000) and invested 127 million CFA francs (more than $220,000) to build my building," the owner of a welding company lamented."We submit ourselves to Allah." Businessman Ali Hamza was indignant."We're in the peak of the rainy season, it's inhuman," the father-of-10 argued. So far, at least 4,000 people have been evicted and nearly 500 homes, mostly slums, demolished, authorities say.- Rising temperatures -Carparks, petrol stations, pharmacies, shops, rubbish dumps and health centres sprung up to cater for those who made their home in the forested area.The project to introduce a green belt around Niamey is not part of the African Union's flagship Great Green Wall initiative, but its aims are the same.Landlocked Niger lies in the heart of the Sahel, a semiarid region stretching from Senegal to Sudan where temperatures are rising 1.5 times faster than the global average.At the same time, Niger suffers periods of drought and severe flooding.It is "imperative" that Niger "preserves more green spaces", Sani Ayouba, head of the Young Volunteers for the Environment NGO said.Director General of Water and Forests within the environment ministry Yacouba Seybou said on state television that since 2004 "decrees have prohibited housing in the (green) belt".Under the law, offenders face three months to two years in prison.Former ministers have "authorised private housing developments", Boubacar Maman, an official at the urban planning ministry, said.The environment ministry says a zoo and aquatic park as well as a botanic garden, sports and leisure area will soon be created within the forested green belt.bh/bam/bdi/sbk-kjm/yadEnd of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousTransform your boring sandals with trendy DIY embellishmentsLifestyleBhagyashri Borse's style statementsEntertainmentFrom Pulitzer to Orange: 10 prestigious awards given for LiteratureLifestyle10 veggies that can grow in containers in balconyLifestyle'Kingom' actor Vijay Deverakonda’s stylish looksEntertainmentVijay Deverakonda’s fitness workout routineEntertainmentTop 10 colour-changing birds of IndiaLifestyleRaksha Bandhan-worthy mehendi designs to try this yearLifestyle10 things to know before getting an Arowana fish for good luckLifestyleMouni Roy’s top 10 gorgeous ethnic lookstv Next123 Photostories  Top 6 zoos to visit across India for a complete wildlife experience10 minute daily habits that are perfect brain exercisesBigg Boss Malayalam 7 Contestant Aryan Kathuria: All about the handsome actor featured in a Poonam Pandey show6 healthy smart foods for babies when their teeth hurtFrom white themed rooms to aesthetic details: Debinna Bonnerjee’s living and bedroom give peaceful vibesHow to spend 5 days in Madhya Pradesh: The perfect Orchha–Khajuraho itineraryRisk of type 1 diabetes may depend on where childhood is spentBigg Boss Malayalam 7 contestant Abhisree: All about the actor-dancer with an inspiring journey5 filling foods under 50 calories7 key boundaries mentally strong people set to thrive at work123Hot PicksKamala HarrisIndian NavyJ&K landslideTrump TariffsUPI New RulesGST collectionsJulia HymanTop TrendingWWE Summerslam HighlightsHailee SteinfeldsTop Richest Billionaries in the worldEarthquake VideoLebron James WifeRJ MahvashGerman Influencer BengaluruKannada signboard ruleNayara EnergyIndia US Crude OilTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire Website'Disgraceful': Ex-South Korea president Yoon Suk Yeol resists questioning by laying down in underwear;

Southeastern Turkey is reeling under a record-breaking heatwave, with temperatures exceeding 50C in Silopi. Residents are struggling with soaring electricity bills due to constant air conditioning use and are appealing for state support. Deforestation and policy changes allowing mining on agricultural lands exacerbate the heat, intensifying the challenges faced by locals who depend on air conditioning as a necessity.

Residents are struggling with soaring electricity bills due to constant air conditioning use and are appealing for state support. Deforestation and policy changes allowing mining on agricultural lands exacerbate the heat, intensifying the challenges faced by locals who depend on air conditioning as a necessity. Representative Image  A choking heatwave left astonished locals in southeastern Turkey calling for state help to pay their air conditioning bills after the temperature surged past 50 degree celsius."We cannot cope with the heat," ice-cream maker Recep Esiyok, 59, told AFP in Silopi, where meteorologists measured 50.5C on Friday -- a national record."I've been living in Silopi for about 30 years. I've never seen such heat... I've never seen such heat anywhere."He is getting through the heatwave thanks to the air conditioner in his shop, but is now worried about paying for the electricity."My bill last month was 59,000 lira (1,450 dollars). We are asking for state support on this issue."'Incomparable' heat: Before Friday's record, the previous peak in Turkey had been 49.5 degree celsius in August 2023.Scientists agree that climate change caused by humans burning fossil fuels is increasing the likelihood, length and intensity of heatwaves."The heat has reached a point where it's incomparable to previous years," said Halil Coskun, 52, a local reporter.The country is still in the grip of the heatwave and since Sunday temperatures overall have surged from six to 12 degrees above seasonal norms, according to the state meteorology directorate.Wildfire threat: Turkey has fought fires in several regions since the start of the summer. Last week, 10 people perished while fighting a fire in Eskisehir province.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday the country has experienced drier conditions than normal over the past five years as a result of global warming."Extreme heat, low humidity, and strong winds are unfortunately increasing the risk of fire," he said.He said the state was using drones to monitor and protect forests.The streets were relatively empty and the atmosphere tense in Silopi, a Kurdish city whose main income is trade with Iraq across the border 10 kilometres (six miles) away."When it's hot, there's no one outside during the day," said Esiyok.Deforestation complaints: Other locals complained at the lack of vegetation to provide relief around the town, which lies at the foot of a mountain."Unfortunately, the forests here were burned in the past for security reasons," said Coskun.He said the Turkish army cleared them in the search for fighters from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a rebel group that recently disarmed.Turkey's parliament this month also passed a bill that opens certain agricultural lands including olive groves to mining activities, despite widespread opposition."We could at least minimise the heat by planting trees, not by felling them," Coskun said.Electricity bills: Sweating in his kebab shop, another local, Cemil Seher, said that summers in Silopi last not three months, but five.For Seher, 51, air conditioning is no longer a luxury but a necessity."AC is essential here as much as bread and water," he said."When the air conditioners are running, the electricity bills are very high," he said, demanding authorities offer discounts for businesses."I want a discount not only for Silopi but for the entire region from here to Sanliurfa" in the east, he said."I am not making a profit because I've been working... to pay my electricity bill."Discover stories of India’s leading eco-innovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksKamala HarrisBogota AirportUS Oil ReserveTrump TariffsUPI New RulesStarlink SatelliteJulia HymanTop TrendingTravis KelceTom BradyBengaluru Boy Kidnap MurderCBSE Class 10th Sample PapersHow new nep rule worksYuzvendra Chahal DatingStephen CurryJoe BurrowBlake LivelyTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website40 jobs AI can't touch in 2025, says Microsoft Research: Is your career on the list?Former PM HD Devegowda's grandson Prajwal Revanna convicted for raping 47-year-old domestic helpIND vs ENG Live: Rain likely to play spoilsport as India eye 300; Woakes ruled outUPI new rules 2025: New NPCI changes kick in from August 1 - All you need to knowSSC exam 2025 glitches spark massive nationwide protest: Here’s why #SSCMisManagement is trending on social mediaCAT 2025 registration begins at iimcat.ac.in: Check direct link to apply online hereAP Police Constable final result 2025 released at slprb.ap.gov.in; check direct link hereIs Yuzvendra Chahal dating RJ Mahvash?

Chinese sub discovers deepest-ever creatures 10 km undersea
A Chinese submersible has discovered thousands of worms and molluscs nearly 10 kilometres (six miles) below sea level in the Mariana Trench, the deepest colony of creatures ever observed, a study revealed on Wednesday. Last year, the Chinese submersible "Fendouzhe" -- or "Striver" -- dove 23 times into the depths of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean with researchers on board, according to the study in the journal Nature.

Last year, the Chinese submersible "Fendouzhe" -- or "Striver" -- dove 23 times into the depths of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean with researchers on board, according to the study in the journal Nature. AP file photo PARIS: A Chinese submersible has discovered thousands of worms and molluscs nearly 10 kilometres (six miles) below sea level in the Mariana Trench, the deepest colony of creatures ever observed, a study revealed on Wednesday.The discovery in Earth's deepest underwater valley suggests that there could be much more life thriving in the hostile conditions at the bottom of our planet's largely unexplored oceans than previously thought, the China-led team of scientists said.Almost all life on Earth is supported by light from the Sun. However, in the total darkness at the bottom of the world, these creatures live off of chemicals such as methane seeping through cracks in the seafloor, a process called chemosynthesis.Last year, the Chinese submersible "Fendouzhe", or "Striver", dove 23 times into the depths of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean with researchers on board, according to the study in the journal Nature.They found colonies of thousands of marine tubeworms and molluscs called bivalves at depths ranging from 2,500 to 9,533 metres (8,200 to 31,000 feet) deep. Video released alongside the study showed fields of tubeworms, which grew up to 30 centimetres (12 inches) long, as well as piles of molluscs and clams. Spiky crustaceans, free-floating marine worms, sea cucumbers, feathery-armed sea lilies and other invertebrates were also recorded in the depths.The study marked "the discovery of the deepest and the most extensive chemosynthesis-based communities known to exist on Earth," its authors said.Given that other ocean trenches are similar, "such chemosynthesis-based communities might be more widespread than previously anticipated," they added.The researchers said they also found "compelling evidence" that methane was being produced by microbes, with the tubeworms tending to cluster around microbial mats that resemble snow. Previous studies have found thriving communities of single-cell organisms on the ocean floor, but few large animals.But a remotely operated vehicle discovered tubeworms and other marine invertebrates living in hydrothermal vents in the crust below the seafloor two kilometres deep in the Pacific, research said last year.Pressure rising The new study was published as nations wrangle over the contentious issue of deep-sea mining. China, the United States and others have expressed interest in mining the depths for valuable minerals.Ocean scientists warn that mining the little-explored seafloor, one of the last wild zones on the planet, could decimate fragile ecosystems that are not yet well understood.Despite recent talks, the International Seabed Authority -- which oversees deep-sea mining in international waters -- has yet to adopt long-awaited rules governing the industry. Chinese media has previously reported that the Fendouzhe submersible mission will conduct research on "deep-sea materials".Only a handful of people have ever visited the bottom of the Mariana Trench, which is a crescent-shaped depression in the Earth's crust that is deeper than Mount Everest is high.The first explorers visited the trench in 1960 on a brief expedition.But after that, there were no missions until Hollywood director James Cameron made the first solo trip to the bottom in 2012, describing a "desolate" and "alien" environment.The water pressure at the bottom of the trench is a crushing eight tons per square inch, more than a thousand times the atmospheric pressure at sea level.Discover stories of India’s leading eco-innovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksKamala HarrisBogota AirportUS Oil ReserveTrump TariffsUPI New RulesStarlink SatelliteJulia HymanTop TrendingTravis KelceTom BradyBengaluru Boy Kidnap MurderCBSE Class 10th Sample PapersHow new nep rule worksYuzvendra Chahal DatingStephen CurryJoe BurrowBlake LivelyTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteSSC exam 2025 glitches spark massive nationwide protest: Here’s why #SSCMisManagement is trending on social mediaCAT 2025 registration begins at iimcat.ac.in: Check direct link to apply online hereAP Police Constable final result 2025 released at slprb.ap.gov.in; check direct link hereIs Yuzvendra Chahal dating RJ Mahvash?

An aerial view of the Don River in the newly unveiled Biidaasige Park, part of Toronto's Port Lands Flood Protection Project, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (AFP photo) TORONTO: The spur to build Toronto's billion-dollar-plus flood prevention project dates back to a devastating hurricane in 1954, but planners say its urgency was reinforced by the recent tragic flooding in Texas.The Port Lands project has, in part, reversed a consequence of industrialization by reconnecting Lake Ontario with the Don River, more than a century after they were severed to create an industrial area.Chris Glaisek, chief planning officer at the municipal body Waterfront Toronto, said the idea was to "heal the land from the way it was repurposed 100 years ago," with a focus on "flood protection and naturalization."The complex project -- one of the largest in Toronto's history with a cost of Can$1.4 billion (US$1 billion) -- included digging a river valley and the creation of two new river outlets, with wetlands and marshes to absorb excess water during extreme storms.The mouth of the Don River was once the Great Lakes system's largest fresh water marsh, a rich habitat and vital food resource for Indigenous people before colonization.But Toronto, like many North American cities, saw industrial growth in the late 19th Century.Much of the marsh was drained and filled in to make room for a port industrial area, while the river was re-routed into a man-made channel. The Port Lands never thrived as an industrial area, leaving a vast stretch of eastern downtown under-used, and the Don River became polluted. "It was really dirty, it was foul, it was terrible," Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow said recently. - Hurricane Hazel -On October 15, 1954 Hurricane Hazel hit Toronto, after hammering parts of the Caribbean and eastern United States.It killed 81 people across the Greater Toronto Area and served as catalyst for the city to get serious about flood protection. Hazel flooded the Humber River, in western Toronto, but Glaisek said "it was understood at the time that that same amount of rainfall, had it landed on the (eastern) Don, would have done a comparable amount of damage." He called Hazel an initial "impetus" to re-naturalize the Port Lands, but rising awareness over the past two decades about the causal link between climate change and extreme floods helped advance the project. - 'Duty bound' -To reclaim the Port Lands, Toronto partnered with the US-based landscape architecture firm Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, which has worked on the Brooklyn Bridge Park and the Obama Presidential Center in Chicago.Laura Solano, the lead designer, said the project was "duty bound to address catastrophic flooding," but stressed it offered "much more."Because the area has been reformed to cope with flood waters, parts have been declared safe for new housing -- an urgent need in the expensive metropolis.There is also a new park, trails and people can canoe or kayak through the rehabilitated Don.Solano stressed Toronto's initial decision to alter the area was consistent with the times, when North American cities moved to "industrialize their waters...to raise their economic position."But now, "every city is looking to reclaim their waters," she told AFP. The Port Lands "shows the world that it's possible to fix the past and turn deficit and remnant industrial lands into living and breathing infrastructure."- 'The river is going to flood' -As Glaisek described the project, he stood on a bank that would, by design, be under water during a major storm."It's all planned so that it can flood, the water level can rise, the river can get about three, maybe four times wider than it is now, absorb all of that volume of water," he said. "When the storm event subsides, it will shrink back down to this."It's a planning approach that recognizes "we're seeing more and more of these events.""Like in Texas, you see very tragic outcomes when you haven't really tried to plan for nature," he told AFP, referring to flash floods in early July that killed at least 135 people. He urged planners to "reposition" their relationship to nature and ditch the mindset that "humans (can) control everything.""Let's acknowledge the river is going to flood. Let's build the space for it." bs/desEnd of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousWhen Mrunal Thakur wore the most wedding-worthy Banarasi sareeLifestyle10 Indian baby names inspired by Indian languages and scriptsLifestyle10 interesting facts about Kiran Desai and her Booker Prize 2025 longlisted bookLifestyleShobha Shetty’s top 10 half-saree lookstv8 air-purifying plants for your homeLifestyleIn pics: Glamorous looks of actress Bindhu MadhavitvTake cues from Rashmika Mandanna's traditional attires this ShravanEntertainmentKnow the pros and cons of using derma rollers for faster hair growthLifestyleSai Pallavi and her love for eyelinersEntertainment10 most-friendly animals in India!Lifestyle Next123 Photostories  Priyanka Chopra said NO to these 5 hit films - Guess who got them insteadBehind the villain’s mask, Ranjeet’s real story will surprise you5 miracle oils that can actually help grow hair on bald patchesKidney vs Gallbladder stones: What's the difference and 5 very early symptoms you shouldn’t ignoreWhy are Guppy and Swordtail fish ideal starter options for new aquarists5 Friendship Day-perfect destinations in India to reconnect with your old buddiesGrow these 5 vegetables in pots – No backyard neededNo bad time to travel: 7 Indian destinations that are great year-roundTop 5 foods for muscle recoveryTrain the brain to love discipline: 7 habits that can help123Hot PicksMeteor ShowersOperation MahadevP&G CEOIndia US TradeLenskart IPOTCS share priceJulia HymanTop TrendingTaylor SwiftNBA Trade RumorsNazem KadriJarred VanderbiltBoeing 787 DreamlinerYankee Stadium Viral videoDeandre AytonVanessa BryantIndia US Trade AgreementNHL Trade RumorsTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteLondon airspace shut: All outbound UK flights hit by air traffic control 'technical issue'Saudi Arabia’s EV maker, Lucid, breaks world record with 1,205 km drive across Europe in single chargeSaikat Chakrabarti vs Nancy Pelosi: Meet Indian-American challenging Godmother of Dem Party — in her own backyardExplained: Why a Russian earthquake triggered tsunami alerts in Hawaii, Japan, and the US West CoastUAE: Will influencers need an advertiser permit to post on social media?

Mehar’s custom-engineered drone reached this remarkable milestone in an astonishing 0.91 seconds, a feat that not only demonstrates his technical prowess but also sets a new benchmark in the rapidly evolving world of drone technology.Mehar’s journey to this achievement has been anything but straightforward. His fascination with drones began in 8th grade, and this passion has only deepened over the years. With a keen interest in pushing technological boundaries, Mehar embarked on a months-long project to build a drone capable of unparalleled vertical acceleration.“I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of pushing the limits of what drones can do,” Mehar explained. “But breaking a world record wasn’t just about the end result; it was about the process. I wanted to prove that current technology could achieve something extraordinary, but the path to get there was filled with challenges.”The project required Mehar to design, test, and refine multiple drone prototypes. “There were moments when I felt like I was chasing an impossible dream,” Mehar recalled. “I went through countless designs, and many of them failed during testing. Some drones crashed so badly that I had no choice but to go back to the drawing board and start from scratch. Each crash was a setback, but it also sparked new ideas and innovations.”Undeterred by the setbacks, Mehar poured his energy into creating a drone that was not only fast but also aerodynamically optimized. “I spent countless hours on CAD software, meticulously designing and tweaking each component. The goal was to make the drone as streamlined as possible, which led me to shape it like a rocket. This design wasn’t just about aesthetics; it was about reducing drag and maximizing speed.”Mehar’s dedication to his craft paid off in spectacular fashion. “Every failure taught me something valuable,” he said. “It forced me to think creatively and to consider every detail, from the materials used to the weight distribution of the drone. The process was grueling, but it was also incredibly rewarding to see my ideas take flight—literally.”This record-breaking achievement is more than just a personal triumph for Mehar; it has significant implications for the future of drone technology. “The possibilities are endless,” Mehar mused. “High-speed vertical acceleration could revolutionize everything from emergency response to space exploration. This isn’t just about setting a record; it’s about opening doors to new innovations and applications.”Mehar’s groundbreaking work has already begun to inspire others in the drone community and beyond. “I hope this accomplishment encourages other young innovators to push their own boundaries,” he said. “Technology is advancing rapidly, and there’s so much potential waiting to be unlocked. I’m excited to see where we can go from here.”As Mehar looks ahead, the sky is truly the limit. With his record-breaking drone, he has not only made history but also set the stage for future breakthroughs in drone technology. And for this young innovator, this is just the beginning of an exciting journey into the future of flight.Disclaimer: Content produced by Mediawire on Behalf of Shweta SinghEnd of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaTop TrendingAllen IversonCam SkatteboLebron JamesDwyane WadeSharmishtha PanoliDerrick HenryTurkish Airlines DGCA warningBrad MarchandWhere to Watch NBA FinalBengaluru NewsTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteTrump ally Laura Loomer says Republican law makers wondering if they should side with President Trump or Elon Musk; Tesla CEO responds: Trump has 3.5 years left as President, but I ...Rise in COVID-19 Cases: 7 essential medical gadgets for home useThis is likely Elon Musk’s ‘Most Read’ tweet on Donald TrumpIt's War out there: Donald Trump says very disappointed with Elon Musk; Tesla CEO respondsKeep EV subsidies with you, but ..., says Very Angry Elon Musk to Donald TrumpRobots could soon replace humans to deliver your Amazon ordersAsus launches a mouse that literally makes work smell betterHow Steve Ballmer may have just agreed with Android co-founder for Bill Gates being responsible for Microsoft losing $400 billion-plus in smartphone warPoland's biggest game developer brings cyberpunk 2077 to Nintendo for the first timeMumbai's second Apple Store likely to open in Borivali: Rent, lease period and other details revealed‘Her laptop is still on the office table, but she is not’: Bengaluru techie dream ends in grief"Not knowing Calvin is wild": New York Giants rookie Cam Skattebo leaves NFL fans in disbelief after failing to recognize NFL legends in viral quiz“The true definition of a son” -NBA legend Allen Iverson shares heartfelt post on his son days after making sweet gesture towards ex-wife“Harshest critics”: Wayne Gretzky's daughter Paulina Gretzky on overcoming criticism and learning to love herself unapologeticallyUkraine's drone attack on Russia used open-source software, 'upset' developer says wanted to make flying robots: 'not in a million years...'Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis: If I were a student right now, I would study ...“It was really hard for me”- LeBron James’ wife Savannah reveals how being a teenage mother negatively impacted her sense of identityFBI reacts to Colorado attacker Mohamed Sabry Soliman not being charged with terror: 'We are not Federal Bureau of Word Games'Eid al-Adha prayer timings announced across UAE – find out the time in your cityUAE Golden Visa: Which universities make you eligible?

Doordarshan will telecast live the Mangala, Shringaar, Rajbhog, Sandhya, and Shayan Aartis offered to the Ram Lalla idol at the Ayodhya Ram temple on DD National, connecting devotees who can't visit the temple. National broadcaster Doordarshan has good news for Lord Ram Devotees. Doordarshan has announced that it will telecast live the morning prayers offered to the Ram Lalla idol at the Ram Temple in Ayodhya every day.Doordarshan has shared the same in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Doordarshan said that the morning aarti offered to Ram Lalla will be telecast live on DD National every morning from 6:30 am.The national broadcaster said that the decision to telecast the morning aarti live every day was taken with the aim of connecting devotees of Lord Ram, especially after the temple was inaugurated less than two months ago in a grand ceremony and everyone can't visit the temple in person. The Aarti will be telecast simultaneously on DD’s YouTube channel also.Secondly, the decision was taken because the Trust doesn’t have logistical arrangements as of now for a live broadcast. Therefore, DD will be posting a two-three-member crew on the temple premises for the coverage of the daily ritual.DD's announcement to telecast the Aarti live for 30 minutes every morning comes after getting the go-ahead from the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust for the same. Initially, DD will air the “Mangala aarti” for a few months, and then, the Ram Temple Trust will take a call on how to take it forward.6 Aartis daily at the Ayodhya Ram templeThere are 6 aartis of Ram Lalla held daily in Ayodhya Ram temple. These include Mangala Aarti at 4:30 am, Shringaar Aarti at 6:30 am, Rajbhog Aarti at 12 noon, Utthapan Aarti at 2 pm, Sandhya Aarti at 7 pm, and Shayan Aarti at 10 pm.Giving directions to devotees for Aarti, the temple trust said, "Entry for Mangala Aarti at 4 AM, Shringar Aarti at 6:15 AM, and Shayan Aarti at 10 PM is possible only with an entry pass. No entry passes required for other Aartis."Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust advisory to devoteesIn an advisory to devotees coming for darshan at the temple, the Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra said, "Devotees can enter the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir for Darshan from 6:30 AM to 9:30 PM. The entire process from entry to exit after Darshan at the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir is extremely simple and convenient. Typically, devotees can have a smooth Darshan of Prabhu Shri Ram Lalla Sarkar within 60 to 75 minutes."The temple trust advised devotees to leave their mobile phones, footwear, purses and other personal items outside the Mandir premises for their convenience and to save time.It has also asked devotees not to bring flowers, garlands, Prasad to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

The design aims to eliminate the hinge crease and reduce the device's thickness while offering added benefits and durability. However, its practicality remains uncertain. Microsoft discontinues Surface Duo smartphones but files a patent for a new foldable device with a single hinge system called 'spine cover plate'. The design aims to eliminate the hinge crease and reduce the device's thickness while offering added benefits and durability. However, its practicality remains uncertain. Microsoft did not get the success it was anticipating with its Android-powered Surface Duo-series smartphones. The company has discontinued the lineup after the Duo 2. But, this does not mean the company has stopped trying. A new patent application filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29, reveals that the company is working on another foldable or dual-display mobile device.The patent application describes the company’s take on the foldable smartphone concept with single hinge technology called “spine cover plate”.Next Microsoft smartphones could feature a Galaxy Z Fold-like designAccording to the patent application, the phone could feature a “flexible display” in a bookstyle design similar to Galaxy Z Fold decies. However, the entire focus is on the spine cover plate mechanism which is aimed at protecting the single-hinge system of the device by covering the structural element. The differentiating factor between the regular hinge and Microsoft’s design is that the spine cover adjusts automatically during the opening and closing of the phone to prevent any unnecessary gaps around the hinge to protect it from dust as well as water. Currently, Samsung’s design offers an IPX8 rating which makes their foldables water-resistant only.The patent further mentions that the new hinge mechanism could allow Microsoft to eliminate the hinge crease less visible than the current options available in the market. Moreover, Microsoft has also mentioned techniques that could allow them to reduce the overall thickness of the foldable smartphone by allowing the spine cover plate to move closer to the device’s hinge when folded. “By retracting the spine cover plate toward the central spine as the first display-supporting frame and the second display-supporting frame are rotated into a face-to-face orientation, the width of the folded computing device is reduced, thereby enabling easier and more comfortable handling of the device, such as with one hand,” Microsoft noted in the patent.Interesting idea, but practicality is a question markThe entire smartphone market is searching for a way to eliminate the foldable crease from their smartphones. Some brands have already implemented the water-drop folding mechanism to reduce it, but there’s nothing like a crease-free foldable out there. Apart from that, the durability quotient of foldable is also important considering all the movable parts these phones have. That said, adding another layer or a movable part on top of the entire foldable mechanism does not appear like a wise move despite the added benefits and durability Microsoft has explained in the patent application.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Initiatives include partnering with the Election Commission, prioritizing trusted content on YouTube, and implementing advertising policies for transparency. Measures against AI-generated content are also taken. Google has announced a series of initiatives aimed at supporting the democratic process and safeguarding its platforms from abuse during the upcoming Indian General Election. With millions of eligible voters heading to the polls, the tech giant has said that recognises its responsibility to connect users with reliable information and counter the spread of misinformation, including AI-generated content.Easy access to voting information on Search and YouTubeGoogle has mentioned that its primary focus is on providing easy access to authoritative information from trusted sources.The company has also partnered with the Election Commission of India to showcase critical details on Google Search and YouTube, such as how to register and vote, in English and Hindi. Apart from this, YouTube’s recommendation system will prioritise trusted content during the election season. Additionally, YouTube’s homepage will prominently showcase trusted content along with an “Up Next” panel to make election-related details easily available for users. YouTube will also highlight content from trusted sources during key moments through its Top News and Breaking News as well as a news watch page. Moreover, the tech giant has also set up information panels that indicate funding sources from publishers that receive public or government funding and information panels that provide topical context for topics prone to misinformation. Safeguarding misinformationTo protect the integrity of the electoral process and to protect its products and services from abuse, Google has re-inforced its existing policies to keep its products and platforms safe while curbing misinformation at the same time. Also, the policies apply to all users, irrespective of the content type. The company has employed a combination of human reviewers and artificial intelligence models to identify and remove content that violates these policies. Google's AI capabilities are enhancing its abuse-fighting efforts, enabling faster action against emerging threats.Advertising during election campaignsTo keep things transparent when it comes to election advertising, the company requires advertisers to undergo identity verification and provide necessary certifications from the Election Commission. Election ads must also include disclosures indicating the advertiser's identity and location. Google maintains a searchable hub for all election ads, providing insights into the advertisers and their spending.Restricting AI-generated contentGoogle has also taken some steps to help identify AI-generated content through new tools and policies. The company has introduced disclosure requirements for election ads containing synthetic content and will soon require creators on YouTube to label realistic altered or synthetic content. The new ad policies prohibit the use of manipulated media to mislead people, like deepfakes or doctored content.Google has also implemented restrictions to Gemini on the types of election-related queries it will respond to and has also prioritised the provision of high-quality information. Additional features, such as the "About this Image" tool in Search and digital watermarking for AI-generated images, aim to provide users with context and assess credibility.Furthermore, Google has joined the C2PA coalition, a cross-industry effort to provide transparency and context for AI-generated content. The company has confirmed the deployment of technology to counter harmful AI-generated content aimed at deceiving voters during the 2024 elections.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

TSMC's stock rallied, elevating its market capitalisation to a record, making it higher than Broadcom. Analysts expect TSMC to further advance amid surging AI-related revenue and strong pricing power.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has reclaimed a spot in the list of the world’s 10 most valuable companies, riding the optimism of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom in the tech industry that pushed its stock to record levels.According to a report by Bloomberg, TSMC’s stock rallied 14% last week, elevating the chipmaker’s market capitalisation to a record, before a 2% decline in early trading on Monday (March 11), pared it to $634 billion. However, the decline didn’t impact the company much as it still has a market share higher than that of Broadcom, the report noted.What analysts have to sayAnalysts from Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. expect the semiconductor giant – that has Apple, Nvidia and Qualcomm as its customers – to advance further amid surging AI-related revenue and strong pricing power. “Generative AI semi is an obvious growth driver for TSMC,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Charlie Chan wrote in a note last week. The company’s overseas expansion also helps mitigate geopolitical concerns, they said.TSMC’s revenue gained 9.4% in the first two months of 2024 as demand for high-end chips increased due to a wave of activity in AI.Nvidia gets ‘AI boost’This is not the first time this year that a chip company has seen its stock on an upward spiral. This year, Nvidia was among the companies that got a boost by a frenzy around generative AI.In the last month, Nvidia stock price has risen over 20% while in the last six months, it has risen over 90%. Moreover, in the last one year, Nvidia stock price has appreciated from $234.36 per share level to $875.28 per share mark – registering a 275% jump.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Google Maps is updating its Fused Orientation Provider (FOP) API to improve direction accuracy in busy areas. The update combines gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer data, reducing magnetic interference and benefiting Google Maps and third-party apps on Android 5.0 or above. We keep hearing about Google Maps fiasco from across the globe where it directed people in some odd direction and eventually got them stuck in a ‘worst case scenario’. Now a new post published on the Android Developers blog gives an insight about Maps getting a new update to better with directions. The post talks about a potential upgrade that Maps will be getting with the Fused Orientation Provider (FOP) API that aims to make the ‘orientation’ detection better on Android devices, irrespective of the hardware used by different OEMs on their devices. According to the post, the update will make Maps interpret the directions better to make it more accurate by combining the gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer data. However, this idea of Google using data from all the sensors isn’t new, the company has used the API before, but the update will make better magnetic interference. As per the post, the changes will not only apply to Google Maps but also third-party apps that rely on Google Maps to offer navigational data. It is to be noted that the update will be done with internals of the Google Maps, it won’t affect the user interface or the layout of the app. Also, the updated API will be rolled out from the server side or via the app update in Android devices running Android 5.0 or above. How it will affect usersAs mentioned, the update won’t change anything in terms of the app’s design or user interface. The changes are internal in the form of API which will be pushed automatically via the update. That said, the update is set to make it better with directions, especially in busy areas.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Musk announces xAI open sourcing Grok chatbot. OpenAI CEO Altman takes a dig at Musk's chatbot. Musk, obviously didn't like the jab and replied with a long-ish message saying “GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.”  Elon Musk has been extremely critical of ChatGPT maker OpenAI for deviating from its mission to develop AI for the benefit of humanity and taking a profit-making path. He has advocated that artificial intelligence (AI) should be accessible for all, and he has now announced that his AI startup xAI will open source Grok chatbot this week.“This week, @xAI will open source Grok,” Musk said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).In simpler words, open-sourcing a software, like a chatbot, means that the software projects are redistributable as all source code is accessible by everyone. One of the advantages of having open source software is that it provides flexibility to an enterprise to have multiple ways of fixing a problem rather than waiting for an internal team to provide a solution.“OpenAI is a lie”Meanwhile, a user suggested that OpenAI should do the same.“OpenAI should do the same if they are ‘open’ that is,” the user said. Musk replied, “OpenAI is a lie.”Musk wants AI technology to be open-source Musk had floated the idea of open-sourcing AI during a podcast in November last year. In a podcast with Lex Fridman, Musk suggested that he likes the idea of open-source AI. “I am generally in favour of open sourcing, like biassed towards open sourcing,” he said.His comments came soon after his AI company called xAI released Grok, its chatbot, which reportedly took four months to build. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was quick to take a dig at this and shared a post in which he built Grok with a single prompt on GPT Builder."GPTs can save a lot of effort:” he said.Musk, obviously didn't like the jab and replied with a long-ish message saying “GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.” About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Ruby Johnson filed a lawsuit against Detective Gary Staab and Sgt. Gregory Buschy.  Apple's Find My app has cost the city of Denver, US $3.76 million in compensation and damages. In 2022, the city’s police wrongly raided and ransacked an elderly woman's home looking for a stolen truck and guns. According to a report by CNN, Denver police were seeking to recover a stolen truck loaded with guns, ammo and cash. For this, the police used Apple's Find My technology on another iPhone to locate the vehicle.However, the police picked the wrong house out of a fairly wide area to storm in and catch the thieves. Due to this misplaced raid, 78-year-old Ruby Johnson filed a lawsuit against the police. As compensation, the city will be paying Johnson a $3.76 million award. Moreover, the defendant officers — Detective Gary Staab and Sgt. Gregory Buschy — were also sued as an individual. Denver police had previously cleared both men of wrongdoing, but the jury disagreed.How Apple’s Find My app played a roleThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) brought the case on behalf of Johnson. The lawsuit mentioned that the raid was conducted based on an “alleged location ping from an iPhone's Find My app that the officers did not understand and for which they had no training." As per the complaint, the police relied on a "Find My" ping from an iPhone 11 that was probably still in the stolen truck. However, the area identified included parts of six other properties across parts of four city blocks.In a statement, Johnson's attorney Tim Macdonald said: “We are disturbed by the lack of training or policy changes and hope that the amount of the punitive damages award will send a strong message that the police department must take seriously the constitutional rights of its residents.” The ACLU and the jury concluded that the two police officers who ordered the raid had no reason to single out Johnson's house as the target. Also, the officers have to pay nearly $1.25 million each in punitive and compensatory damages. A Denver District Court clerk noted that the city has not yet filed an appeal of the verdict.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

A bill to sell TikTok is introduced, backed by President Biden. Kotick discussed acquisition with OpenAI head. Activision Blizzard faced a lawsuit. Concerns about data privacy and ties to China persist. TikTok urges American users to support it.  Bobby Kotick, the former head of Activision Blizzard, is reportedly considering buying TikTok, as the app could be banned in the United States. The Wall Street Journal reports that Kotick has talked to ByteDance, the company that owns TikTok, about buying the app, which could cost hundreds of billions of dollars.This comes as US lawmakers introduce a new bill that would make ByteDance sell TikTok within six months or stop it from being available in US app stores.President Joe Biden has said he would approve the bill if it passes in Congress.The Wall Street Journal report adds that Kotick, the head of OpenAI, Sam Altman, discussed teaming up to buy TikTok at a dinner last week. Kotick's interest in TikTok follows a rough end to his 30 years leading Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft acquired last year. The company faced a lawsuit saying it allowed sexual harassment and discrimination under Kotick's leadership. The Wall Street Journal also said Kotick knew about bad behaviour and didn't tell the board everything. Kotick was accused of harassment, but Activision Blizzard said the report was "misleading."Lawmakers are worried about data privacy and TikTok's ties to China. US President Biden, whose administration has banned the app already on state devices, has expressed his support for banning the app in the US. However, former President Donald Trump, who once wanted to ban TikTok, has changed his mind, saying a ban would help TikTok's rivals, like Facebook and YouTube. As the bill against TikTok gains support, the app has asked its American users to speak up for it, sending messages telling users to call their representatives. The bill, which passed a committee last week, is expected to be approved when the House votes on Wednesday. If it passes, it will then go to the Senate, and then the bill will be signed by the President of the US.Former Activision boss reportedly wants to buy TikTokAbout the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Reason is said to be delay in the delivery of two supercomputers by the French company to Indian weather forecasting institutes. According to a report in news agency PTI, the Earth Sciences Ministry had ordered two supercomputers worth $100 million from French firm Eviden, of the Atos Group, last year to enhance the computing capabilities of its institutions -- the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM)."I am more upset because the target we set was December. The Union Cabinet had already approved purchasing the supercomputer. We have only four petaflop capacity. We want to install up to 18 petaflop capacity," Rijiju told PTI in a video interview.He said that the French company ran into some financial trouble and wanted the government to make payment to its subsidiary.Minister says that the delay is causing him "worry"Rijiju said that the delay has caused him lots of worry as the company has overshot the timeline. "But I think we will sort it out soon," he said, adding that the government wanted to be "very correct in our position legally"."We are ready to release the money because we want the machine immediately. The only problem is the amount is not small. So if we pay now, if the company is bankrupt or something happens, who will bail out," the minister said.Rijiju further added that the government was taking some steps to speed up the delivery of the supercomputer but did not elaborate. "But I hope the French government will also intervene because we have a good understanding and a very good relationship with the French government."Since it is a high-cost equipment, we want to ensure that the transaction happens duly and properly," he said."From outside, everything's ready. It is only the problem with the main company. They want us to pay their subsidiary. We will pay only to a company whom we have entered an MoU with," Rijiju said.The supercomputing system, based on Eviden's BullSequana XH2000, is said to have a combined power capacity of up to 21.3 petaflops.Supercomputer at IITMThe supercomputer at the Pune-based IITM will provide 13 petaflops of computing power for atmosphere and climate research. As per the PTI report, it will integrate 3,000 CPU nodes using AMD EPYC 7643 processors and 26 GPU nodes through NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. The system will benefit from the NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand networking platform with In-Network Computing, 3PB all flash and 29PB disk-based DDN EXAScaler ES400NVX2 storage and Micron high-technology memory.The existing computing facility at NCMRWF is 2.8 petaflops and at IITM is 4 petaflops, respectively.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

“At your age, I was earning much less — you should be happy with what you’re getting,” says Indian manager: Does the Indian scarcity mindset clash with US office norms?
A Reddit post revealed how an Indian manager told an employee, “At your age, I earned less — be happy with your pay.” The incident sparked debate on whether India’s scarcity mindset, shaped by hierarchy and competition, clashes with US workplace norms. While cultural influences play a role, experts stress that toxic management styles aren’t ethnic traits but universal flaws.

While cultural influences play a role, experts stress that toxic management styles aren’t ethnic traits but universal flaws.  A Reddit post recently sparked attention when an employee recounted asking their Indian manager for a raise — only to be told, ‘At your age, I was earning much less — you should be happy with what you’re getting.’ The remark was far from a casual aside; it triggered a broader conversation about whether certain managerial practices of Indians in US workplaces could negatively affect employees.From terse interview exchanges to subtle, everyday biases, employees depicted managers whose conduct weighed heavily on overall workplace morale and engagement. “It’s honestly exhausting to deal with managers like this. Instead of building people up, they drag everyone down with their bitterness and toxic mindset,” the same user reflected.The discussion thread quickly swelled with narratives underscoring experiences of authority, personal insecurities, and generational conditioning. For many, it posed a pressing question: Are these behaviors isolated incidents, or do they indicate a recurring style that can leave employees drained?Not one manager, but many: Why toxic patterns keep repeating at workSeveral Reddit users recounted experiences hinting at systemic patterns rather than singular occurrences. One described an interview in which a manager dismissed their answer as “the worst I have ever heard” and asked them to reconsider it, only to subsequently extend a job offer.Another user highlighted a dissonance between seniority and compensation: “If you are older, he'll tell you — you are very senior — you are expected to perform at a senior level, while paying you a junior-level salary.”These testimonies suggest repeated behaviors that employees found frustrating and taxing, leaving a lasting impact on workplace dynamics and overall employee wellbeing. Yet, looking at these anecdotes as mere oddities would be a mistake. They map onto what one repeatedly hears in corporate hallways — a style of management that prizes control over collaboration, hierarchy over mentorship.Cultural and historical influences on managementSome linked these behaviors to cultural and historical influences. While the notion of a “scarcity mindset” has been discussed online, many emphasized that managerial conduct can be shaped by a complex blend of upbringing, competitive pressures, and hierarchical norms.One Reddit user wrote, “The roots of bad middle management are in the scarcity mindset that gets embedded in all Indians when you grow up in India. Makes you see the world as a zero-sum game — someone needs to lose in order for someone else to win.”This mindset emerges from growing up in environments where resources and opportunities were limited, and advancement often required outcompeting others. It can foster a heightened sense of risk aversion, a protective approach to personal gains, and a belief that for someone to succeed, another must lose — attitudes that, when carried into workplaces, can influence managerial decisions and employee interactions.Culture clash or common flaw? Why it’s not just about Indian managersAttributing this behaviour purely to cultural conditioning risks missing another point: Indian managers in multinational workplaces often straddle two worlds. On the one hand, they inherit habits of caution, deference to hierarchy, and scepticism born of scarcity. On the other, they face Western corporate cultures that reward openness, flat structures, and recognition. The friction between the two can produce managerial habits that appear abrasive, defensive, or excessively controlling to employees.Several Redditors cautioned against broad generalizations. “You are exhibiting the same mentality then. You are typecasting all Indians in the same bracket. And that’s wrong,” one remarked. Another added, “I’ve had managers considered as typical Americans make similar comments. This is not about race or ethnicity but about this manager. Stop stereotyping entire communities.”Insecure or dismissive managerial styles are not confined to any single culture. It is worth remembering that while some patterns may reflect cultural residue, others are universal human failings — insecurity, fear of being outshone, or reluctance to share credit. When those traits coincide with cultural baggage, the outcome feels amplified. That is why generalisations, tempting as they are, flatten nuance and unfairly paint every Indian manager with the same brush.The key lies in identifying patterns that may affect employee engagement and wellbeing without resorting to sweeping assumptions, while establishing frameworks that promote accountability, constructive feedback, and sustainable mentorship.Bottom line: Bad management isn’t an ethnic traitThese narratives, while anecdotal, illuminate the complexities of workplace dynamics under Indian managers in US offices. For employees, the stories underscore the importance of navigating managerial interactions with awareness while advocating for fairness, transparency, and support. For organizations, they highlight the need to foster leadership that balances experience with empathy, and authority with mentorship.If there is a lesson in these stories, it is this: Bad management is not an ethnic trait, but when cultural habits meet unchecked authority, the outcome can feel distinctly patterned.

Google is reinstating in-person interviews to curb AI cheating and preserve candidate integrity, while Meta is piloting AI-assisted interviews, viewing collaboration with AI as the future skill. This divergence highlights a larger debate: Should hiring reward independent fundamentals or the ability to co-create with AI?  When it comes to hiring in tech, Google and Meta are moving in two very different directions, and the divergence could shape the future of work in Silicon Valley. While one company is tightening control over in-person assessments, the other is experimenting with AI as an active partner in interviews. Both moves reflect how artificial intelligence is redefining not just workflows but the very rules of evaluation.The urgency behind these shifts is clear: AI-powered cheating tools have made virtual interviews increasingly unreliable. Candidates are now able to use off-camera assistants to solve coding challenges in real time, blurring the line between genuine skill and AI support. For recruiters, this has turned remote hiring into a minefield, forcing companies like Google and Meta to rethink how they evaluate technical talent in an era dominated by AI.Google brings back in-person interviews For Google, the answer to AI-powered cheating is simple: Bring back face-to-face interactions. CEO Sundar Pichai announced on the Lex Fridman podcast in June that the company would introduce at least one round of in-person interviews to ensure candidates have the necessary fundamentals, according to the podcast. The problem has grown urgent. Software engineering interviews at Google, which rely on real-time coding challenges, have increasingly been compromised by off-camera AI assistance. During a February internal town hall meeting, employees pressed leadership to abandon remote interviews entirely. “Can we get onsite job interviews back?” one employee asked, according to audio recordings reviewed by CNBC. “There are many email threads about this topic. If budget is a constraint, can we get the candidates to an office or environment we can control?”. Brian Ong, Google’s Vice President of Recruiting, admitted that while virtual interviews are faster and easier to schedule, the company faces a fundamental challenge. According to CNBC, he acknowledged, “we definitely have more work to do to integrate how AI is now more prevalent in the interview process.” Some hiring managers report that over 50% of candidates are now cheating during technical interviews, forcing interviewers to probe extensively to assess real understanding, according to CNBC. Pichai’s response is a hybrid approach: A mix of virtual and in-person rounds. “Given we all work hybrid, I think it's worth thinking about some fraction of the interviews being in person. I think it'll help both the candidates understand Google's culture and I think it's good for both sides,” he said on the Lex Fridman podcast. The move signals a sharp reversal from pandemic-era hiring practices. As Ong noted to CNBC, Google isn’t alone in tackling this challenge. Competitor companies are grappling with the same problem, with AI increasingly complicating remote assessments.Industry-wide caution: Anti-cheating measures everywhere Other tech players are also reacting. According to CNBC, Anthropic, the maker of AI chatbot Claude, now explicitly prohibits AI use during applications, requiring candidates to demonstrate “non-AI-assisted communication skills.” Amazon has also begun requiring candidates to acknowledge they won’t use unauthorized tools during interviews. Cisco and McKinsey are also among companies bringing back face-to-face meetings at various stages, while Deloitte has reinstated in-person interviews for its UK graduate program, according to CNBC. For Google, the message is clear: Convenience cannot come at the cost of integrity.Meta takes the opposite path Meanwhile, Meta is exploring a very different approach. According to 404 Media, the company is actively testing AI-enabled interviews where coding candidates can use an artificial intelligence assistant during assessments. An internal memo titled “AI-Enabled Interviews—Call for Mock Candidates” invited employees to participate in mock interviews using AI support, reflecting the “developer environment that our future employees will work in”. A Meta spokesperson told 404 Media, “We’re obviously focused on using AI to help engineers with their day-to-day work, so it should be no surprise that we’re testing how to provide these tools to applicants during interviews”. The company is signaling that collaboration with AI may soon be an expected skill, not an unfair advantage. This aligns with CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s vision. According to the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, he stated that AI agents would soon function as “midlevel engineers” capable of writing code. “Over time,” he added, “we’ll get to a point where a lot of the code in our apps is actually going to be built by AI engineers instead of people engineers”.The Cluely case: A glimpse into the future The concept isn’t purely theoretical. Chungin “Roy” Lee, a Columbia University computer science student, created Interview Coder in early 2024—an AI tool that discreetly assisted candidates during coding interviews. Columbia suspended Lee for a year for violating academic integrity, according to Associated Press, but he later moved to San Francisco, rebranded the product as Cluely, and built it into a stealth-mode AI assistant used in interviews, exams, and meetings. By mid-2025, Cluely had raised over $20 million, including a $15 million Series A led by Andreessen Horowitz. Lee’s defiance is telling. According to Associated Press, he said, “Everyone uses AI now. It doesn't make sense to have systems that test people as if they don't.” Meta’s recent pilot suggests a shift in corporate thinking — from penalizing AI use to building evaluation frameworks around it.What it means for candidates The divergence between Google and Meta points to a broader debate: Should interviews measure raw individual skill, or should they test the ability to collaborate with AI? In Google’s world, fundamentals and independent problem-solving are non-negotiable. At Meta, the ability to co-create with AI may soon become the baseline. For aspiring tech professionals, the message is clear. Understanding AI won’t just be a bonus, it could define employability in the coming years. TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

However, in other regions, schools may function as usual, depending on state directives. With Onam and other festivals also lined up, August has emerged as a month filled with holidays for students.  August continues to be a packed month for students across India, blending academic deadlines with national festivals and state-specific observances. As schools navigate through Independence Day activities and mid-term preparations, another question looms large: Will August 27, the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, bring a school holiday?Ganesh Chaturthi and regional school closuresGanesh Chaturthi, which falls on Wednesday, August 27, 2025, is one of the most widely celebrated festivals in western and southern India. The day marks the birth of Lord Ganesha and is observed with grand processions, pujas, and community celebrations. It is also recognised as a public holiday in states such as Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, and Telangana, where schools might remain closed to allow students and families to participate.In other regions, the holiday status depends on government notifications or school board directives. States where Ganesh Chaturthi is not traditionally observed may continue with regular academic schedules.August 2025: A festive month for studentsThis year, August has brought a cluster of holidays. Independence Day on August 15 was observed nationwide, while Raksha Bandhan (August 9) and Janmashtami (August 16) were regional holidays. Schools in Kerala are also set to close during Onam celebrations from August 26 to 28, coinciding with Ganesh Chaturthi.For students and parents, these holidays not only provide cultural immersion but also offer a pause in busy academic calendars. Whether schools will remain closed on August 27 depends largely on regional observance and state-level announcements.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future.

Non-engineers now almost equal to engineers in elite B-schools: What’s breaking the ‘engineering dominance’ in management?
India’s elite B-schools are witnessing a paradigm shift: engineers no longer dominate MBA classrooms. Non-engineers—economists, commerce graduates, and humanities students—are now matching or surpassing their peers in institutes like IIM Ahmedabad, Lucknow, and Indore. Changing corporate demands, revamped admission policies, and rising aspirations among non-engineers are driving this transformation, signaling the end of engineering monopoly in management education.

Non-engineers—economists, commerce graduates, and humanities students—are now matching or surpassing their peers in institutes like IIM Ahmedabad, Lucknow, and Indore. Changing corporate demands, revamped admission policies, and rising aspirations among non-engineers are driving this transformation, signaling the end of engineering monopoly in management education. Indian Institute of Management campus in Indore. Engineering and Management were often considered intertwined courses. Henceforth, the elite B-schools such as IIMs have long cherished the major footfall of engineers. The engineers reigned supreme in management classrooms for years; their numerical dominance was entrenched in the system, and non-engineers often seemed like outliers. However, the picture is changing now. The monopoly of engineers on management schools is breaking. Today’s classrooms are seeing a surge in the participation of economists, accountants, and students hailing from commerce and humanities backgrounds. Their strengths are rising and nearly matching their engineering peers in elite MBA programmes. The statistics are unambiguous. At IIM-Indore, non-engineers now account for 55% of the 2025–27 batch. IIM-Lucknow follows with just under 53%, and IIM-Ahmedabad has reached 50%, up sharply from 33% in just three years, the TNN reports suggest.While numbers depict the situation, the question that arises is: What factors are leading to a change in history and shattering the stronghold of engineering dominance?The anatomy of changeThe rise of non-engineers in India’s premier B-schools is not a coincidence; it is the result of deep structural shifts both in the pipeline of applicants and in the demands of management education.Corporate demand for new skill setsThe 21st-century corporate world is not simply asking for number-crunchers; it wants managers who can communicate, collaborate, and create. Recruiters increasingly value critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and creativity, areas where non-engineers, trained in economics, commerce, and the humanities, often hold a natural edge.With the rise of the demands of these skills, the non-engineers are flooding to B-schools to fill in the skill gap.Conscious academic design by B-schoolsIt is not a coincidence or an accident. The top B-schools have consciously and deliberately restructured their admission architecture to foster and promote diversity. At IIM-Ahmedabad, director Bharat Bhasker told TNN, “The institute began introducing academic categories about a decade ago to ensure diversity. An increase in applications from non-engineers has led to a healthy balance in classrooms.”The idea is clear: A classroom that reflects multiple academic backgrounds generates richer discussions and produces leaders who are versatile, not one-dimensional.Rising aspirations of non-engineersFor long, management was perceived as the “natural next step” for engineers. But today, students from commerce, economics, and arts are seeing B-schools as their own turf, not someone else’s. At IIM-Lucknow, for instance, 268 of 507 students in the latest MBA cohort come from non-engineering backgrounds. Director M.P. Gupta told TNN, “Commerce-related courses have attracted the most students.”The fact that commerce graduates are entering B-schools in record numbers shows a generational shift in how non-engineers view management as a career accelerator.Changing nature of business problemsWith the nature of work, the problems that businesses are facing are also altering their face. It is not solved by quantitative models alone. Whether it is managing global supply chain disruptions, navigating ESG mandates, or leading diverse teams, the need for soft skills, cultural literacy, and systems thinking is paramount. B-schools are, in effect, mirroring this reality in their selection processes.A gender dimensionThe rise of non-engineers also overlaps with the growing presence of women in B-schools. At IIM-Indore’s 2025–27 batch, of the 270 non-engineers admitted, 179 are women. Director of IIM Indore, Himanshu Rai said to TNN that, “At IIM-Indore, representation of non-engineers has risen steadily over five years.” Diversity in background is, in many cases, also translating into diversity in gender.The end of an era, and the dawn of balanceThis is not a data representation or mere statistics, but it implies toward major structural reordering of India’s B-schools. The engineering dominance in management classes is crumbling. It is getting substituted by a near-equal balance that brings forth pluralism and intellectual richness into classrooms.The engineer may no longer be the default face of India’s B-schools. The future belongs to a balanced mix, and therein lies the strength of the next generation of Indian management leaders.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future.

Studies reveal that 3D instruction enhances learning speed, attention and cognitive engagement. Integrating physical models, AR/VR, sketching and project-based learning can foster spatial reasoning, preparing students for complex, innovative careers by moving beyond surface-level understanding. Unlocking the power of 3D thinking in education: Enhancing spatial reasoning skills (Image: Pexels) Education is increasingly becoming digitised where content is delivered via screens and students are often left interacting with two-dimensional representations of complicated, three-dimensional realities. Although static images, videos and PDFs can provide fundamental information, they rarely capture the nuance, scale or spatial relationships that many subjects require. Encouraging students to “think in 3D” is more than a metaphor, it is an essential educational shift that enables students to engage with the real world more deeply, solve problems creatively and develop spatial awareness, a skill often overlooked in traditional classrooms.A 2011 independent study conducted by Texas Instruments showed that 3D instruction was not just faster but also led to greater attention and deeper cognitive engagement. The large-scale study was conducted across 15 schools by 47 teachers in Europe where students aged 10–13 were taught scientific concepts using either traditional 2D methods or immersive 3D visual aids. Professor Anne Bamford noted, “Across all of the schools involved in the study, 3D shortened the time it took for students to learn concepts, increased their attention spans and resulted in overall deeper thinking from the students.” However, the study noted potential downsides as well that included discomfort from prolonged 3D viewing and inaccessibility for students who are stereo-blind.What does "thinking in 3D" really mean?Thinking in 3D means mentally visualising, manipulating and understanding objects or ideas in a physical space. It is a critical component of fields such as:STEM disciplines: Visualising molecules in chemistry, anatomical structures in biology or force vectors in physics.Engineering and design: Drafting, prototyping and problem-solving.Architecture and urban planning: Imagining spatial relationships and human movement through built environments.Art and media: Constructing visual scenes, installations or cinematic framing.Beyond the technical aspects, 3D thinking enables students to break free from linear problem-solving and start seeing how systems interconnect in space and function. 3D thinking is not just for science and math. Spatial and multidimensional thinking can also benefit:History: Reconstructing ancient cities or exploring the movement of civilisations.Literature: Visualising narrative structure or mapping character relationships.Geography: Understanding topography, elevation and climate systems.The limits of textbooks and screensAre traditional educational methods failing students? The case for 3D thinking (Image: Pexels)A recent August 2025 study by Cornell University implemented a three-week VR course that was designed to teach spatial reasoning to undergraduate STEM students. In comparison to the traditional, more time-intensive pencil-and-paper methods, the VR approach delivered comparable gains in spatial ability and demonstrated VR's efficiency and potential as a learning tool. Additionally, students reported enjoyment and lower-than-typical cybersickness. Although textbooks and digital learning platforms are essential resources, which deliver flat content through diagrams, descriptions and formulas that help students memorise and recall, they often fail to help them understand concepts.Some key limitations include:Lack of scale: A student may know the solar system’s planets but not how vastly they differ in their sizes and distances.No tactile feedback: Manipulating objects physically strengthens memory and understanding.Linear pathways: Many digital resources lead students down one path, rather than allowing for exploration or perspective shifts.These constraints can lead to a surface-level understanding where students can recite facts but may struggle to apply them flexibly.Why spatial thinking matters in educationResearch shows a strong link between spatial reasoning and future success in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). A 2013 study published in Psychological Science found that early spatial skills can predict achievement in STEM fields better than math or verbal scores.Is 3D thinking the key to revolutionising education and spatial understanding? (Image: Pexels)Spatial thinking helps students visualise complicated systems or changes over time, understand physical cause and effect, solve problems from different angles and transfer knowledge between domains. Educators who emphasize spatial reasoning are not only helping students pass exams but also build minds that are ready for real-world innovation.Strategies for teaching 3D thinking1. Use Physical Models: Incorporate 3D models in science classes (e.g., the DNA helix, anatomy models) and let students build structures with blocks, clay, or 3D puzzles to explore form and function. It works because handling a DNA model, clay structure, or 3D puzzle activates sensory and motor pathways, making spatial relationships intuitive and memorable. Many studies root this strategy in embodied cognition, which emphasizes learning through physical interaction. For example, learning with manipulatives or objects that you can physically manipulate supports problem-solving and deeper cognitive processing. It aligns with theory and practice in embodied design, where tactile experiences facilitate understanding and exploration through gesture and motion. 2. Integrate Augmented and Virtual Reality: Use AR apps to place digital 3D models in the classroom and offer virtual tours for example, inside a volcano or around the International Space Station. AR enhances spatial learning and motivation or so Systematic Review of the Development of Spatial Intelligence through Augmented Reality in STEM Knowledge Areas, a systematic review of 17 STEM-focused studies, found. It established that AR significantly boosts understanding of visually complex content, learning outcomes (especially in areas like descriptive geometry and stereochemistry) and motivation and proactive engagement (particularly in students with lower baseline spatial skills).3. Encourage Drawing and Sketching: Make students draw systems from multiple angles for example, a plant’s root system or a cross-section of a heart as sketching enhances memory and spatial understanding. An engineering education study, The Role of Spatial Skills and Sketching in Engineering Design Problem Solving, found a strong positive correlation between students' spatial visualisation ability and the clarity of their freehand sketches. In other words, students with better spatial skills created superior drawings and vice versa. Hence, encouraging sketching of 3D systems from multiple angles helps students internalise spatial relationships visually and cognitively.4. Project-Based Learning: Ask students to design a bridge, map a city or build a simple machine to encourage real-world application and testing of their designs. The principles of embodied cognition and embodied design support the idea that hands-on building tasks engage deep spatial reasoning. Problem-solving with tangible tools links thinking to physical model manipulation, supporting metacognitive reflection on process and design.5. Teach Metacognitive Skills: Help students become aware of their own learning processes. Ask: “Can you picture it in your mind?” or “How would this look if we changed the scale?” According to research article, Fostering spatial abilities of middle school students through augmented reality: Spatial strategies, learners often develop and adapt their own spatial strategies when reflecting on tasks and this is evidence that metacognitive framing enhances spatial understanding. Hence, prompting students to visualise or mentally scale objects (“Can you picture it?”) nurtures awareness of spatial reasoning strategies and fosters flexible thinking.Teaching in 3D encourages students to go deeper and broader, returns learning to the senses and invites curiosity, exploration and creative failure. In a world saturated with fast, flat content, students who can think beyond the screen and can mentally walk around a problem, will be those who innovate. 3D thinking becomes an advantage and a necessity as we prepare students for careers that do not yet exist in industries defined by complexity and creativity. Let us move beyond surface-level engagement and help students see, touch, imagine and build their way into deeper understanding. Education must embrace dimensionality because real thinking, like the world itself, happens in more than two dimensions.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future.

Science suggests brief exposures alter learning, memory and knowledge application. A University of Sydney study shows even 5-minute breaks restore focus. Neuroscience indicates spaced repetition aids memory. Research confirms micro-breaks improve well-being and performance. Experts highlight micro-learning's efficiency; suggest intense study creates neural pathways. Here's the secret to learning anything faster in just 5 minutes (Image: iStock) In an era of short attention spans and an abundance of distractions, the notion of studying for hours on end seems outdated. In comes the idea of micro-learning: absorbing knowledge in five-minute segments. Although this may seem insignificant, science suggests those brief exposures can alter the way we learn, remember and apply knowledge.We picture learning as long, quiet hours hunched over a desk but science tells us another story. The brain does not grow in long marathon sessions — it grows best in small, quick bursts. Those small bursts of focussed effort repeated regularly can often accomplish more than an hour of distracted reading. This approach uses what psychologists refer to as 'micro-learning', a delivery method that makes knowledge available in small compartments. It operates like mental espresso — short, strong and re-energising. We learn more when we are alert and engaged and using a five-minute focused burst makes it much easier to own that focus.5 minutes a day could make you smarter than your classmates: Here’s howAccording to a 2023 study, 5-minute brain break: refresh your mind (anywhere) by University of Sydney, even a simple 5-minute “brain break” effectively restores focus and learning efficiency. In this study, students engaged in complex mental math to deplete attention. Afterwards, some either took a 5-minute unstructured rest, watched a short nature video or continued without a break. Those who rested, whether passively or virtually immersed in nature, demonstrated significantly better attention and outperformed the no‑rest group on subsequent problem-solving tasks.Study smarter, not longer: Neuroscience says this tiny habit works (Image: Pexels)Neuroscience suggests that our brains register information best when the learning is enacted with spacing and repetition. The hippocampus (the area of the brain responsible for memories) favours novelty and experiences that are brief and have focused engagement. When we use a five-minute burst to study, we are activating the brain's alertness system and synaptic activity without producing cognitive overload. Moreover, our experiences of consuming information for a long period produced diminishing returns, a lack of attention, and a poorer ability to memorise.In an interaction with TOI Education, Mamta Jani, Founder of Ontrack Education, explained, "Micro-moments take advantage of the optimum interval of focus, where every minute counts. Beyond effectiveness, micro-learning also capitalises on the natural curiosity rhythm of our brains. The moment the learner learns that they will only spend five minutes, all psychological resistance disappears, and the mind engages with the short ‘experiment’ rather than a fear-inducing task to accomplish. It can turn an uninteresting topic into a compelling challenge: 'I can look up quantum physics for five minutes,' or 'I can drill my vocabulary for five minutes,' or 'I can do a short programming task.' The transition from micro-moment to larger blocks of expertise is gradual but impactful—like the tiny raindrops that turn into a river."A research paper, "Give me a break!" A systematic review and meta-analysis on the efficacy of micro-breaks for increasing well-being and performance, evaluated short micro-breaks (< 10 min) across multiple tasks. Findings indicate:Well-being: Micro-breaks consistently preserve vigour and reduce fatigue.Performance: Especially beneficial for clerical or creative tasks, though results vary with task type. Longer breaks tended to offer greater performance gainsIt established that even brief pauses under 10 minutes reliably improve subjective energy and performance in many contexts.Forget all-nighters: This study hack takes less than a coffee breakMicro-moments, in addition to the other reasons for their effectiveness, get us to retrieval practice, which is a critical factor noted in cognitive science. When we review and test learning in less than set intervals, we activate memory pathways more effectively than through continuous reading or cramming for a long time before an exam. Different learning tools like apps, flashcards, or sticky notes can convert normal during-wait time periods— i.e., commuting, standing in a queue, or during a coffee break — into many different opportunities for the better use of these basic moments of the day. What starts as an insignificant value with a single micro-moment can grow into an effective learning process that is created and formed through habit, done multiple times during the day. As well, micro-learning makes sense with the structure and functioning of artificial intelligence.Jani elaborated, "Algorithms process information in highly rapid cycles to query and store data and recall it. In the same way, micro-learning supports cognitive development at the human level as it allows for processing specifications, data and tactical knowledge of critical, applied information in short, small bits of practical, actionable information. For this reason, and many more, micro-moments are both winner-winner and future-orientated. prepare our cognitive ability for a context that values agility and adaptability more than precise recall of information learnt verbatim. Lastly, there is a deep time element of integration and reflection associated with these microbursts. Instead of studying for five minutes in an isolated short duration, you may be prompted to ask questions, make connections, or have creative considerations that have been routinely lost in longer, more artificial sessions that are forced."Here's how to sneak learning into your day without even tryingThe micro-moment exercises have a value of fostering an orientation of curiosity and objective learning that is continuous, spontaneous, and free of obligations. Essentially, learning in micro-moments is the opposite of what we have been taught to expect: depth doesn't always have to require a period. A series of 5-minute activities allows us to take advantage of our brain's natural cycles, convert dead time into active engagement, and promote an ongoing curiosity throughout our lives. In a world of distractions, seeking small amounts of focused learning may be the most potent approach we can take.Boost your brainpower while boiling water, no jokeThe science lies in how memory forms. Bringing his expertise to the same, Manish Mohta, Founder of Learning Spiral, advised, "Short periods of intense study create fresh neural pathways without overloading them. These pathways strengthen during rest intervals, meaning that the real learning takes place after the study has finished. Learning often occurs best after an intense five-minute session and resting or changing activity. The brain wasn't allowed to associate the information before it was fatigued and the time effect was over."Micro-moments also align nicely with our ongoing practice in our lives. Waiting for the kettle to boil can become a quick review of a key definition. A bus ride can be used to solve a short practice problem. Mohta further suggested -Before bed, a learner can summarise one main idea from the day. These small windows, used consistently, accumulate into hours of meaningful study without blocking out large portions of the day. This method benefits from the ‘spacing effect’, a well-documented phenomenon where information is better retained when revisited at intervals. You can study a topic for five minutes today, then two days later, then next week. Each time you revisit the topic, it will reinforce your memories of it, adding another layer, like adding coats of varnish to wood. The secret is to keep each session sharply focused. One small goal could be understanding a formula, remembering a date, or to learn perhaps 3 words.He pointed out, "The full five minutes are complete focus and uninterrupted focus. No distractions, nothing else taking your attention, pure focus. At the end of some time, it is then simply left for the brain to allow consolidation before the next focus period."In an information-heavy world, micro-moments make fragmented time valuable learning moments. Learning is about attention and logic and less about seat time. Even in the smallest fragments of time, the return can be massive. The very notion of mastery is achieved in conscious moments in time. Five focused minutes can shape a lifetime of understanding and intellectual assurance.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future.

The initiative aims to improve access to Class 11–12 education in rural and semi-urban areas, reduce dropout rates, and strengthen public schools amid declining enrollment, with an estimated expenditure of Rs 29.39 crore.  Chennai, India: The Department of School Education has announced plans to upgrade 20 government high schools across Tamil Nadu into higher secondary schools for the 2025–26 academic year.The initiative, aimed at expanding access to higher secondary education, follows a budget announcement earlier this year by School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi.As part of the upgradation process, 200 postgraduate teachers will be appointed, with ten teachers assigned to each school. Subject-wise allocations include Tamil, English, physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, history, economics, computer science, and commerce.Teachers will be recruited under the pay scale of Rs 36,900–1,16,600 (Level-18), with the state government approving an estimated expenditure of Rs 29.39 crore for the project.Among the schools identified for upgradation is Mathur Government High School in Chennai’s Madhavaram block. Other districts benefiting include Cuddalore, Kallakurichi, Krishnagiri, Chengalpattu, Dindigul, Tiruchy, Tirupattur, Madurai, Villupuram, Ramanathapuram, Tiruppur, Salem, Tiruvannamalai, Nagapattinam, and Kanniyakumari.Officials said the initiative aims to ensure students in rural and semi-urban areas can continue studies up to Class 12 without shifting schools or discontinuing education.“It is about time certain high schools are upgraded. This will help reduce dropout rates and encourage students to pursue higher education within their localities,” a government school teacher said.However, the development comes amid challenges in the state’s education system, with declining enrollment in several schools. The Department of Elementary Education (DEE) recently closed 208 state-run schools due to zero admissions. Overall, 1,204 schools across Tamil Nadu recorded no new enrollments this academic year, including 208 government primary and middle schools, 114 government-aided schools, 11 partially-funded schools, 869 private institutions, and two union government schools.Officials hope that upgrading high schools to higher secondary will strengthen the public school system and restore confidence among parents and communities in state-run institutions.

SC declines to hear Sanjay Singh’s plea against merger of 105 UP primary schools
The Supreme Court on Monday refused to entertain AAP MP Sanjay Singh’s plea against the Uttar Pradesh government’s decision to merge 105 primary schools, asking him to approach the Allahabad High Court instead. Singh argued the move was arbitrary, violated children’s right to education under Article 21A and the RTE Act, and forced longer travel without transport facilities.

Singh argued the move was arbitrary, violated children’s right to education under Article 21A and the RTE Act, and forced longer travel without transport facilities.  New Delhi, India: The Supreme Court on Monday refused to entertain a plea filed by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh challenging the Uttar Pradesh government’s decision to pair and merge 105 government-run primary schools.“Are you not trying to enforce rights under the Right to Education Act? If it is a statutory right, then it cannot be camouflaged as a writ petition under Article 32 (dealing with enforcement of fundamental rights)! Let the Allahabad High Court decide the matter,” a Bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and A.G. Masih remarked at the outset.Sensing the Bench’s reluctance to hear the matter, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Singh, sought permission to withdraw the plea with liberty to approach the Allahabad High Court. The apex court then dismissed the matter as withdrawn.Singh’s petition had argued that the government’s decision, formalised through a June 16 order and a June 24 list, was “arbitrary, unconstitutional, and legally impermissible.”It said the merger of schools with low enrolment had adversely affected access to education, forcing children to travel longer distances without transportation or other facilities. This, the plea contended, violated the right to free and compulsory education under Article 21A and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 (RTE Act).Citing Rule 4 of the Uttar Pradesh RTE Rules, 2011, the petition stressed that primary schools must be located “within one kilometre of a child’s residence, particularly in habitations with a population of not less than 300 persons.”“The state government cannot discharge its duty merely by showing that another school exists somewhere in the vicinity. If the school is beyond 1 km, it violates Rule 4(1)(a) unless the exceptions under Rule 4(2) are met — which they are not,” the plea stated.It further argued that any policy or executive action compelling children to travel unreasonable distances to attend school — such as closures or mergers — is prima facie unconstitutional and contrary to Article 21A and the RTE Act.The petition also cited the Mohini Jain vs State of Karnataka and Unnikrishnan, J.P. vs State of Andhra Pradesh judgments, which affirmed the right to education as flowing from the right to life and dignity, and as a fundamental right up to the age of 14.

With a political career spanning over four decades, he has served as Lok Sabha MP, state BJP president, and governor of Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Telangana, and Puducherry. His extensive experience in governance and party organisation has positioned him as a key contender for the vice presidency scheduled for September 9. CP Radhakrishnan educational qualification and political career: From Tamil Nadu BJP leader to Maharashtra governor and NDA vice-presidential candidate Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader CP Radhakrishnan has been named as the National Democratic Alliance's (NDA) candidate for the upcoming vice-presidential election. The announcement came after the resignation of Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar, with the election scheduled to take place on September 9. Radhakrishnan currently serves as the Governor of Maharashtra and holds additional responsibilities as Governor of Telangana and Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry.This appointment marks a significant milestone in Radhakrishnan's over four-decade-long political career, which began with his association with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Bharatiya Janata Party in Tamil Nadu. His educational background and diverse political experience have played key roles in his rise to prominent positions within Indian politics.Early life and educational qualificationChandrapuram Ponnusamy Radhakrishnan was born in Tiruppur, Tamil Nadu, into the Kongu Vellalar Gounder community. He holds a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) degree from V. O. Chidambaram College in Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu. Alongside his academic pursuits, he was a college-level table tennis champion, showcasing a diverse range of interests from an early age.From the age of 17, Radhakrishnan was actively involved with the RSS and Bharatiya Jana Sangh. His formal entry into politics came with his election to the Jan Sangh's state executive committee in 1974, laying the foundation for his long political journey.Political career in Tamil Nadu and Lok SabhaRadhakrishnan first rose to national prominence as a two-time Member of Parliament (MP) representing Coimbatore in the Lok Sabha, winning elections in 1998 and 1999. His 1998 election was notable as he was one of three BJP candidates to win in Tamil Nadu following the party's alliance with the AIADMK, an important achievement in the state's political landscape. During his tenure, he served as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Textiles and was a member of committees on Public Sector Undertakings and Finance.He was also part of the Indian parliamentary delegation to the United Nations General Assembly in 2004, where he addressed humanitarian and disaster relief coordination. His political career in Tamil Nadu further advanced when he became the BJP state president from 2004 to 2007. During this period, he undertook a 93-day, 19,000-kilometre 'Ratha Yatra', advocating various social and environmental causes across the state.Governorship and administrative rolesIn 2016, Radhakrishnan was appointed Chairman of the Coir Board, under the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, where he oversaw record exports valued at Rs 2,532 crore. He later served as BJP's all-India in-charge for Kerala from 2020 to 2022, contributing to the party's organisational efforts in the state.In February 2023, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appointed Radhakrishnan as the Governor of Jharkhand. Within his first four months in office, he visited all 24 districts to engage with local officials and citizens. In July 2024, he assumed office as Governor of Maharashtra. Around the same time, he was given additional responsibilities as Governor of Telangana and Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry, roles he held until July 2024 before handing over to successors.NDA's vice-presidential candidateFollowing the resignation of Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar citing health reasons, BJP national president JP Nadda announced CP Radhakrishnan's candidacy for the vice-presidential election. Radhakrishnan's vast experience in politics and governance, combined with his organisational background and administrative roles as governor, positions him as a seasoned candidate for the post.The vice-presidential election will be held on September 9, with the last date for filing nominations on August 21 and withdrawal by August 25. Radhakrishnan's selection reflects the NDA's strategy to field a leader with strong organisational roots and experience in both legislative and administrative spheres.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

The mistake was flagged by teachers and quickly removed, prompting an internal inquiry. The controversy sparked criticism from the ABVP, accusing the Kerala government of distorting history and undermining national unity. Complaints have been filed demanding strict action and better oversight of educational materials. Kerala's SCERT removes error on Netaji Bose amid ABVP protests and historical dispute Kerala's State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) recently corrected a factual error in a Class 4 teachers' handbook that stated Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose 'fled to Germany, fearing the British' before forming the Indian National Army (INA). The mistake, which misrepresented the freedom fighter's role, was flagged by teachers soon after the handbook's release and subsequently rectified by SCERT.The handbook, designed to assist educators in following the state syllabus, originally contained a brief note on Bose's political journey, including his tenure as Congress president and the founding of the Forward Bloc. However, the incorrect phrase suggesting he fled out of fear was removed following swift feedback from teachers, according to an official statement cited by local media.Error spotted and corrected following teacher feedbackThe SCERT handbook was intended to provide accurate background information and teaching instructions for Class 4 Environmental Studies. Upon receiving the teachers' feedback, SCERT immediately recalled the handbook and issued a revised version, assuring parents and educators of improved quality control in future publications.An official confirmed to media outlets that an internal inquiry has been launched to determine how the error bypassed the review process. The statement read that "more rigorous quality checks will be enforced going forward to avoid such errors," as reported by the press.Political reactions and accusations of distorted historyThe controversy attracted sharp criticism from the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), which accused the CPI(M)-led Kerala government of deliberately spreading distorted historical narratives through textbooks and handbooks. The student organisation claimed the erroneous description of Netaji was "fake propaganda" intended to defame a national hero who sacrificed his life for India's independence.ABVP National Secretary Shravan B. Raj alleged that portraying Netaji as a coward was a "malicious lie." He also pointed out other serious errors in the same textbook, such as the omission of Assam and Jharkhand from the map of India, which the ABVP described as part of a larger conspiracy to undermine national unity. Raj stated, as quoted by the media, that the ruling party's actions were "a calculated attempt by the Communist Party-led Kerala government to manipulate the young generation with fake narratives."Concerns over educational content and national integrityE.U. Eswaraprasad, ABVP Kerala State Secretary, highlighted that the incident revealed a "poisonous narrative" promoted by the Education Department. He criticised Kerala's claim of being a model state, calling the error a "heinous act" and "a deliberate ploy" to implant anti-national ideas among students. Eswaraprasad said the ABVP had submitted formal complaints to the state Education Minister and the Director of NCERT, demanding strict action against officials responsible, according to press reports.The ABVP also vowed to launch protests if corrective measures were not implemented promptly. The controversy over the historical error in the SCERT handbook has therefore escalated into a larger debate over the politicisation of academic content and the safeguarding of accurate historical knowledge in school curricula.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

However, boosted by Independence Day, day 2 collections surged to ₹56.50 crore, crossing ₹100 crore in all languages. While the Hindi version rebounded strongly, the Telugu version saw a significant drop over the weekend, with total collections reaching ₹175.  'War 2' released in theatres on August 14, a day before Independence day and clashed at the box office with 'Coolie'. While it's one of the biggest clashes of movies, it's also a long three-day weekend which may end up in the favour of both the movies. While on the first day, 'War 2' was behind 'Coolie' as both the movies made Rs 51.5 crore and Rs 65 crore respectively. However, on day 2 which is Independence Day, 'War 2' performed better. Over the weekend the film has remained decent with more than Rs 30 crore each on Saturday and Sunday. War 2 Movie ReviewDespite lukewarm critical reviews and a mixed response from audiences online, the film’s second-day performance has been impressive. According to Sacnilk, the day 2 collection of the film which saw growth due to Independence day, is Rs 56.50 crore. Thus, it has crossed the Rs 100 crore mark within two days in all languages, according to Sacnilk. 'War 2' has released in Hindi, Telugu and Tamil. The Telugu version of the film also got a great response due to Jr NTR's presence but on day 2 there was growth in the Hindi belt. The spike was fueled by stronger occupancies in key metros and robust evening-to-night show numbers. The holiday effect in certain territories, coupled with steady single-screen turnout in mass markets, also played a big role in the Hindi version’s rebound.'War 2' review: Stylish spy thriller with Hrithik–Jr NTR chemistry divides fans over story and VFXOn Saturday, the film made Rs 33 crore of which the Hindi version made Rs 26 crore. There was a huge drop in the collections of the Telugu version of the film. While the Telugu version made Rs 22.75 crore on Day 1, the number dropped to Rs 12.5 crore on Day 2 and more down to 50 percent of that on day 3. On Sunday, the total collection of 'War 2' in all languages was Rs 31.3 crore which was a drop from the Saturday numbers.

Ameesha Patel, a true South Bombay girl, has an impressive collection of nearly 400 luxury bags, including Birkin and Bottega Veneta pieces worth crores. Filmmaker Farah Khan toured her collection, admiring its rarity and value, while Ameesha joked about her expensive hobby costing her a Mumbai penthouse. Before making her debut in ‘Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai’, Ameesha Patel was already known as a true South Bombay girl, a fact reflected in her impressive handbag collection. Coming from a family with strong roots in business and politics, she began amassing designer bags at just 12 years old. Today, her collection boasts nearly 400 bags, each valued in lakhs of rupees. Recently, filmmaker and choreographer Farah Khan toured Ameesha’s home and shared a sneak peek of this stunning assortment.Farah Khan is amazed by Ameesha’s extensive collectionAt the start of the vlog, Farah expressed her amazement, saying, “I have never seen Ameesha repeat her bag. She must have the maximum number of designer bags in the industry.” Ameesha then shared that her collection includes around 300 to 400 luxury bags, in addition to several clutches and belt bags. Alongside handbags, she is also passionate about collecting luxury watches.Ameesha Patel Returns: Casual Look, Classic Charm In JuhuBirkin bags are stored in an organized cupboardFarah indicated a cupboard and remarked, “This cupboard is filled with Ameesha’s Birkin bags.” Considered one of the most prestigious brands globally, a Birkin bag can be priced as high as Rs 2-3 crore.Detailed inventory keeps track of her collectionInside the cupboard, the actor has neatly placed a detailed list that organizes the bags by each shelf. One section of the list reads: “Shelf 7: Hermes Yellow Evelyn, Hermes Baby Pink Evelyn, Hermes Fuschia Pink Evelyn, Hermes Orange Evelyn, Hermes Powder Blue Evelyn, Hermes Mini Red Evelyn, Hermes Mini White Evelyn, Dior Denim Saddle Bag, Fendi Phone Case, LV Phone Case.”Saint Laurent bag captivates Farah KhanThe actress carefully took out a Saint Laurent bag from its protective cover to show Farah. Seeing it, the filmmaker was visibly impressed and sighed, “This is a bag I have wanted for so long ever and ever but it is…” before making a facial expression that hinted it was beyond her budget.Rare Bottega Veneta bags steal the spotlightNext, they chose a bag from Bottega Veneta. As Farah unwrapped it, she told the viewers, “This is one of the most expensive brands in the world: Bottega Veneta.” She revealed an orange bag, commenting, “This is a rare one I am seeing.” Ameesha chimed in, “This is a little traditional colour.” Farah agreed, “Yeah, exactly why I have never even seen it.” Then Ameesha showcased another bag from the same brand and style in black, saying, “This is a little classic, this is Black.” With a smile, Ameesha joked, “If I didn’t have a habit of collecting bags, I would have been owning a penthouse in Mumbai,” referring to the high value of her collection.Playful banter about marriage and bagsNext, she revealed another bag from Bottega Veneta. Farah couldn’t help but joke, “I think you should marry Karan Johar.” Ameesha responded, “I think so too. We want to be single so it is an ideal relationship.” As Ameesha displayed her Andiamo Large Tote, Farah admired it as “gorgeous” and teased, “Don’t show this to Dilip, he will simply use it to buy vegetables.” Ameesha then laughed, explaining how people often poke fun at her for carrying such big bags. “They say, ‘These bags are bigger and heavier than you, so you use them for veggies only,’” she shared. Farah agreed, “This is very heavy.” Ameesha added, “Yeah, and it gets heavier when I add stuff in it.” The price tag on this bag is upwards of ₹5,80,000."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

While some express concern over his drastically different appearance, others praise his dedication to fitness. Singh humorously addressed the concerns, attributing his transformation to hard work, while his trainer revealed details of his intense regime.  Rapper-singer Honey Singh has undergone a major physical transformation, but it has also left fans divided. His fitness trainer Arun Kumar recently revealed that the artist shed 17 kilos in just a month through a strict workout plan and diet. However, Singh’s latest pictures triggered concern among followers, with many pointing out that he looks drastically different.One Instagram user even shared a video comparing Honey’s glamorous looks from the past two years with his present-day appearance. The fan wrote, “I don’t know why no one has noticed it yet, but something has happened to Honey Singh. For the past two years, he was looking so glamorous, but in some of his recent posts and stories, it seems like something has happened to his nose. Honey Singh goes to the gym every day, but his body seems to be shrinking. I feel like something has happened again in his life that he isn’t telling anyone about.”Music Scandal Erupts! Honey Singh & Karan Aujla in HOT WATER Over ‘Offensive’ LyricsNot the one to shy away from humour, Honey responded in style: “Kuch nahi hua manhoos (Nothing happened, unlucky one 😂). I am working out hard for glorious days.” His quirky reply instantly won the internet. Fans praised his wit with comments like, “Kya jawab diya hai (What an answer),” and “Bomb paaji, good reply.” Another cheekily remarked, “You look much better than Badshah.”Honey Singh's trainer had spoken about his fitness regime in a conversation with Aaj Tak and revealed details behind Honey’s dramatic weight loss journey. According to him, the singer went from 95 kg to 77 kg in a month by following a meticulously designed meal plan, intense training, and a special green metabolism-boosting juice. He clarified that Singh’s diet was completely natural, with around 60 grams of protein daily from sources like chicken and vegetables."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

'Coolie' suffered from a weak screenplay and recycled tropes, while 'War 2' lacked a gripping emotional core. The clash highlighted the importance of storytelling over hype, leaving both films bruised at the box office. Rajinikanth's 'Coolie' and Hrithik Roshan's 'War 2' faced off, but both films underperformed despite strong openings. 'Coolie' suffered from a weak screenplay and recycled tropes, while 'War 2' lacked a gripping emotional core. The clash highlighted the importance of storytelling over hype, leaving both films bruised at the box office. When the release dates of Rajinikanth’s Coolie and Hrithik Roshan’s War 2 were locked for the same extended weekend, trade analysts, exhibitors, and fans braced themselves for what was billed as the “clash of the year.” The two films carried enormous weight on their shoulders: Coolie promised to be another mass masala entertainer led by the Rajinikanth himself collaborating with hit machine Lokesh Kanagaraj while War 2 was touted as Bollywood’s big-ticket spy-universe spectacle headlined by Hrithik Roshan with Jr NTR joining him to provide the south push.Yet, four days after their release, the numbers tell a different story. Both films have managed strong openings but are nowhere near the benchmarks their makers and fans had hoped for. The Numbers So FarIn India, Coolie collected Rs 65 crore on Day 1 (Thursday), primarily driven by Tamil Nadu and Telugu markets. Day 2 dropped to Rs 54.75 crore, followed by Rs 39.5 crore on Saturday and Rs 35 crore on Sunday. That brings its four-day total to aroundRs 194.25 crore net across languages.PollWhich film do you think had a stronger opening at the box office?CoolieWar 2War 2, on the other hand, opened lower with Rs 52 crore on Day 1. It managed to inch higher on Day 2 with Rs 57.35 crore, before sliding sharply to Rs 33.25 crore on Saturday andRs 31 crore (early estimates) on Sunday. Its four-day total stands atRs 173.6 crore net across languages with Hindi version contributing over Rs 125 crore.Overseas, the story isn’t drastically different. In North America, Coolie minted around USD 6 million in four days, while War 2 collected USD 3 million. For two films that were marketed as pan-India and global tentpoles, these numbers, while healthy in isolation, do not reflect the earth-shattering dominance one would expect from such heavyweight titles.The real problem both films face isn’t the clash , it is the content itself.Rajinikanth’s Coolie was designed as a throwback to the larger-than-life masala entertainers that made him a superstar. The trailers promised punch dialogues, exaggerated action, and whistle-worthy swagger. The first day’s collections indicated that fans turned out in droves.But as the weekend wore on, the word of mouth began to dip. Audiences complained about a weak screenplay, recycled tropes, and lack of emotional depth. Rajinikanth’s charisma remained intact, but the film offered little beyond his screen presence. Younger audiences, especially in metros, found the film dated, while family audiences felt the emotional core was missing.On the other hand, War 2 had the baggage of carrying forward the Spy Universe after Pathaan and Tiger. Expectations were sky-high, especially with Hrithik Roshan reprising his Kabir role and NTR Jr joining as the antagonist. The fans called out the film for its flimsy writing, incoherent arcs,not up to the mark VFX and a predictable storyline.The problem here wasn’t the lack of spectacle but the absence of a gripping emotional anchor. The film felt like a series of set pieces stitched together rather than a cohesive narrative.When two big-ticket films release on the same day, cannibalization is inevitable. Screens get divided, shows overlap, and audiences—especially in multiplexes—are forced to choose one over the other.In this case, Coolie dominated the South Indian markets, while War 2 enjoyed better traction in North India.The Burden of ExpectationBoth films also became victims of their own hype.Coolie was marketed as Rajinikanth’s grand return after the super success of JailerThe teaser broke records, the songs trended across social media, and fan clubs went all out with promotions. But when the film delivered more of the same old formula, audiences felt shortchanged.War 2, meanwhile, was positioned as a chapter in India’s first “spy universe.” The inclusion of NTR Jr was supposed to attract Southern audiences, while Hrithik’s return was meant to fuel nationwide frenzy. However, the film’s writing simply didn’t match the monumental expectations it carried.Mixed Word of MouthAnother critical factor has been the mixed word of mouth.Coolie has strong appeal among Rajinikanth loyalists, ensuring single-screen crowds remain energetic, but urban audiences are lukewarm.War 2 is attracting footfalls for its action spectacle, but its inconsistent pacing is putting off repeat viewership.The Road AheadFor Coolie, the hope lies in South Indian markets, where Rajinikanth’s pull remains unmatched. The film may stabilize at lower levels but still post healthy lifetime numbers due to fan loyalty.For War 2, the Hindi belt will be crucial. If word of mouth steadies and the weekday drops aren’t too steep, the film can still salvage its run, though crossing Rs 300 crore net in India a figure once expected now looks improbable despite having no new films releasing till 29th August.In the end, the much-hyped Coolie vs War 2 clash has proven to be a lose-lose situation. Instead of creating fireworks at the box office, the battle has highlighted the fragility of films that lean too heavily on hype and star power while neglecting storytelling.Both Rajinikanth and Hrithik Roshan remain massive crowd-pullers, and both films will recover costs thanks to pre-sales, digital, and satellite deals. But in terms of theatrical impact, neither will go down as the historic blockbuster their makers envisioned. Sometimes, two giants colliding doesn’t create a spectacle; it simply leaves both bruised."Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Apoorva Mukhija's ex-boyfriend accuses her of cheating

Adding to the drama, ex-boyfriend Utsav Dahiya accuses Apoorva of cheating and using their relationship for content.  After the India’s Got Latent controversy settled, influencer Apoorva Mukhija found herself in the spotlight once again with her stint on Karan Johar’s reality show The Traitors. On the show, she was often discussed alongside fellow content creator Sufi Motiwala. But now, Sufi has publicly declared that he and Apoorva are no longer friends, citing her lack of support when he was targeted by trolls from her audience.In an Instagram story, Sufi clarified, “No more lies. I’ve received a lot of texts saying that I’ve taken clout from Apoorva and I’ve left her. I’ve literally never collaborated on a reel with her and have been on her YouTube twice, both of which were her content pieces entirely. So no I’m not sorry I didn’t use her for clout (incase u forgot we were on the same show without knowing each other I don’t need her clout) I wanted to be friends with Apoorva not the rebel kid when there was no accountability constantly for how I was being treated I distanced myself.”Uorfi Javed vs Apoorva Mukhija: ‘The Traitors’ Reality Show Fight Gets UGLYWhile Sufi distanced himself, Apoorva’s ex-boyfriend Utsav Dahiya also took to Instagram with a sharp takedown of the influencer. In a recent post, Utsav accused her of cheating, even sharing a song in which he called her out, alleging that she wanted to reconcile purely for “content.” He also claimed that Apoorva used the word “ghatiya” for him only to boost social media engagement.Part of his caption read: “Ab agar koi aur bakwaas kari toh main seedha receipts nikalunga. Never try to gain sympathy by fabricating lies or pushing false narratives just to make content and assassinate someone’s character online. Having a big following doesn’t give you the right to bully your way by rage-baiting your audience and unleashing them on others.”Utsav further alleged that Apoorva and her team dismissed his concerns when he was being trolled due to her accusations: “When I was being falsely painted as a cheat and an abuser because of things you said, I reached out to you and your agency, hoping to find a way to deal with the hate. Instead, I was told, ‘You’re a nobody, you should be happy you got to date her.’ So here’s a message from that ‘nobody’: you tried your level best (and I won’t lie, it wasn’t easy), but I’m still here, still standing. That should tell you something: your big numbers only matter on an app. There’s a real and much bigger world outside, beyond lies and kalesh.”He concluded by saying, "Truth doesn't need 'followers', it stands on its own. Toh tum chalao apna ghar kalesh se, but kisi ke baare mein jhoot bolna band karo. Baki logo ko life mein dhanke kaam karne do. Grow up, kid. (and here's a rhyme for you that might be more up your speed .... in case it helps)" With his caption, he sang a song dedicated to her which also hinted at their story. Apoorva and Utsav had announced their breakup earlier this year in January. Since then, she has repeatedly hinted at him in her content, accusing him of cheating and abuse without taking his name directly. In his latest post too, Utsav avoided naming her, but the message left little doubt for followers about whom he was addressing."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

They were seen on a yacht off Formentera, Spain. The couple shared a kiss and relaxed on board. They have been linked since August 2023. Earlier this summer, they attended Jeff Bezos' wedding celebrations. Ceretti spoke about the pressures of dating someone famous. The couple has kept their relationship mostly private.  Oscar-winning actor Leonardo DiCaprio, 50, and Italian model Vittoria Ceretti, 27, were spotted enjoying a romantic yacht trip off the coast of Formentera, Spain. On Friday, August 15, the pair shared a kiss while relaxing on board, giving fans a rare glimpse of their private romance. Sun, sea and a little PDAAccording to the pictures and videos published by Daily Mail, the couple clearly made the most of their Mediterranean getaway. They lounged on the yacht, took dips in the sparkling blue waters, and mingled with friends on board. At one sweet moment, Ceretti placed her hand on DiCaprio’s back as they climbed the yacht stairs together. A relaxed day in the sun turned into a picture-perfect PDA moment.Rare public appearance sparks excitementThough linked since August 2023, DiCaprio and Ceretti are rarely seen together in public. Their yacht outing gave fans a rare and intimate look at a love that has stayed mostly under wraps.Jet-setting lovebirdsThe couple seems to share a love for travel and luxury trips. Earlier this summer, they were spotted at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez’s wedding celebrations in Venice. On June 26, they were photographed leaving the Gritti Palace Hotel before the wedding welcome party. DiCaprio was effortlessly sharp in a dark suit and cap, while Ceretti looked chic in a long neutral dress with stitching details, a stylish updo, and a nude clutch bag.Ceretti opens up about high-profile loveEarlier this year, Ceretti spoke for the first time about dating someone famous in Vogue France. While she didn’t name DiCaprio directly, the magazine called him a “very, very famous actor.”The model said they first met in Milan but didn’t share more details. She also reflected on the pressures of dating in the spotlight. “As soon as you're in a relationship with someone who has a larger following than you, you become 'girlfriend of', or 'boyfriend of,' for that matter. And that can be extremely annoying,” she told Vogue France.Labels can be limitingCeretti added, “Suddenly, people are talking about you as so-and-so's girlfriend who was so-and-so's ex. So, it's not nice to think that you can't love whoever you want, because of the labels people need to stick on you.”Yet, she said love can rise above all the noise. “If what you're experiencing is real, if you know you love each other, then there's no reason to be alarmed. Because love protects and gives confidence."Since their romance became public, DiCaprio and Ceretti have kept things mostly private but have been spotted together at a few events and trips.

Despite this, she has achieved significant success, including an Ivor Novello Award, while openly addressing body image and mental health. Canal's resilience shines through her music and advocacy.  TRIGGER WARNING: This article includes references to sexual abuseVictoria Canal, a Spanish-American singer and songwriter, has courageously revealed that she was groomed and abused by a “very powerful, decades-older man” early in her career. In a heartfelt Instagram post, she shared how the abuse lasted over a year and how she was manipulated into silence, being told that speaking out would end her career before it had even begun.Victoria Canal UNMASKS ‘POWERFUL’ ABUSER; 'June Baby' Star Exposes Grooming HorrorBeyond this revelation, Canal has been open about her life and challenges. Born with a congenital condition, she refuses to be defined by it. According to a Prime Timer report, Canal was born without the lower half of her right arm. She has compared it to something as ordinary as having “an unlucky-shaped nose” and insists she does not want to be boxed as ‘the one-armed singer’ like Stevie Wonder, who is not solely defined by blindness.Her unique perspective has shaped her music. Canal learned to play piano without her right hand, developing special chord voicings and creative techniques that are central to her songwriting.Global upbringing shaped her early careerAs reported by Hindustan Times, she was born in Munich and raised across the globe. Canal often communicated online due to her family’s nomadic lifestyle. Her breakthrough came through Instagram, where short clips of her performances caught the attention of artists like Michael Franti and Emily King, who later invited her on tour.Since then, Canal has shared stages with major acts, fronted Nike’s Jordan FlyEase campaign, and in 2024, she won the prestigious Ivor Novello Award in the UK for songwriting. Her music is known for its honesty and vulnerability, exploring themes of body image, identity, and resilience.Shocking abuse allegations revealed publiclyEarlier this month, Canal revealed in an Instagram post that early in her career she was groomed and abused by a “very powerful, decades-older man” who had offered her first professional break. She described how she was manipulated into silence by the abuser, who made her believe that no one else wanted her. Canal wrote that she was told speaking about the abuse would end her career before it had even begun, according to Music Ally.Victoria said the experience, which lasted just over a year, has had a lasting effect on her intimate life. Sharing her truth, she explained, was part of her healing journey. Although she did not name her alleged abuser, speculation online suggested it could be musician Michael Franti. ETimes cannot independently verify this.Reclaiming power through honestyFor Canal, speaking openly about abuse is part of reclaiming her power, just like her previous disclosures about body image and mental health. She shared a strong message to her fans,“Whatever you look like, whatever you are feeling, you are accepted, you are enough. You are more than enough.”DISCLAIMER: If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, assault, or abuse, please seek immediate help.

Sufi revealed he cut ties because he felt Apoorva didn't address her fans' abuse towards him. He clarified he didn't use her for clout, wanting genuine friendship, not dealing with constant mistreatment without accountability.  With the way things unfolded during and after ‘The Traitors,’ it seemed like the entertainment industry was ready to find new BFFs in Sufi Motiwala and Arpoorva Mukhija. However, just when the audience was starting to cherish their bond, their friendship ended. Sufi Motiwala took to his social media handle to clear the air around their bond and say that he has cut ties with Apoorva. In his words, he wanted to be friends with Apoorva Mukhija and not Rebel Kid.Read on to know what Sufi Motiwala has to say on his broken bond with Apoorva MukhijaSufi Motiwala breaks his silence on his ‘not friends anymore’ status with Apoorva Mukhija“No more lies. I’ve received a lot of texts saying that I’ve taken clout from Apoorva, and I’ve left her. I’ve literally never collaborated on a reel with her and have been on her YouTube twice, both of which were her content pieces entirely," wrote Sufi before adding, “So no I’m not sorry I didn’t use her for clout (incase u forgot we were on the same show without knowing each other I don’t need her clout) I wanted to be friends with Apoorva not the rebel kid when there was no accountability constantly for how I was being treated I distanced myself."He shared that despite his request to Apoorva to make her fans understand not to slam him, he got no response from her. “I even requested her to ask her audience to calm down because they’ve been abusing me for no reason. Sadly, this person who called me her best friend has no concern for that, or the fact that maybe I’m hurt. THAT is why I’m not friends with her anymore. Keep it cute, keep it moving."“Idc about anything u think I’m a horrible person, ok. But I have worked my a** off to build myself to where I am, and I won’t let a bunch of children discredit that by spreading misinformation," he concluded.Sufi and Apoorva formed a strong friendship during the shoot of ‘The Traitors,’ which fans on the internet embraced. However, keen observers noted that the two have stopped mentioning each other on social media, despite attending the same events, including one in Australia. Reportedly, Sufi has unfollowed Apoorva on Instagram.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Chatterjee also mentioned his unawareness of the film's title change and director Vivek Agnihotri claimed the trailer launch was halted due to lack of permission.  'The Bengal Files,' directed by Vivek Agnihotri, has been in the news due to a controversy surrounding its historical accuracy, which reportedly led to the cancellation of its trailer launch in Kolkata. Amid the debate, actor Saswata Chatterjee has distanced himself from the film, stating he is an actor, not a historian, and is therefore not qualified to verify the story's historical claims.Read on to learn more about what the actor has to say about 'The Bengal Files.'Sawasta Chatterjee distances himself from ‘The Bengal Files’ controversyIn his recent interview with The Wall, the actor stated that he simply played a character he liked and that it is not his responsibility as an actor to verify historical accuracy. He added that if others believe the film distorts history or belittles Bengal, they should take legal action instead of just creating a fuss."I liked a character and I played it. I am not a historian to think about what history says, and this is distorting history. It's not my job. If those whose job it is feel that Bengal is being belittled, then they can go to court with the information. There is no point in just making noise," Chatterjee said. Further distancing himself from the controversy, the actor added, “Let me tell you this. Nowadays, it's a trend; the whole story won't be told to anyone. You only get to know your track, your character. And when I was told about the role, I found the character to be amazing. It's a villain's character, and very few people get such characters to play."Sawasta Chatterjee claims he had no idea about the title changeSaswata Chatterjee stated that he was unaware of the change in the film's title from 'Delhi Files' to 'The Bengal Files.' He mentioned that the name change was decided after filming was completed and was not within his control. He said he would not understand the reason behind the change until he saw the movie."I will not understand why it happened till I watch the film. And even if anyone thinks that...making a noise will not help," Chatterjee remarked.‘The Bengal Files’ trailer launch rowDirector Vivek Agnihotri claimed that the trailer launch of his movie was halted on Saturday.
