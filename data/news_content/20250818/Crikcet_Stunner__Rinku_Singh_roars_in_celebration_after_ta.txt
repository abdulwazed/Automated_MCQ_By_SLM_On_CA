Rinku Singh's fiery celebration in the UP T20 League (Screengrabs) Rinku Singh, widely known for role as a middle-order finisher, produced a moment of magic with the ball in the opening clash of the UP T20 League 2025. Leading the Meerut Mavericks against the Kanpur Superstars at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Stadium in Lucknow, Rinku struck with his very first delivery, sending the stumps flying and roaring in celebration. The part-time off-spinner, who has been under the radar of selectors ahead of the Asia Cup 2025, clean bowled Kanpur opener Aadarsh Singh in the powerplay. The dismissal not only stunned the opposition and brought out a passionate celebration from the player. He pumped his fist, let out a roar and then was congratulated by his teammates.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Earlier in the evening, Meerut Mavericks had posted a formidable 225/2. After a quick start from Akshay Dubey (44 off 26) and Rituraj Sharma (60 off 36), it was Madhav Kaushik who stole the show. Walking in at No. 4, Kaushik blazed his way to an unbeaten 95 off just 31 balls, striking 10 fours and seven sixes at a staggering strike rate of 306. His fireworks ensured Meerut set Kanpur a daunting 226-run target. In reply, the Superstars never found momentum. Reduced to 13/3 inside the powerplay, they were eventually restricted to 139/9.
