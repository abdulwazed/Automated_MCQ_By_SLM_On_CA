The selection decision remains complex due to India's packed top-order batting lineup and scheduling challenges, with multiple players vying for limited spots.   Gill has already established himself as a formidable force in ODIs, accumulating 2,775 runs and 22 fifty-plus scores in 55 matches. Reports suggest he could potentially return to the T20I team as vice-captain and might be in line for ODI leadership once current captain Rohit Sharma retires.   In his most recent T20 appearance during IPL 2025, Gill demonstrated his prowess by scoring 650 runs at a strike rate of nearly 156, including six fifties in 15 matches, finishing as the fourth-highest run-getter.   Gill's T20I career has shown steady improvement. He concluded 2024 with 266 runs in eight T20Is at an average of 38.00 and a strike rate of 133, including two fifties during the Zimbabwe series. His overall T20I statistics stand at 578 runs in 21 matches at an average of 30.42 and a strike rate exceeding 139.   The scheduling complexity poses a significant challenge for selectors. The Asia Cup final concludes on September 28, with home Tests against West Indies beginning October 2. This tight schedule requires careful consideration in team selection.   India's T20I performance has been remarkable since their T20 World Cup victory, winning 17 out of 20 bilateral series. During Gill's absence, several players have strengthened their positions in the team.   Abhishek Sharma has particularly impressed, scoring 279 runs against England with a strike rate of 220, including a spectacular 135 off 54 balls at Wankhede. Since the last T20 World Cup, he has amassed 1,363 runs in 42 matches at an average of 34.94 and a strike rate exceeding 198.   Tilak Varma has also shown consistent performance, scoring 1,200 runs in 36 matches at an average of 50.00 and a strike rate of 153.84 since the last T20 World Cup. He recorded two centuries during the South Africa tour.   Sanju Samson has reinvented himself as an opener alongside Abhishek, scoring 908 runs in 31 T20s at an average of 33.62 and a strike rate of 157.09 since the last T20 World Cup.   Captain Suryakumar Yadav has contributed 1,107 runs in T20s at an average of 36.90 and a strike rate of 161.13, though his international form has declined recently.   Gill's recent T20 statistics remain impressive, with 893 runs in 22 matches at an average of 47.00 and a strike rate over 147 since the last T20 World Cup.   Yashasvi Jaiswal, who like Gill last played T20I in July 2024, presents another strong candidacy with 723 runs in 23 T20Is, including a century and five fifties at a strike rate exceeding 164.   The current Samson-Abhishek opening combination makes it challenging to accommodate both Gill and Jaiswal in the playing XI. With a 15-member squad limit for the Asia Cup and World Cup, selecting all four players - Abhishek, Samson, Gill, and Jaiswal - appears unlikely, considering the need for backup players in other roles.   The final selection may come down to choosing between Jaiswal and Gill, with Samson holding an advantage as a wicketkeeper-batsman. The selectors will need to evaluate who can make a more significant impact in the upcoming tournaments. 18:32 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Will Shreyas Iyer feature in the squad?With Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, and Axar Patel already assured of their middle-order roles, India still has room for two — possibly even three or more batting spots to fill.At No. 3, the battle is shaping up between Tilak Varma, who currently holds the position, and Shreyas Iyer. Shreyas had a standout IPL 2025 with Punjab Kings, striking at 175.07 — the third-best in IPL history for a season with 600 or more runs, behind only Chris Gayle (2011) and Suryakumar (2023). His ability to take on spin adds further weight to his case.18:12 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Too many options? India selectors face a happy headacheIndian selectors are spoilt for choices ahead of a big T20 season, thanks to extensive IPL scouting, which has broadened the player pool.

The T20I tournament, scheduled in the UAE from September 9-28, will see India compete in Group A alongside Pakistan, UAE, and Oman, with the event being viewed as a crucial testing ground for India's T20I core ahead of next year's T20 World Cup.The selection committee faces important decisions regarding the opening batting positions for the tournament. With Rohit Sharma's absence confirmed, the competition for opening slots has intensified between players like Shubman Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and Sanju Samson."There are a few talking points regarding the Asia Cup. The first question that comes to everyone's mind is whether Shubman Gill fits into the T20 plans because in the last World Cup, Yashasvi Jaiswal was the backup opener," Ashwin said on his YouTube channel. "So Jaiswal automatically gets a kick-in. Rohit Sharma is not going to be a part of that team, so Jaiswal automatically gets a look-in. Now, who is going to be that other opener?"The selection scenario is further complicated by the recent performances of multiple players vying for spots in the team. Gill's impressive recent Test series performance and Samson's success as a T20 opener have created additional considerations for the selectors."Shubman Gill had an outstanding series. Can he return to the squad? Sanju Samson has had a fabulous run as a T20 opener for India. So I think it is a tricky state for the selectors," Ashwin explained.The selection committee must also consider the potential return of Shreyas Iyer to the squad. "Can Shreyas Iyer make a comeback? There is a lot of decision-making that the selectors have to make," Ashwin remarked.08:53 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Pakistan squadSalman Ali Agha (captain), Abrar Ahmed, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Hasan Nawaz, Hussain Talat, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Haris (wicket-keeper), Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Waseem Jnr, Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, Salman Mirza, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Sufyan Moqim.08:45 (IST) Aug 18India Asia Cup Squad Announcement Live: Gill vs Jaiswal – the final selection battle?Yashasvi Jaiswal, who last played a T20I in July 2024, has 723 runs in 23 matches at a strike rate of 164+, including a century.

The Asia Cup will be played in the UAE from September 9-28, with India scheduled to open their campaign against the hosts on September 10, while the marquee fixture against arch-rivals Pakistan is slated on September 14, both in Dubai.We will be bringing you all the live updates. Stay tuned.India Asia Cup 2025 Squad Announcement Live Update: Ahead of the Ajit Agarkar-led selection panel's meeting to pick India's Asia Cup squad, all eyes will be on Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal, whether the two explosive batters will find a place in India's Asia Cup squad. 

The Asia Cup will be played in the UAE from September 9-28, with India scheduled to open their campaign against the hosts on September 10, while the marquee fixture against arch-rivals Pakistan is slated on September 14, both in Dubai.

If all are fit and available, Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson (batter-keeper), Tilak Varma, skipper Surya Kumar Yadav and Hardik Pandya are automatic selections in top-five.

Now with Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal, two players with proven IPL records are back in the mix, the selectors will have to make some compromise with regards to one or two slots.

And this is pretty clear that at least in this Asia Cup, both Gill and Jaiswal wouldn't be in the same squad till Abhishek and Sanju are automatic choices.

India are placed along with arch-rivals Pakistan in Group A, also featuring the UAE and Oman, in the eight-team Asia Cup tournament which will be held from September 9 to 28.TrendingSuryakumar YadavSaaniya ChandhokMS DhoniShahid AfridiIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementGautam GambhirVirat KohliCincinnati Open Final Live StreamingKedar JadhavR AshwinSuryakumar YadavSaaniya ChandhokMS DhoniShahid AfridiIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementGautam GambhirVirat KohliCincinnati Open Final Live StreamingKedar JadhavR AshwinSuryakumar YadavSaaniya ChandhokMS DhoniShahid AfridiIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementGautam GambhirVirat KohliCincinnati Open Final Live StreamingKedar JadhavR AshwinTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTop Stories Right NowAsia Cup 2025: Suryakumar Yadav to stay as India’s T20I captain, Shubman Gill li...Cricket | 'Ek banda fail hue ja raha hai 3, 4, 5 saal...' - Irfan Pathan backs G...Blast from the past: Arjun Tendulkar’s fiancée Saaniya Chandhok spotted in old v...More TOP StoriesQuick LinksWTC Points TableNHL NewsNBA NewsEsports and Gaming NewsLatest Cricket NewsWWE NewsCricket Match ScheduleInternational SportsMLB NewsNFL NewsEducation NewsLive Cricket ScoreExplore Every CornerAcross The GlobeIndia Asia Cup Squad AnnouncementTravis KelceRussell Wilson WifeDwyane Wade WifeVanessa BryantLebron JamesMumbai RainsAuston MatthewTravis Hunter WifeLeanna LeneeWWE RAW PreviewCraig BerubeTrump Zelenskyy MeetingSamuel MontembeaultWayne GretzkyCaleb WilliamsSpencer RattlerSophie Cunningham InjuryChris BoswellDeng MayarCP Radhakrishnan Educational QualificationHangor-class submarineITR Filing 2025Bank Holidays AugustGSTFlorida turnpike accidentBrooklyn shootingMumbai RainsQantas AirwaysConnor McDavidAbout usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesLiving and EntertainmentCricbuzzLifestyleNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTVTimes PrimeTravel DestinationsWhats HotETimesTimes LifeTimes PetsMyLifeXPServicesCouponDuniaTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgetsTimes EventsWork with UsColombiaHot on the WebCloves Health BenefitsTulsi Health BenefitsBlood Pressure ManagementLow CholesterolKidney Disease SymptomsLongest International RiverGuava Health BenefitsLow Value CurrencyHome Aquarium Setup GuideFoods That Weaken BonesKidney Cancer SymptomsJaved AkhtarArmaan MalikShah Rukh KhanHrithik RoshanAnushka SharmaAjithLiver Disease SymptomsColon Cancer SymptomsMonsoon Snake PreventionJessica RadcliffeCobra Safety TipsWar 2 Box Office CollectionNational Couples Day WishesCoolie Movie ReviewCoolie Box Office CollectionMahavatar Narsimha Box Office CollectionKapil SharmaSaiyaara Box Office CollectionDarshan ThoogudeepaSaiyaara Movie ReviewColon Cancer SymptomsSanskrit EffectNatural SupplementsHigh Cholesterol SymptomsSide Effects Of Dragon FruitColorectal CancerOral SymptomsReduce Face Fat DietSide Effects Of BananasGinger Tea Side EffectsKidney Damage SymptomsTrending TopicsSunil GavaskarSchool Holidays ListRinku SinghJannik Sinner vs Carlos AlcarazArjun TendulkarShubman GillJKBOSE Bi Annual ExamRajasthan PTET Seat AllotmentPSSSB Group B RecruitmentSuryakumar YadavIGNOU July RegistrationCBSE CTET NotificationBSSC CGL 4 RecruitmentShah Rukh KhanNeymar JRKedar JadhavGautam GambhirJaved MiandadTN NEET UG Seat AllotmentMumbai RainsMeerut Army Jawan AssaultedDelhi Bomb ThreatJabalpur Bank RobberyBengaluru Assault NewsDelhi RapeManisha Murder CaseMumbai Heavy RainfallHyderabad Janmashtami NewsBhopal RapeMumbai RainfallParag AgrawalFastag Annual PassSam AltmanGeoffrey HintonSridhar VembuApple iPhone 17Nyt ConnectionsMega Tsunami WarningGithub CeoJamie DimonWordle TodaySteve JobsPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth+ TipsIndian TV ShowsTechnologyTravelEtimesHealth & FitnessNFLAugust Long Weekend 2025India vs EnglandAstrologyWeather TodayPlatinum Rate TodaySilver Rate TodayGold Rate TodayIs Bank open todayIs Bank Open TomorrowBank Holidays in AugustPublic Holidays in AugustStock Market HolidaysFinancial CalculatorsTechnology NewsInternational SportsPublic HolidaysBank HolidaysLatest NewsTop 5 entertainment news: Larissa Bonesi calls Aryan Khan 'unstoppable', Sunjay Kapur's sister praises Karisma Kapoor, Virat Kohli-Anushka Sharma chat with locals in London3 things parents can do if your child is burnt outYeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai: Maira questions why Abhira can’t marry Armaan againBanking-TieUp: BoM, SBI Card launch co-branded credit card;
