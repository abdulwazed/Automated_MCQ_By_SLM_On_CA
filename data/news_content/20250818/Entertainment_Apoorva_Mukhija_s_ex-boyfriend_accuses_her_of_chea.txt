Adding to the drama, ex-boyfriend Utsav Dahiya accuses Apoorva of cheating and using their relationship for content.  After the India’s Got Latent controversy settled, influencer Apoorva Mukhija found herself in the spotlight once again with her stint on Karan Johar’s reality show The Traitors. On the show, she was often discussed alongside fellow content creator Sufi Motiwala. But now, Sufi has publicly declared that he and Apoorva are no longer friends, citing her lack of support when he was targeted by trolls from her audience.In an Instagram story, Sufi clarified, “No more lies. I’ve received a lot of texts saying that I’ve taken clout from Apoorva and I’ve left her. I’ve literally never collaborated on a reel with her and have been on her YouTube twice, both of which were her content pieces entirely. So no I’m not sorry I didn’t use her for clout (incase u forgot we were on the same show without knowing each other I don’t need her clout) I wanted to be friends with Apoorva not the rebel kid when there was no accountability constantly for how I was being treated I distanced myself.”Uorfi Javed vs Apoorva Mukhija: ‘The Traitors’ Reality Show Fight Gets UGLYWhile Sufi distanced himself, Apoorva’s ex-boyfriend Utsav Dahiya also took to Instagram with a sharp takedown of the influencer. In a recent post, Utsav accused her of cheating, even sharing a song in which he called her out, alleging that she wanted to reconcile purely for “content.” He also claimed that Apoorva used the word “ghatiya” for him only to boost social media engagement.Part of his caption read: “Ab agar koi aur bakwaas kari toh main seedha receipts nikalunga. Never try to gain sympathy by fabricating lies or pushing false narratives just to make content and assassinate someone’s character online. Having a big following doesn’t give you the right to bully your way by rage-baiting your audience and unleashing them on others.”Utsav further alleged that Apoorva and her team dismissed his concerns when he was being trolled due to her accusations: “When I was being falsely painted as a cheat and an abuser because of things you said, I reached out to you and your agency, hoping to find a way to deal with the hate. Instead, I was told, ‘You’re a nobody, you should be happy you got to date her.’ So here’s a message from that ‘nobody’: you tried your level best (and I won’t lie, it wasn’t easy), but I’m still here, still standing. That should tell you something: your big numbers only matter on an app. There’s a real and much bigger world outside, beyond lies and kalesh.”He concluded by saying, "Truth doesn't need 'followers', it stands on its own. Toh tum chalao apna ghar kalesh se, but kisi ke baare mein jhoot bolna band karo. Baki logo ko life mein dhanke kaam karne do. Grow up, kid. (and here's a rhyme for you that might be more up your speed .... in case it helps)" With his caption, he sang a song dedicated to her which also hinted at their story. Apoorva and Utsav had announced their breakup earlier this year in January. Since then, she has repeatedly hinted at him in her content, accusing him of cheating and abuse without taking his name directly. In his latest post too, Utsav avoided naming her, but the message left little doubt for followers about whom he was addressing."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
