CP Radhakrishnan educational qualification and political career: From Tamil Nadu BJP leader to Maharashtra governor and NDA vice-presidential candidate Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader CP Radhakrishnan has been named as the National Democratic Alliance's (NDA) candidate for the upcoming vice-presidential election. The announcement came after the resignation of Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar, with the election scheduled to take place on September 9. Radhakrishnan currently serves as the Governor of Maharashtra and holds additional responsibilities as Governor of Telangana and Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry.This appointment marks a significant milestone in Radhakrishnan's over four-decade-long political career, which began with his association with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Bharatiya Janata Party in Tamil Nadu. His educational background and diverse political experience have played key roles in his rise to prominent positions within Indian politics.Early life and educational qualificationChandrapuram Ponnusamy Radhakrishnan was born in Tiruppur, Tamil Nadu, into the Kongu Vellalar Gounder community. He holds a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) degree from V. O. Chidambaram College in Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu. Alongside his academic pursuits, he was a college-level table tennis champion, showcasing a diverse range of interests from an early age.From the age of 17, Radhakrishnan was actively involved with the RSS and Bharatiya Jana Sangh. His formal entry into politics came with his election to the Jan Sangh's state executive committee in 1974, laying the foundation for his long political journey.Political career in Tamil Nadu and Lok SabhaRadhakrishnan first rose to national prominence as a two-time Member of Parliament (MP) representing Coimbatore in the Lok Sabha, winning elections in 1998 and 1999. His 1998 election was notable as he was one of three BJP candidates to win in Tamil Nadu following the party's alliance with the AIADMK, an important achievement in the state's political landscape. During his tenure, he served as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Textiles and was a member of committees on Public Sector Undertakings and Finance.He was also part of the Indian parliamentary delegation to the United Nations General Assembly in 2004, where he addressed humanitarian and disaster relief coordination. His political career in Tamil Nadu further advanced when he became the BJP state president from 2004 to 2007. During this period, he undertook a 93-day, 19,000-kilometre 'Ratha Yatra', advocating various social and environmental causes across the state.Governorship and administrative rolesIn 2016, Radhakrishnan was appointed Chairman of the Coir Board, under the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, where he oversaw record exports valued at Rs 2,532 crore. He later served as BJP's all-India in-charge for Kerala from 2020 to 2022, contributing to the party's organisational efforts in the state.In February 2023, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appointed Radhakrishnan as the Governor of Jharkhand. Within his first four months in office, he visited all 24 districts to engage with local officials and citizens. In July 2024, he assumed office as Governor of Maharashtra. Around the same time, he was given additional responsibilities as Governor of Telangana and Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry, roles he held until July 2024 before handing over to successors.NDA's vice-presidential candidateFollowing the resignation of Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar citing health reasons, BJP national president JP Nadda announced CP Radhakrishnan's candidacy for the vice-presidential election. Radhakrishnan's vast experience in politics and governance, combined with his organisational background and administrative roles as governor, positions him as a seasoned candidate for the post.The vice-presidential election will be held on September 9, with the last date for filing nominations on August 21 and withdrawal by August 25.
