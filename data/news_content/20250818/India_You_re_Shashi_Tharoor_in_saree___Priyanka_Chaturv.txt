She also criticized the Election Commission of India, expressing concerns about eroding public trust and perceived bias towards the BJP.  NEW DELHI: A humorous moment of Shiv Sena (UBT) Rajya Sabha MP Priyanka Chaturvedi on a podcast brought Congress Lok Sabha MP Shashi Tharoor again into the limelight. During a podcast interview, Chaturvedi was questioned about posting pictures with Prime Minister Modi and public reactions. She quipped, “I sometimes love irritating people, because they are so invested in my life, where is she going next, where’s she going next?” Prakash responded by joking, “You’re basically Shashi Tharoor in a saree.” Chaturvedi laughed, saying, “I don’t know whether that is a compliment for Shashi or for me, but I am going to tell Shashi.”PollDo you think Priyanka Chaturvedi's comments about irritating people were humorous?Yes, very funnyNo, not funny at all The clip was later shared on X by Chaturvedi, prompting a witty reply from Tharoor: “Thanks Priyanka. I consider myself flattered either way.” Chaturvedi mentioned she first shared her picture with Narendra Modi on Instagram, which subsequently spread on X and other platforms. She recounted in a funny, imitating tone, “We had said she went on the Parliament delegation, and it happened there.” Chaturvedi was part of the Group-2 delegation led by BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad that visited European nations to highlight India’s stance against terrorism. The visit followed India’s Operation Sindoor, targeting terror infrastructures in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.When asked about representing India after Opertaion Sindoor, especially being in opposition, Chaturvedi said, "That I'm a very vocal member of the opposition when I'm in my country. But when I'm outside my country, I'm the ambassador for my nation." She also criticised the Election Commission of India (ECI), stating that public trust in the poll body is waning. “Day by day, new names are being added and removed from the rolls. Now, the system has been exposed. We have seen their press conference, and the language used was deeply unfortunate. Today, people no longer trust the Election Commission. The public will surely ask why their confidence is not being earned. It seems the Commission is focused only on winning the BJP’s trust,” Chaturvedi told ANI.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
