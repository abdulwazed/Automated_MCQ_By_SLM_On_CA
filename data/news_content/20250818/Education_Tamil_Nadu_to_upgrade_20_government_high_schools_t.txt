The initiative aims to improve access to Class 11–12 education in rural and semi-urban areas, reduce dropout rates, and strengthen public schools amid declining enrollment, with an estimated expenditure of Rs 29.39 crore.  Chennai, India: The Department of School Education has announced plans to upgrade 20 government high schools across Tamil Nadu into higher secondary schools for the 2025–26 academic year.The initiative, aimed at expanding access to higher secondary education, follows a budget announcement earlier this year by School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi.As part of the upgradation process, 200 postgraduate teachers will be appointed, with ten teachers assigned to each school. Subject-wise allocations include Tamil, English, physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, history, economics, computer science, and commerce.Teachers will be recruited under the pay scale of Rs 36,900–1,16,600 (Level-18), with the state government approving an estimated expenditure of Rs 29.39 crore for the project.Among the schools identified for upgradation is Mathur Government High School in Chennai’s Madhavaram block. Other districts benefiting include Cuddalore, Kallakurichi, Krishnagiri, Chengalpattu, Dindigul, Tiruchy, Tirupattur, Madurai, Villupuram, Ramanathapuram, Tiruppur, Salem, Tiruvannamalai, Nagapattinam, and Kanniyakumari.Officials said the initiative aims to ensure students in rural and semi-urban areas can continue studies up to Class 12 without shifting schools or discontinuing education.“It is about time certain high schools are upgraded. This will help reduce dropout rates and encourage students to pursue higher education within their localities,” a government school teacher said.However, the development comes amid challenges in the state’s education system, with declining enrollment in several schools. The Department of Elementary Education (DEE) recently closed 208 state-run schools due to zero admissions. Overall, 1,204 schools across Tamil Nadu recorded no new enrollments this academic year, including 208 government primary and middle schools, 114 government-aided schools, 11 partially-funded schools, 869 private institutions, and two union government schools.Officials hope that upgrading high schools to higher secondary will strengthen the public school system and restore confidence among parents and communities in state-run institutions.
