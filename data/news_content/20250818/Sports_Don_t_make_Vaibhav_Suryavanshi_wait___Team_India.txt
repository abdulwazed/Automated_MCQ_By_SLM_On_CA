Srikkanth's endorsement comes as selectors prepare to finalize the squad on August 19, amid intense competition for spots, particularly in the opening positions.Vaibhav Suryavanshi has emerged as a strong contender following his performance in IPL 2025, where he scored 252 runs in seven matches for Rajasthan Royals at a strike rate exceeding 200. He also claimed the second-fastest century in IPL history, reaching the milestone in 35 deliveries against Gujarat Titans.Everything is special about Vaibhav Suryavanshi: Vikram RathourGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!The young prodigy continued his impressive form during the U19 tour of England, scoring a century and delivering strong performances in both one-day and four-day formats."You have to play bold. Don't make him wait. Don't say things like 'let him mature'. He is already playing with remarkable maturity. His shot-making has been on another level. If I were chairman, I would definitely have him in the squad," Srikkanth stated on his YouTube show.The selection discussion involves several established players, including Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson, who have secured their positions with an aggressive approach under coach Gautam Gambhir. Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill and current IPL Orange Cap holder Sai Sudharsan are also in contention.Srikkanth expressed uncertainty about Sanju Samson's inclusion in the squad and outlined his preferred opening combinations."Samson is doubtful, according to me," Srikkanth said. "My first-choice opener is Abhishek Sharma, no doubt. I will have two more openers. My picks would be Vaibhav Suryavanshi or Sai Sudharsan, with Shubman Gill as an option. If I were a selector, I would keep Vaibhav in the 15 for the T20 World Cup. He has been outstanding."PollShould Vaibhav Suryavanshi be included in India's squad for the Asia Cup T20?Yes, absolutely!No, he should wait."I think it should be Yashasvi Jaiswal, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, and Sai Sudharsan. I would take two out of these three. That would be my preference," he added.Since the T20 World Cup final in June 2024, Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson have been India's leading run-scorers in T20 internationals. Both players have received support from the team management, including head coach Gambhir and captain Suryakumar Yadav, for their aggressive batting style.Abhishek has accumulated 535 runs at an average of 33.43 with a strike rate of 193.84, including two centuries during this period. Samson has scored three hundreds in 17 matches at a strike rate of 171.47.However, Samson's recent performance in the five-match series against England has raised concerns. He struggled against short-pitched bowling and recorded three single-digit scores in five innings.Srikkanth, who previously captained a 16-year-old Sachin Tendulkar during his debut in Pakistan in 1989, believes India should not delay incorporating Vaibhav into the national setup as they prepare for next year's T20 World Cup.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
