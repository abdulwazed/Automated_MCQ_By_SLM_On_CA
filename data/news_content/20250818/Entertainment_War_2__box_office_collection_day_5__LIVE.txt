While the Hindi version rebounded strongly, the Telugu version saw a significant drop over the weekend, with total collections reaching ₹175.  'War 2' released in theatres on August 14, a day before Independence day and clashed at the box office with 'Coolie'. While it's one of the biggest clashes of movies, it's also a long three-day weekend which may end up in the favour of both the movies. While on the first day, 'War 2' was behind 'Coolie' as both the movies made Rs 51.5 crore and Rs 65 crore respectively. However, on day 2 which is Independence Day, 'War 2' performed better. Over the weekend the film has remained decent with more than Rs 30 crore each on Saturday and Sunday. War 2 Movie ReviewDespite lukewarm critical reviews and a mixed response from audiences online, the film’s second-day performance has been impressive. According to Sacnilk, the day 2 collection of the film which saw growth due to Independence day, is Rs 56.50 crore. Thus, it has crossed the Rs 100 crore mark within two days in all languages, according to Sacnilk. 'War 2' has released in Hindi, Telugu and Tamil. The Telugu version of the film also got a great response due to Jr NTR's presence but on day 2 there was growth in the Hindi belt. The spike was fueled by stronger occupancies in key metros and robust evening-to-night show numbers. The holiday effect in certain territories, coupled with steady single-screen turnout in mass markets, also played a big role in the Hindi version’s rebound.'War 2' review: Stylish spy thriller with Hrithik–Jr NTR chemistry divides fans over story and VFXOn Saturday, the film made Rs 33 crore of which the Hindi version made Rs 26 crore.
