He went on to explain that the left-handed batter is extremely particular about his appearance. “Ishan really needs to get his hair perfectly to be happy,” Klaasen remarked, adding that Kishan’s obsession with grooming stands out in the squad. However, Klaasen didn’t let Kishan take the entire spotlight, pointing out that Australian leg-spinner Adam Zampa is also right up there when it comes to hairstyles. Referring to Zampa’s exciting hairstyles over the years, he joked that the spinner probably is the "haircut enthusiast".PollWho has the best hairstyle in the SRH team?Ishan KishanAdam Zampa Kishan was again at the center of attention when Klaasen was asked about the best actor in the SRH squad.
