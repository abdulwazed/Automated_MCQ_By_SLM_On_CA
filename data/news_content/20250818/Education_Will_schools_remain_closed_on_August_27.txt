It is also recognised as a public holiday in states such as Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, and Telangana, where schools might remain closed to allow students and families to participate.In other regions, the holiday status depends on government notifications or school board directives. States where Ganesh Chaturthi is not traditionally observed may continue with regular academic schedules.August 2025: A festive month for studentsThis year, August has brought a cluster of holidays. Independence Day on August 15 was observed nationwide, while Raksha Bandhan (August 9) and Janmashtami (August 16) were regional holidays.
