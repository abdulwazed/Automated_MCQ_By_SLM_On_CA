Virat Kohli (AFP Photo) NEW DELHI: Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has responded to criticism directed at him for his remarks on Virat Kohli’s batting, particularly surrounding the star batter’s retirement from Test cricket in May after a disappointing series in Australia in 2024-25. Kohli managed just 190 runs in nine innings during the series, despite scoring a century in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.Kohli announced his retirement from the longest format just before India’s squad selection for the England Tests, a decision that came amid a visible dip in his red-ball form. His struggles were evident in the pattern of dismissals, with the former captain frequently falling in the slips or to the wicketkeeper.Virat Kohli, Ravi Shastri & India’s Pace Revolution | Bharat Arun Reveals Untold Team India StoriesGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"If you look at my social media, there was Virat Kohli's slump in 2019-20. At that time, it was said that it was the time of COVID, and he wasn't getting inspiration. I thought that when a player of big stature undergoes their first slump, then they should be backed. If you look at my social media, I backed him a lot. One, he deserved it, and won a lot of matches. If the slump continues for five years, then it's not right," Pathan told Lallantop.PollDo you agree with Irfan Pathan's criticism of Virat Kohli's batting performance?Yes, he is rightNo, he is too harshPathan stressed that the team’s success must always remain the priority."Eventually, the team has to be at the top. Team is No. 1; we play for the team, we play to win games. If a batsman gets out in a similar manner, the opposition team plans accordingly. They won't go to plan B. They will get you out using plan A. If you're a champion player, then you've to take them from plan A to plan B. The problem with Virat in Test cricket was that he was getting out similarly every now and then. That doesn't mean he's a bad player; he's a champion player, but it's happening. You've to explain what you are seeing in detail," he saidThe former cricketer also elaborated on his role as a commentator, underlining that his accountability lies with the fans:"See, I believe that as a broadcaster, when the commentary is going on and the fans are watching the match, you have to go ahead of the visuals and speak about what's happening. The broadcaster and commentator's work is - what is happening and why it is happening. What can happen and how? If a player is doing exceptionally well, you praise him, and if they are not performing well, then criticize him. The commentators' responsibility is towards the fans, not players."Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
