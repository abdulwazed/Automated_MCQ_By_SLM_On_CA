Despite this, she has achieved significant success, including an Ivor Novello Award, while openly addressing body image and mental health. Canal's resilience shines through her music and advocacy.  TRIGGER WARNING: This article includes references to sexual abuseVictoria Canal, a Spanish-American singer and songwriter, has courageously revealed that she was groomed and abused by a “very powerful, decades-older man” early in her career. In a heartfelt Instagram post, she shared how the abuse lasted over a year and how she was manipulated into silence, being told that speaking out would end her career before it had even begun.Victoria Canal UNMASKS ‘POWERFUL’ ABUSER; 'June Baby' Star Exposes Grooming HorrorBeyond this revelation, Canal has been open about her life and challenges. Born with a congenital condition, she refuses to be defined by it. According to a Prime Timer report, Canal was born without the lower half of her right arm. She has compared it to something as ordinary as having “an unlucky-shaped nose” and insists she does not want to be boxed as ‘the one-armed singer’ like Stevie Wonder, who is not solely defined by blindness.Her unique perspective has shaped her music. Canal learned to play piano without her right hand, developing special chord voicings and creative techniques that are central to her songwriting.Global upbringing shaped her early careerAs reported by Hindustan Times, she was born in Munich and raised across the globe. Canal often communicated online due to her family’s nomadic lifestyle. Her breakthrough came through Instagram, where short clips of her performances caught the attention of artists like Michael Franti and Emily King, who later invited her on tour.Since then, Canal has shared stages with major acts, fronted Nike’s Jordan FlyEase campaign, and in 2024, she won the prestigious Ivor Novello Award in the UK for songwriting. Her music is known for its honesty and vulnerability, exploring themes of body image, identity, and resilience.Shocking abuse allegations revealed publiclyEarlier this month, Canal revealed in an Instagram post that early in her career she was groomed and abused by a “very powerful, decades-older man” who had offered her first professional break. She described how she was manipulated into silence by the abuser, who made her believe that no one else wanted her. Canal wrote that she was told speaking about the abuse would end her career before it had even begun, according to Music Ally.Victoria said the experience, which lasted just over a year, has had a lasting effect on her intimate life. Sharing her truth, she explained, was part of her healing journey. Although she did not name her alleged abuser, speculation online suggested it could be musician Michael Franti. ETimes cannot independently verify this.Reclaiming power through honestyFor Canal, speaking openly about abuse is part of reclaiming her power, just like her previous disclosures about body image and mental health. She shared a strong message to her fans,“Whatever you look like, whatever you are feeling, you are accepted, you are enough. You are more than enough.”DISCLAIMER: If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, assault, or abuse, please seek immediate help.
