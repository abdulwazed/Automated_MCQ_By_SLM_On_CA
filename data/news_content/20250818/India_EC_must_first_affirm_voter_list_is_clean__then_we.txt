Concerns were raised about voter list irregularities in Maharashtra and Karnataka. Trinamool Congress leader Mahua Moitra called for dissolving the Lok Sabha. The opposition demands accountability from the Election Commission. Joint press conference by INDIA bloc leaders NEW DELHI: The INDIA bloc on Monday intensified its attack on the Election Commission, accusing it of misconduct in recent elections and questioning its decision to conduct a special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar just ahead of the state polls. Citing alleged irregularities in Maharashtra and Karnataka, leaders sharpened their criticism, with TMC’s Mahua Moitra even urging to "dissolve Lok Sabha immediately."The joint press conference, held at the Constitution Club of India, was attended by senior opposition leaders including Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi, SP’s Ramgopal Yadav, TMC’s Mahua Moitra, RJD’s Manoj Jha, AAP’s Sanjay Singh and others.Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi alleged that the EC failed to address serious concerns. "EC silent on voter additions in Maharashtra, discrepancies in rolls in Mahadevapura, video data deletion," he said. Gogoi further added, "EC in hands of officers who are taking sides, not probing any charges made by Opposition."PollDo you agree with the opposition's claim that the Election Commission is failing to address serious concerns?Yes, I agree.No, I disagree.At the presser, Congress leader said, "EC should first provide an affidavit that the voter list is clean, then we'll comply."Criticising the poll body’s recent actions, Gogoi remarked, "In its press conference yesterday, the EC (Election Commission) raised questions about the political parties when they had to explain why they were conducting SIR in a hurry. EC was silent on SIR in Bihar. They were also silent on how new 70 lakh voters were added between Lok Sabha and Maharashtra Assembly elections... It is clear that EC is under such officials who are not unbiased."TMC MP Mahua Moitra also raised concerns, saying, "West Bengal CM raised issue of duplicate EPIC voter cards, but issue not resolved." She went on to demand accountability, adding, "Action should be taken against past ECs for 'fraudulent' voter lists, dissolve Lok Sabha immediately."Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Arvind Sawant also hit out at the EC, saying, "The whimsical behaviour of the CEC made it seem like he was acting as a BJP spokesperson."About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
