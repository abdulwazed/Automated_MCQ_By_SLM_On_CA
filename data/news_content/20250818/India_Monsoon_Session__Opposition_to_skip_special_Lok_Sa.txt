Tharoor emphasized the mission's invaluable contribution to Gaganyaan, citing hands-on experience, crucial data, and the testing of Indian systems.  NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Monday said the Opposition will not participate in the special discussion in the Lok Sabha on astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla’s space mission. However, Tharoor praised the achievement, calling it a landmark moment for India’s space ambitions replying to Kiren Rijiju's post on X urging discussion on Shubhanshu Shukla.“Since the Opposition are not participating in the special discussion, let me say how proud all Indians are of the recent mission of Commander Shubhanshu Shukla to the International Space Station (ISS). It served as a stepping stone to our nation's own human spaceflight program, Gaganyaan. Shukla's mission provided ISRO invaluable hands-on experience & data that cannot be replicated in simulations,” Tharoor wrote on X.He said Shukla’s first-hand observations on pre-launch procedures, spacecraft systems, and the psychological and physiological effects of microgravity were crucial for de-risking and refining the Gaganyaan mission. “The mission allowed for the testing of Indian systems & protocols in a real-life space environment. The numerous scientific experiments, including studies on human health in space and plant growth, provide technological and scientific validation which will directly help design the life-support and medical systems for Gaganyaan,” Tharoor added.The Congress MP also underscored the diplomatic impact of the mission. “Shukla's mission, conducted in partnership with international agencies, reinforced India's role in global space diplomacy. It demonstrates India's willingness and capability to engage in multilateral space efforts and opens doors for future joint research and investment,” he said.Tharoor concluded that the astronaut’s historic feat would inspire India’s youth. “Commander Shukla's historic flight serves as a powerful symbol of India's ambitions in human spaceflight. It has captured the nation's imagination, inspiring a new generation to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, maths and space studies — all essential for sustaining India's long-term space goals. Well done!”Union minister Kiren Rijiju meanwhile said the Lok Sabha would honour Shukla with a special discussion. “Our hero astronaut Capt Subhanshu Shukla has returned home after a successful mission to International Space Station. Parliament will honour him with a special discussion on his historic milestone and India’s growing space ambitions in our journey towards,” Rijiju wrote on X.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
