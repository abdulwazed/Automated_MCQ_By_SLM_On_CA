While the Hindi version rebounded strongly, the Telugu version saw a significant drop over the weekend, with total collections reaching ₹175.  'War 2' released in theatres on August 14, a day before Independence day and clashed at the box office with 'Coolie'. While it's one of the biggest clashes of movies, it's also a long three-day weekend which may end up in the favour of both the movies. While on the first day, 'War 2' was behind 'Coolie' as both the movies made Rs 51.5 crore and Rs 65 crore respectively. However, on day 2 which is Independence Day, 'War 2' performed better. Over the weekend the film has remained decent with more than Rs 30 crore each on Saturday and Sunday. War 2 Movie ReviewDespite lukewarm critical reviews and a mixed response from audiences online, the film’s second-day performance has been impressive. According to Sacnilk, the day 2 collection of the film which saw growth due to Independence day, is Rs 56.50 crore. Thus, it has crossed the Rs 100 crore mark within two days in all languages, according to Sacnilk. 'War 2' has released in Hindi, Telugu and Tamil. The Telugu version of the film also got a great response due to Jr NTR's presence but on day 2 there was growth in the Hindi belt. The spike was fueled by stronger occupancies in key metros and robust evening-to-night show numbers. The holiday effect in certain territories, coupled with steady single-screen turnout in mass markets, also played a big role in the Hindi version’s rebound.'War 2' review: Stylish spy thriller with Hrithik–Jr NTR chemistry divides fans over story and VFXOn Saturday, the film made Rs 33 crore of which the Hindi version made Rs 26 crore.

Ameesha Patel, a true South Bombay girl, has an impressive collection of nearly 400 luxury bags, including Birkin and Bottega Veneta pieces worth crores. Filmmaker Farah Khan toured her collection, admiring its rarity and value, while Ameesha joked about her expensive hobby costing her a Mumbai penthouse. Before making her debut in ‘Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai’, Ameesha Patel was already known as a true South Bombay girl, a fact reflected in her impressive handbag collection. Coming from a family with strong roots in business and politics, she began amassing designer bags at just 12 years old. Today, her collection boasts nearly 400 bags, each valued in lakhs of rupees. Recently, filmmaker and choreographer Farah Khan toured Ameesha’s home and shared a sneak peek of this stunning assortment.Farah Khan is amazed by Ameesha’s extensive collectionAt the start of the vlog, Farah expressed her amazement, saying, “I have never seen Ameesha repeat her bag. She must have the maximum number of designer bags in the industry.” Ameesha then shared that her collection includes around 300 to 400 luxury bags, in addition to several clutches and belt bags. Alongside handbags, she is also passionate about collecting luxury watches.Ameesha Patel Returns: Casual Look, Classic Charm In JuhuBirkin bags are stored in an organized cupboardFarah indicated a cupboard and remarked, “This cupboard is filled with Ameesha’s Birkin bags.” Considered one of the most prestigious brands globally, a Birkin bag can be priced as high as Rs 2-3 crore.Detailed inventory keeps track of her collectionInside the cupboard, the actor has neatly placed a detailed list that organizes the bags by each shelf. One section of the list reads: “Shelf 7: Hermes Yellow Evelyn, Hermes Baby Pink Evelyn, Hermes Fuschia Pink Evelyn, Hermes Orange Evelyn, Hermes Powder Blue Evelyn, Hermes Mini Red Evelyn, Hermes Mini White Evelyn, Dior Denim Saddle Bag, Fendi Phone Case, LV Phone Case.”Saint Laurent bag captivates Farah KhanThe actress carefully took out a Saint Laurent bag from its protective cover to show Farah. Seeing it, the filmmaker was visibly impressed and sighed, “This is a bag I have wanted for so long ever and ever but it is…” before making a facial expression that hinted it was beyond her budget.Rare Bottega Veneta bags steal the spotlightNext, they chose a bag from Bottega Veneta. As Farah unwrapped it, she told the viewers, “This is one of the most expensive brands in the world: Bottega Veneta.” She revealed an orange bag, commenting, “This is a rare one I am seeing.” Ameesha chimed in, “This is a little traditional colour.” Farah agreed, “Yeah, exactly why I have never even seen it.” Then Ameesha showcased another bag from the same brand and style in black, saying, “This is a little classic, this is Black.” With a smile, Ameesha joked, “If I didn’t have a habit of collecting bags, I would have been owning a penthouse in Mumbai,” referring to the high value of her collection.Playful banter about marriage and bagsNext, she revealed another bag from Bottega Veneta. Farah couldn’t help but joke, “I think you should marry Karan Johar.” Ameesha responded, “I think so too. We want to be single so it is an ideal relationship.” As Ameesha displayed her Andiamo Large Tote, Farah admired it as “gorgeous” and teased, “Don’t show this to Dilip, he will simply use it to buy vegetables.” Ameesha then laughed, explaining how people often poke fun at her for carrying such big bags. “They say, ‘These bags are bigger and heavier than you, so you use them for veggies only,’” she shared. Farah agreed, “This is very heavy.” Ameesha added, “Yeah, and it gets heavier when I add stuff in it.” The price tag on this bag is upwards of ₹5,80,000."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

The fan wrote, “I don’t know why no one has noticed it yet, but something has happened to Honey Singh. For the past two years, he was looking so glamorous, but in some of his recent posts and stories, it seems like something has happened to his nose.

Big Clash, Small Payoff: No one’s a winner !

'Coolie' suffered from a weak screenplay and recycled tropes, while 'War 2' lacked a gripping emotional core. The clash highlighted the importance of storytelling over hype, leaving both films bruised at the box office. Rajinikanth's 'Coolie' and Hrithik Roshan's 'War 2' faced off, but both films underperformed despite strong openings. 'Coolie' suffered from a weak screenplay and recycled tropes, while 'War 2' lacked a gripping emotional core. The clash highlighted the importance of storytelling over hype, leaving both films bruised at the box office. When the release dates of Rajinikanth’s Coolie and Hrithik Roshan’s War 2 were locked for the same extended weekend, trade analysts, exhibitors, and fans braced themselves for what was billed as the “clash of the year.” The two films carried enormous weight on their shoulders: Coolie promised to be another mass masala entertainer led by the Rajinikanth himself collaborating with hit machine Lokesh Kanagaraj while War 2 was touted as Bollywood’s big-ticket spy-universe spectacle headlined by Hrithik Roshan with Jr NTR joining him to provide the south push.Yet, four days after their release, the numbers tell a different story. Both films have managed strong openings but are nowhere near the benchmarks their makers and fans had hoped for. The Numbers So FarIn India, Coolie collected Rs 65 crore on Day 1 (Thursday), primarily driven by Tamil Nadu and Telugu markets. Day 2 dropped to Rs 54.75 crore, followed by Rs 39.5 crore on Saturday and Rs 35 crore on Sunday. That brings its four-day total to aroundRs 194.25 crore net across languages.PollWhich film do you think had a stronger opening at the box office?CoolieWar 2War 2, on the other hand, opened lower with Rs 52 crore on Day 1. It managed to inch higher on Day 2 with Rs 57.35 crore, before sliding sharply to Rs 33.25 crore on Saturday andRs 31 crore (early estimates) on Sunday. Its four-day total stands atRs 173.6 crore net across languages with Hindi version contributing over Rs 125 crore.Overseas, the story isn’t drastically different. In North America, Coolie minted around USD 6 million in four days, while War 2 collected USD 3 million. For two films that were marketed as pan-India and global tentpoles, these numbers, while healthy in isolation, do not reflect the earth-shattering dominance one would expect from such heavyweight titles.The real problem both films face isn’t the clash , it is the content itself.Rajinikanth’s Coolie was designed as a throwback to the larger-than-life masala entertainers that made him a superstar. The trailers promised punch dialogues, exaggerated action, and whistle-worthy swagger. The first day’s collections indicated that fans turned out in droves.But as the weekend wore on, the word of mouth began to dip. Audiences complained about a weak screenplay, recycled tropes, and lack of emotional depth. Rajinikanth’s charisma remained intact, but the film offered little beyond his screen presence. Younger audiences, especially in metros, found the film dated, while family audiences felt the emotional core was missing.On the other hand, War 2 had the baggage of carrying forward the Spy Universe after Pathaan and Tiger. Expectations were sky-high, especially with Hrithik Roshan reprising his Kabir role and NTR Jr joining as the antagonist. The fans called out the film for its flimsy writing, incoherent arcs,not up to the mark VFX and a predictable storyline.The problem here wasn’t the lack of spectacle but the absence of a gripping emotional anchor. The film felt like a series of set pieces stitched together rather than a cohesive narrative.When two big-ticket films release on the same day, cannibalization is inevitable. Screens get divided, shows overlap, and audiences—especially in multiplexes—are forced to choose one over the other.In this case, Coolie dominated the South Indian markets, while War 2 enjoyed better traction in North India.The Burden of ExpectationBoth films also became victims of their own hype.Coolie was marketed as Rajinikanth’s grand return after the super success of JailerThe teaser broke records, the songs trended across social media, and fan clubs went all out with promotions. But when the film delivered more of the same old formula, audiences felt shortchanged.War 2, meanwhile, was positioned as a chapter in India’s first “spy universe.” The inclusion of NTR Jr was supposed to attract Southern audiences, while Hrithik’s return was meant to fuel nationwide frenzy. However, the film’s writing simply didn’t match the monumental expectations it carried.Mixed Word of MouthAnother critical factor has been the mixed word of mouth.Coolie has strong appeal among Rajinikanth loyalists, ensuring single-screen crowds remain energetic, but urban audiences are lukewarm.War 2 is attracting footfalls for its action spectacle, but its inconsistent pacing is putting off repeat viewership.The Road AheadFor Coolie, the hope lies in South Indian markets, where Rajinikanth’s pull remains unmatched. The film may stabilize at lower levels but still post healthy lifetime numbers due to fan loyalty.For War 2, the Hindi belt will be crucial. If word of mouth steadies and the weekday drops aren’t too steep, the film can still salvage its run, though crossing Rs 300 crore net in India a figure once expected now looks improbable despite having no new films releasing till 29th August.In the end, the much-hyped Coolie vs War 2 clash has proven to be a lose-lose situation. Instead of creating fireworks at the box office, the battle has highlighted the fragility of films that lean too heavily on hype and star power while neglecting storytelling.Both Rajinikanth and Hrithik Roshan remain massive crowd-pullers, and both films will recover costs thanks to pre-sales, digital, and satellite deals. But in terms of theatrical impact, neither will go down as the historic blockbuster their makers envisioned. Sometimes, two giants colliding doesn’t create a spectacle; it simply leaves both bruised."Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Adding to the drama, ex-boyfriend Utsav Dahiya accuses Apoorva of cheating and using their relationship for content.  After the India’s Got Latent controversy settled, influencer Apoorva Mukhija found herself in the spotlight once again with her stint on Karan Johar’s reality show The Traitors. On the show, she was often discussed alongside fellow content creator Sufi Motiwala. But now, Sufi has publicly declared that he and Apoorva are no longer friends, citing her lack of support when he was targeted by trolls from her audience.In an Instagram story, Sufi clarified, “No more lies. I’ve received a lot of texts saying that I’ve taken clout from Apoorva and I’ve left her. I’ve literally never collaborated on a reel with her and have been on her YouTube twice, both of which were her content pieces entirely. So no I’m not sorry I didn’t use her for clout (incase u forgot we were on the same show without knowing each other I don’t need her clout) I wanted to be friends with Apoorva not the rebel kid when there was no accountability constantly for how I was being treated I distanced myself.”Uorfi Javed vs Apoorva Mukhija: ‘The Traitors’ Reality Show Fight Gets UGLYWhile Sufi distanced himself, Apoorva’s ex-boyfriend Utsav Dahiya also took to Instagram with a sharp takedown of the influencer. In a recent post, Utsav accused her of cheating, even sharing a song in which he called her out, alleging that she wanted to reconcile purely for “content.” He also claimed that Apoorva used the word “ghatiya” for him only to boost social media engagement.Part of his caption read: “Ab agar koi aur bakwaas kari toh main seedha receipts nikalunga. Never try to gain sympathy by fabricating lies or pushing false narratives just to make content and assassinate someone’s character online. Having a big following doesn’t give you the right to bully your way by rage-baiting your audience and unleashing them on others.”Utsav further alleged that Apoorva and her team dismissed his concerns when he was being trolled due to her accusations: “When I was being falsely painted as a cheat and an abuser because of things you said, I reached out to you and your agency, hoping to find a way to deal with the hate. Instead, I was told, ‘You’re a nobody, you should be happy you got to date her.’ So here’s a message from that ‘nobody’: you tried your level best (and I won’t lie, it wasn’t easy), but I’m still here, still standing. That should tell you something: your big numbers only matter on an app. There’s a real and much bigger world outside, beyond lies and kalesh.”He concluded by saying, "Truth doesn't need 'followers', it stands on its own. Toh tum chalao apna ghar kalesh se, but kisi ke baare mein jhoot bolna band karo. Baki logo ko life mein dhanke kaam karne do. Grow up, kid. (and here's a rhyme for you that might be more up your speed .... in case it helps)" With his caption, he sang a song dedicated to her which also hinted at their story. Apoorva and Utsav had announced their breakup earlier this year in January. Since then, she has repeatedly hinted at him in her content, accusing him of cheating and abuse without taking his name directly. In his latest post too, Utsav avoided naming her, but the message left little doubt for followers about whom he was addressing."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Earlier this summer, they attended Jeff Bezos' wedding celebrations. Ceretti spoke about the pressures of dating someone famous. The couple has kept their relationship mostly private.  Oscar-winning actor Leonardo DiCaprio, 50, and Italian model Vittoria Ceretti, 27, were spotted enjoying a romantic yacht trip off the coast of Formentera, Spain. On Friday, August 15, the pair shared a kiss while relaxing on board, giving fans a rare glimpse of their private romance. Sun, sea and a little PDAAccording to the pictures and videos published by Daily Mail, the couple clearly made the most of their Mediterranean getaway. They lounged on the yacht, took dips in the sparkling blue waters, and mingled with friends on board. At one sweet moment, Ceretti placed her hand on DiCaprio’s back as they climbed the yacht stairs together. A relaxed day in the sun turned into a picture-perfect PDA moment.Rare public appearance sparks excitementThough linked since August 2023, DiCaprio and Ceretti are rarely seen together in public. Their yacht outing gave fans a rare and intimate look at a love that has stayed mostly under wraps.Jet-setting lovebirdsThe couple seems to share a love for travel and luxury trips. Earlier this summer, they were spotted at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez’s wedding celebrations in Venice. On June 26, they were photographed leaving the Gritti Palace Hotel before the wedding welcome party. DiCaprio was effortlessly sharp in a dark suit and cap, while Ceretti looked chic in a long neutral dress with stitching details, a stylish updo, and a nude clutch bag.Ceretti opens up about high-profile loveEarlier this year, Ceretti spoke for the first time about dating someone famous in Vogue France. While she didn’t name DiCaprio directly, the magazine called him a “very, very famous actor.”The model said they first met in Milan but didn’t share more details. She also reflected on the pressures of dating in the spotlight. “As soon as you're in a relationship with someone who has a larger following than you, you become 'girlfriend of', or 'boyfriend of,' for that matter. And that can be extremely annoying,” she told Vogue France.Labels can be limitingCeretti added, “Suddenly, people are talking about you as so-and-so's girlfriend who was so-and-so's ex. So, it's not nice to think that you can't love whoever you want, because of the labels people need to stick on you.”Yet, she said love can rise above all the noise. “If what you're experiencing is real, if you know you love each other, then there's no reason to be alarmed. Because love protects and gives confidence."Since their romance became public, DiCaprio and Ceretti have kept things mostly private but have been spotted together at a few events and trips.

Despite this, she has achieved significant success, including an Ivor Novello Award, while openly addressing body image and mental health. Canal's resilience shines through her music and advocacy.  TRIGGER WARNING: This article includes references to sexual abuseVictoria Canal, a Spanish-American singer and songwriter, has courageously revealed that she was groomed and abused by a “very powerful, decades-older man” early in her career. In a heartfelt Instagram post, she shared how the abuse lasted over a year and how she was manipulated into silence, being told that speaking out would end her career before it had even begun.Victoria Canal UNMASKS ‘POWERFUL’ ABUSER; 'June Baby' Star Exposes Grooming HorrorBeyond this revelation, Canal has been open about her life and challenges. Born with a congenital condition, she refuses to be defined by it. According to a Prime Timer report, Canal was born without the lower half of her right arm. She has compared it to something as ordinary as having “an unlucky-shaped nose” and insists she does not want to be boxed as ‘the one-armed singer’ like Stevie Wonder, who is not solely defined by blindness.Her unique perspective has shaped her music. Canal learned to play piano without her right hand, developing special chord voicings and creative techniques that are central to her songwriting.Global upbringing shaped her early careerAs reported by Hindustan Times, she was born in Munich and raised across the globe. Canal often communicated online due to her family’s nomadic lifestyle. Her breakthrough came through Instagram, where short clips of her performances caught the attention of artists like Michael Franti and Emily King, who later invited her on tour.Since then, Canal has shared stages with major acts, fronted Nike’s Jordan FlyEase campaign, and in 2024, she won the prestigious Ivor Novello Award in the UK for songwriting. Her music is known for its honesty and vulnerability, exploring themes of body image, identity, and resilience.Shocking abuse allegations revealed publiclyEarlier this month, Canal revealed in an Instagram post that early in her career she was groomed and abused by a “very powerful, decades-older man” who had offered her first professional break. She described how she was manipulated into silence by the abuser, who made her believe that no one else wanted her. Canal wrote that she was told speaking about the abuse would end her career before it had even begun, according to Music Ally.Victoria said the experience, which lasted just over a year, has had a lasting effect on her intimate life. Sharing her truth, she explained, was part of her healing journey. Although she did not name her alleged abuser, speculation online suggested it could be musician Michael Franti. ETimes cannot independently verify this.Reclaiming power through honestyFor Canal, speaking openly about abuse is part of reclaiming her power, just like her previous disclosures about body image and mental health. She shared a strong message to her fans,“Whatever you look like, whatever you are feeling, you are accepted, you are enough. You are more than enough.”DISCLAIMER: If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, assault, or abuse, please seek immediate help.

After a long 3-month wait, fans of Tom Cruise's latest action-adventure film, 'Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning' is set for its digital debut.According to the latest reports, 'The Final Reckoning', said to be the last film in the MI franchise, will make its digital debut on Tuesday, August 19, 2025.

Sufi revealed he cut ties because he felt Apoorva didn't address her fans' abuse towards him. He clarified he didn't use her for clout, wanting genuine friendship, not dealing with constant mistreatment without accountability.  With the way things unfolded during and after ‘The Traitors,’ it seemed like the entertainment industry was ready to find new BFFs in Sufi Motiwala and Arpoorva Mukhija. However, just when the audience was starting to cherish their bond, their friendship ended. Sufi Motiwala took to his social media handle to clear the air around their bond and say that he has cut ties with Apoorva. In his words, he wanted to be friends with Apoorva Mukhija and not Rebel Kid.Read on to know what Sufi Motiwala has to say on his broken bond with Apoorva MukhijaSufi Motiwala breaks his silence on his ‘not friends anymore’ status with Apoorva Mukhija“No more lies. I’ve received a lot of texts saying that I’ve taken clout from Apoorva, and I’ve left her. I’ve literally never collaborated on a reel with her and have been on her YouTube twice, both of which were her content pieces entirely," wrote Sufi before adding, “So no I’m not sorry I didn’t use her for clout (incase u forgot we were on the same show without knowing each other I don’t need her clout) I wanted to be friends with Apoorva not the rebel kid when there was no accountability constantly for how I was being treated I distanced myself."He shared that despite his request to Apoorva to make her fans understand not to slam him, he got no response from her. “I even requested her to ask her audience to calm down because they’ve been abusing me for no reason. Sadly, this person who called me her best friend has no concern for that, or the fact that maybe I’m hurt. THAT is why I’m not friends with her anymore. Keep it cute, keep it moving."“Idc about anything u think I’m a horrible person, ok. But I have worked my a** off to build myself to where I am, and I won’t let a bunch of children discredit that by spreading misinformation," he concluded.Sufi and Apoorva formed a strong friendship during the shoot of ‘The Traitors,’ which fans on the internet embraced. However, keen observers noted that the two have stopped mentioning each other on social media, despite attending the same events, including one in Australia. Reportedly, Sufi has unfollowed Apoorva on Instagram.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

He stated that verifying historical claims isn't his responsibility. Chatterjee also mentioned his unawareness of the film's title change and director Vivek Agnihotri claimed the trailer launch was halted due to lack of permission.  'The Bengal Files,' directed by Vivek Agnihotri, has been in the news due to a controversy surrounding its historical accuracy, which reportedly led to the cancellation of its trailer launch in Kolkata. Amid the debate, actor Saswata Chatterjee has distanced himself from the film, stating he is an actor, not a historian, and is therefore not qualified to verify the story's historical claims.Read on to learn more about what the actor has to say about 'The Bengal Files.'Sawasta Chatterjee distances himself from ‘The Bengal Files’ controversyIn his recent interview with The Wall, the actor stated that he simply played a character he liked and that it is not his responsibility as an actor to verify historical accuracy. He added that if others believe the film distorts history or belittles Bengal, they should take legal action instead of just creating a fuss."I liked a character and I played it. I am not a historian to think about what history says, and this is distorting history. It's not my job. If those whose job it is feel that Bengal is being belittled, then they can go to court with the information. There is no point in just making noise," Chatterjee said. Further distancing himself from the controversy, the actor added, “Let me tell you this. Nowadays, it's a trend; the whole story won't be told to anyone. You only get to know your track, your character. And when I was told about the role, I found the character to be amazing. It's a villain's character, and very few people get such characters to play."Sawasta Chatterjee claims he had no idea about the title changeSaswata Chatterjee stated that he was unaware of the change in the film's title from 'Delhi Files' to 'The Bengal Files.' He mentioned that the name change was decided after filming was completed and was not within his control. He said he would not understand the reason behind the change until he saw the movie."I will not understand why it happened till I watch the film. And even if anyone thinks that...making a noise will not help," Chatterjee remarked.‘The Bengal Files’ trailer launch rowDirector Vivek Agnihotri claimed that the trailer launch of his movie was halted on Saturday. Amid his claims, a senior police officer told NDTV that Agnihotri didn’t have the required permission for the screening; thus, he violated the law. About 'The Bengal Files''The Bengal Files' is an upcoming film directed by Vivek Agnihotri and marks the final part of his 'Files Trilogy' about modern Indian history. Following his earlier films, 'The Tashkent Files' (2019) and 'The Kashmir Files' (2022), this movie focuses on the events of the 1946 Great Calcutta killings.
