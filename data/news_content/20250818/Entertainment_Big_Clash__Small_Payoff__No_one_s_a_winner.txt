Rajinikanth's 'Coolie' and Hrithik Roshan's 'War 2' faced off, but both films underperformed despite strong openings. 'Coolie' suffered from a weak screenplay and recycled tropes, while 'War 2' lacked a gripping emotional core. The clash highlighted the importance of storytelling over hype, leaving both films bruised at the box office. When the release dates of Rajinikanth’s Coolie and Hrithik Roshan’s War 2 were locked for the same extended weekend, trade analysts, exhibitors, and fans braced themselves for what was billed as the “clash of the year.” The two films carried enormous weight on their shoulders: Coolie promised to be another mass masala entertainer led by the Rajinikanth himself collaborating with hit machine Lokesh Kanagaraj while War 2 was touted as Bollywood’s big-ticket spy-universe spectacle headlined by Hrithik Roshan with Jr NTR joining him to provide the south push.Yet, four days after their release, the numbers tell a different story. Both films have managed strong openings but are nowhere near the benchmarks their makers and fans had hoped for. The Numbers So FarIn India, Coolie collected Rs 65 crore on Day 1 (Thursday), primarily driven by Tamil Nadu and Telugu markets. Day 2 dropped to Rs 54.75 crore, followed by Rs 39.5 crore on Saturday and Rs 35 crore on Sunday. That brings its four-day total to aroundRs 194.25 crore net across languages.PollWhich film do you think had a stronger opening at the box office?CoolieWar 2War 2, on the other hand, opened lower with Rs 52 crore on Day 1. It managed to inch higher on Day 2 with Rs 57.35 crore, before sliding sharply to Rs 33.25 crore on Saturday andRs 31 crore (early estimates) on Sunday. Its four-day total stands atRs 173.6 crore net across languages with Hindi version contributing over Rs 125 crore.Overseas, the story isn’t drastically different. In North America, Coolie minted around USD 6 million in four days, while War 2 collected USD 3 million. For two films that were marketed as pan-India and global tentpoles, these numbers, while healthy in isolation, do not reflect the earth-shattering dominance one would expect from such heavyweight titles.The real problem both films face isn’t the clash , it is the content itself.Rajinikanth’s Coolie was designed as a throwback to the larger-than-life masala entertainers that made him a superstar. The trailers promised punch dialogues, exaggerated action, and whistle-worthy swagger. The first day’s collections indicated that fans turned out in droves.But as the weekend wore on, the word of mouth began to dip. Audiences complained about a weak screenplay, recycled tropes, and lack of emotional depth. Rajinikanth’s charisma remained intact, but the film offered little beyond his screen presence. Younger audiences, especially in metros, found the film dated, while family audiences felt the emotional core was missing.On the other hand, War 2 had the baggage of carrying forward the Spy Universe after Pathaan and Tiger. Expectations were sky-high, especially with Hrithik Roshan reprising his Kabir role and NTR Jr joining as the antagonist. The fans called out the film for its flimsy writing, incoherent arcs,not up to the mark VFX and a predictable storyline.The problem here wasn’t the lack of spectacle but the absence of a gripping emotional anchor. The film felt like a series of set pieces stitched together rather than a cohesive narrative.When two big-ticket films release on the same day, cannibalization is inevitable. Screens get divided, shows overlap, and audiences—especially in multiplexes—are forced to choose one over the other.In this case, Coolie dominated the South Indian markets, while War 2 enjoyed better traction in North India.The Burden of ExpectationBoth films also became victims of their own hype.Coolie was marketed as Rajinikanth’s grand return after the super success of JailerThe teaser broke records, the songs trended across social media, and fan clubs went all out with promotions. But when the film delivered more of the same old formula, audiences felt shortchanged.War 2, meanwhile, was positioned as a chapter in India’s first “spy universe.” The inclusion of NTR Jr was supposed to attract Southern audiences, while Hrithik’s return was meant to fuel nationwide frenzy. However, the film’s writing simply didn’t match the monumental expectations it carried.Mixed Word of MouthAnother critical factor has been the mixed word of mouth.Coolie has strong appeal among Rajinikanth loyalists, ensuring single-screen crowds remain energetic, but urban audiences are lukewarm.War 2 is attracting footfalls for its action spectacle, but its inconsistent pacing is putting off repeat viewership.The Road AheadFor Coolie, the hope lies in South Indian markets, where Rajinikanth’s pull remains unmatched. The film may stabilize at lower levels but still post healthy lifetime numbers due to fan loyalty.For War 2, the Hindi belt will be crucial. If word of mouth steadies and the weekday drops aren’t too steep, the film can still salvage its run, though crossing Rs 300 crore net in India a figure once expected now looks improbable despite having no new films releasing till 29th August.In the end, the much-hyped Coolie vs War 2 clash has proven to be a lose-lose situation. Instead of creating fireworks at the box office, the battle has highlighted the fragility of films that lean too heavily on hype and star power while neglecting storytelling.Both Rajinikanth and Hrithik Roshan remain massive crowd-pullers, and both films will recover costs thanks to pre-sales, digital, and satellite deals. But in terms of theatrical impact, neither will go down as the historic blockbuster their makers envisioned. Sometimes, two giants colliding doesn’t create a spectacle; it simply leaves both bruised."Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
