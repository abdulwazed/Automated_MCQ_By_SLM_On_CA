Backed by strategic infrastructure initiatives from the Ministry of Transport, Communications, and Information Technology, these gains underline the growing capacity and efficiency of the country’s maritime logistics sector.Surge in container handling and cargo throughputContainer activity at Oman’s three major ports — Salalah, Sohar, and Duqm — rose significantly in the first six months of 2025. According to the Ministry of Transport, Communications, and Information Technology, a total of 2,427,195 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) were handled during this period. This marks an 11.7% increase compared to the 2,173,508 TEUs managed in the same timeframe of 2024.In tandem, the overall volume of goods handled by Omani ports also grew. Ports collectively processed 70,114,527 tonnes of cargo from January to June 2025, compared to 66,620,847 tonnes in the corresponding period last year — a 5.2% increase. The rise highlights both the enhanced logistics capacity and the growing demand across Oman’s key port hubs.Higher ship arrivals at key portsShip traffic to and through Oman also saw notable growth. During the first half of 2025, 6,586 ships arrived at Omani ports and marine docks outside port facilities. This reflects an 11.1% growth compared to the 5,930 vessels recorded in the same period of 2024.Several key ports were primary contributors to this upward trend. Among them:Sultan Qaboos PortShinas PortPort of SalalahThese ports played a central role in absorbing the increased maritime activity and accommodating the expanded flow of vessels into the country.Growth in vehicle and livestock importsBeyond containers and cargo, Omani ports also saw an uptick in other import categories. In the first half of 2025:50,248 vehicles were received through the ports.2,694,293 heads of livestock were imported.These figures underscore the ports' importance not just for trade and industry, but also for meeting diverse economic and commercial needs ranging from the automotive sector to food supply chains.Strategic port infrastructure initiatives underwayTo sustain and support this growth, the Ministry of Transport, Communications, and Information Technology has advanced several infrastructure projects aimed at enhancing port capabilities and maritime readiness.Key developments include:Awarding of consultancy services for the design and supervision of development works at Khor Jarama, which will bolster maritime utility and preparedness at the site.Tender awards for the rehabilitation of Shannah Port and Masirah Port, intended to modernise and upgrade these facilities for improved service delivery and operational resilience.These efforts reflect the Ministry’s ongoing commitment to ensuring Oman's ports remain competitive, efficient, and equipped for future demand.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
