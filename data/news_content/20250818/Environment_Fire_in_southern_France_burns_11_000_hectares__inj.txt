The blaze, which started on Tuesday afternoon, is still threatening several villages in the aude department, where 1,500 firefighters have been battling to extinguish it."The fire is advancing in an area where all the conditions are ripe for it to progress. We are monitoring the edges and the back of the fire to prevent flare-ups," said Lucie Roesch, secretary general of the qude prefecture.She said firefighters are expecting to receive aerial support at dawn, but warned "this fire will keep us busy for several days. It's a long-term operation".The fire's advance slowed overnight due to high humidity levels, she added.One person was seriously burned and another injured, the prefecture said, adding that seven firefighters were also hurt. Camping grounds and one village were partially evacuated, and several local roads have been closed."All of the Nation's resources are mobilised," French president Emmanuel Macron said on X, while calling on people to exercise "the utmost caution".The qude department has seen an increase in areas burnt in recent years, aggravated by low rainfall and the removal of vineyards, which used to help break the progression of fires.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle10 baby names that mean creativity and visionLifestyleWhen looks can be deceptive: 10 ‘PRETTY’ killers in the animal worldLifestyleBirthday Special: Spine-chilling quotes of Alfred Hitchcock that will keep you up at nightLifestyleSet up a mini lotus pond at home with these easy tipsLifestyleAttractive looks of Srithika Saneeshtv10 creatures that can walk on waterLifestyleSheet masks out, Kareena Kapoor Khan’s DIY napkin mask inLifestyleBhagyashri Borse charms with her gorgeous outfitsEntertainmentMost affordable diesel cars under Rs 12 lakh: Kia Syros, Mahindra Thar and moreauto Next123 Photostories  6 lizards that prove reptiles can be adorableHow to unrot your brain: 5 effective steps to sharpen focus and boost mental clarityFrom Mullum Malarum to Kabali: Rajinikanth’s most emotional movies that fans still cherishLegends reborn – Bollywood actors who came back strongKyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi 2: Smriti Irani, Amar Upadhyay and other stars' educational qualificationGreen, pink and purple — jaw-dropping Northern Lights photos you won’t believe are realFrom Munshi Ranjeet to David John: Bigg Boss Malayalam contestants who faced first-week evictionAdorable baby shower photos of Bigg Boss Telugu fame Soniya'RRR,' 'Kaalapani,' and 'Major': South Indian films that celebrate IndiaNayanthara's classic films to watch123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillJessica RadcliffeLebron JamesBasanti ChatterjeePatrick MahomesGautam AdaniElon MuskIndia Nayara EnergyCJI GavaiBengaluru Student AttackTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteImmigration crackdown: Venezuelan civic groups sue Trump admin over termination of Temporary Protected Status; call it cruelty towards vulnerableFormer Platters band member Sandra Hall goes missing, last seen on Friday in Brooklyn; search under wayUAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed sends firefighting team to aid Albania’s wildfire battleRoad safety improves sharply in Kuwait: Accidents down 45%, deaths down 34% in first half of 2025Kuwait: No more minimum salary requirement for family visit visas, what expats need to knowTurkish Airlines and Oman Air frequent flyer partnership: Travelers can now earn miles across both airlines‘Take our capital back’: Nearly 800 troops deployed by Donald Trump arrive at DC; 23 individuals arrested overnightBahrain stands tall: Ranks 3rd in Arab region in new UN Human Development reportUAE: What is Abu Dhabi's ‘Hayat’ program?
