AI image A shooting incident in Tremonton, Utah, left at least three police officers injured on Sunday night after a suspect opened fire during a disturbance call. The Brigham City Police Department, which is handling public information on the case, confirmed that the suspect fired at officers responding to the scene near 700 North and 200 East, close to North Park Elementary School, around 9:30 pm (local time), according to Fox 13 Now.Detective Crystal Beck of Brigham City Police told reporters that three officers were shot and later taken to hospital for treatment, though their conditions remain unknown. She also explained that officers had called for backup during the confrontation but eventually stopped responding over their radios.The situation initially caused confusion after Tremonton Mayor Lyle Holmgren posted a statement on Facebook suggesting that two officers had died. Both the city and Holmgren later retracted the claim, with the mayor telling KSL TV’s Alex Cabrero that he could not confirm any details as the scene was still active.The shooting sparked a huge police response, with support from neighbouring law enforcement agencies. As per Newsweek, the suspect was eventually taken into custody and moved to Box Elder County Jail. Authorities confirmed there is no ongoing threat to the public, although residents were asked to stay away from the area. A temporary “shelter in place” order had been issued earlier in the night. Officials also said no civilians were hurt.A local resident, Randy Kidman, described his frightening experience when a stray bullet struck his car. “I thought there was somebody lighting off fireworks,” he was quoted as saying by Fox 13 Now. “I come up the road, and I saw two cop cars and something in the road, and decided it wasn’t a good situation. I went to go back out, and when I went to back out, I caught a bullet through the driver’s side door and it went out my windshield… It’s pretty freaky.”Reported scanner audio from Box Elder County is going viral on social media, which captured the tense exchanges between officers during the incident, including calls for SWAT support and reports of two officers down at the intersection near the school. However, the authenticity of the audio can’t be verified.The name of the suspect has not yet been released.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
