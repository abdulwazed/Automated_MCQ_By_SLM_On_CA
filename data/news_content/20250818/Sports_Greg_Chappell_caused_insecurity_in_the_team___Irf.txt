Irfan Pathan and Greg Chappell (Getty Images)  NEW DELHI: Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has opened up on Greg Chappell’s controversial stint as Team India’s head coach, offering a balanced view of the Australian’s methods. Pathan admitted that he personally benefited under Chappell, but also highlighted how the coach’s aggressive approach clashed with Indian cricketing culture, eventually contributing to a turbulent phase that included Sourav Ganguly’s removal as captain and India’s early exit from the 2007 ODI World Cup.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Pathan recalled how Chappell’s style created insecurity within the squad."He had his way of treating seniors and juniors with the same respect. But in that, he would be a bit more aggressive than one would like. He would tell anyone that if they don't perform, they will be dropped. I realised it was too aggressive, and once I talked to him privately about it," Pathan said on The Lallantop.IRFAN PATHAN FLYING FROM MUMBAI SPOTTED AT AIRPORT"I told him that we already know what you keep saying about being dropped. You don't need to tell us. It is causing insecurity in the team. He looked at me for a while, got a bit upset and threw some choicest of words, but then he realised I was right," he added.Pathan stressed that Chappell’s failure was not in intent but in cultural adaptation."If I go to Bangladesh or Sri Lanka or England as a coach, and if I don't accept their culture, would their players accept me? Greg Chappell's intention was right, but he wanted to bring an Australian culture. He wanted us to play hard cricket and didn't care what background anyone came from. But you can certainly do it in a much better way."Sharing his own county cricket experience, Pathan underlined why blending into a team’s environment is crucial."I played for Middlesex County club. You play a four-day match, then you drive the next day. They gather everyone in a bar before the match. I don't drink, but I need to accept their culture. You are a part of the team, and you need to blend in. If Chappell hadn't missed that one thing, he would've been one of the best coaches," he concluded.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
