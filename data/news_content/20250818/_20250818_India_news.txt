NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Monday met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in New Delhi and held a meeting. In his meeting with Wang, Jaishankar said that the differences must not become disputes between the two countries. "The fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations is another major priority. I look forward to our exchange of views. Overall, it is our expectation that our discussions would contribute to building a stable cooperative and forward-looking relationship between India and China, one that serves both our interests and addresses our concerns," Jaishankar said in the meeting. Jaishankar said that there will be a discussion on border issues between Wang Yi and Special Representative NSA Ajit Doval on Tuesday.

It is also essential that the de-escalation process move forward," he said."When the world's two largest nations meet, it is natural that the international situation will be discussed. We seek a fair, balanced and multipolar world order, including a multipolar Asia. Reform multilateralism is also the call of the day.

China shared confidence to dispel interference, expand cooperation and to further consolidate the momentum of improvement development of the relations, so that while pursuing the respective rejuvenation, Beijing can contribute to each other's success and provide the most needed certainty to Asia and the world. The meeting follows Doval’s December trip to Beijing for the 23rd round of talks, held weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed in Kazan to revive dialogue mechanisms during the BRICS summit.Wang's visit comes ahead of PM Modi's trip to China to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin from August 31 to September 1. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Wang’s visit reflects Beijing’s intent to implement understandings reached between the two leaders, maintain high-level exchanges, deepen political trust, expand cooperation, and properly manage differences to ensure stable development of bilateral ties. Mao described the SR-level dialogue as a crucial channel for advancing boundary negotiations. She noted that the previous round in Beijing produced agreements on delimitation, border management, and cross-border cooperation. Both sides, she said, have been working through diplomatic channels this year to implement those outcomes. Looking ahead, Mao said China is prepared to continue constructive engagement with India on the basis of existing consensus to jointly preserve peace and stability along the border.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Chaturvedi, part of a delegation highlighting India's anti-terrorism stance post-Operation Sindoor, emphasized representing the nation abroad despite being a vocal opposition member domestically. She also criticized the Election Commission of India, expressing concerns about eroding public trust and perceived bias towards the BJP.  NEW DELHI: A humorous moment of Shiv Sena (UBT) Rajya Sabha MP Priyanka Chaturvedi on a podcast brought Congress Lok Sabha MP Shashi Tharoor again into the limelight. During a podcast interview, Chaturvedi was questioned about posting pictures with Prime Minister Modi and public reactions. She quipped, “I sometimes love irritating people, because they are so invested in my life, where is she going next, where’s she going next?” Prakash responded by joking, “You’re basically Shashi Tharoor in a saree.” Chaturvedi laughed, saying, “I don’t know whether that is a compliment for Shashi or for me, but I am going to tell Shashi.”PollDo you think Priyanka Chaturvedi's comments about irritating people were humorous?Yes, very funnyNo, not funny at all The clip was later shared on X by Chaturvedi, prompting a witty reply from Tharoor: “Thanks Priyanka. I consider myself flattered either way.” Chaturvedi mentioned she first shared her picture with Narendra Modi on Instagram, which subsequently spread on X and other platforms. She recounted in a funny, imitating tone, “We had said she went on the Parliament delegation, and it happened there.” Chaturvedi was part of the Group-2 delegation led by BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad that visited European nations to highlight India’s stance against terrorism. The visit followed India’s Operation Sindoor, targeting terror infrastructures in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.When asked about representing India after Opertaion Sindoor, especially being in opposition, Chaturvedi said, "That I'm a very vocal member of the opposition when I'm in my country. But when I'm outside my country, I'm the ambassador for my nation." She also criticised the Election Commission of India (ECI), stating that public trust in the poll body is waning. “Day by day, new names are being added and removed from the rolls. Now, the system has been exposed. We have seen their press conference, and the language used was deeply unfortunate. Today, people no longer trust the Election Commission. The public will surely ask why their confidence is not being earned. It seems the Commission is focused only on winning the BJP’s trust,” Chaturvedi told ANI.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Tharoor emphasized the mission's invaluable contribution to Gaganyaan, citing hands-on experience, crucial data, and the testing of Indian systems.  NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Monday said the Opposition will not participate in the special discussion in the Lok Sabha on astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla’s space mission. However, Tharoor praised the achievement, calling it a landmark moment for India’s space ambitions replying to Kiren Rijiju's post on X urging discussion on Shubhanshu Shukla.“Since the Opposition are not participating in the special discussion, let me say how proud all Indians are of the recent mission of Commander Shubhanshu Shukla to the International Space Station (ISS). It served as a stepping stone to our nation's own human spaceflight program, Gaganyaan. Shukla's mission provided ISRO invaluable hands-on experience & data that cannot be replicated in simulations,” Tharoor wrote on X.He said Shukla’s first-hand observations on pre-launch procedures, spacecraft systems, and the psychological and physiological effects of microgravity were crucial for de-risking and refining the Gaganyaan mission. “The mission allowed for the testing of Indian systems & protocols in a real-life space environment. The numerous scientific experiments, including studies on human health in space and plant growth, provide technological and scientific validation which will directly help design the life-support and medical systems for Gaganyaan,” Tharoor added.The Congress MP also underscored the diplomatic impact of the mission. “Shukla's mission, conducted in partnership with international agencies, reinforced India's role in global space diplomacy. It demonstrates India's willingness and capability to engage in multilateral space efforts and opens doors for future joint research and investment,” he said.Tharoor concluded that the astronaut’s historic feat would inspire India’s youth. “Commander Shukla's historic flight serves as a powerful symbol of India's ambitions in human spaceflight. It has captured the nation's imagination, inspiring a new generation to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, maths and space studies — all essential for sustaining India's long-term space goals. Well done!”Union minister Kiren Rijiju meanwhile said the Lok Sabha would honour Shukla with a special discussion. “Our hero astronaut Capt Subhanshu Shukla has returned home after a successful mission to International Space Station. Parliament will honour him with a special discussion on his historic milestone and India’s growing space ambitions in our journey towards,” Rijiju wrote on X.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Concerns were raised about voter list irregularities in Maharashtra and Karnataka. Trinamool Congress leader Mahua Moitra called for dissolving the Lok Sabha. The opposition demands accountability from the Election Commission. Joint press conference by INDIA bloc leaders NEW DELHI: The INDIA bloc on Monday intensified its attack on the Election Commission, accusing it of misconduct in recent elections and questioning its decision to conduct a special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar just ahead of the state polls. Citing alleged irregularities in Maharashtra and Karnataka, leaders sharpened their criticism, with TMC’s Mahua Moitra even urging to "dissolve Lok Sabha immediately."The joint press conference, held at the Constitution Club of India, was attended by senior opposition leaders including Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi, SP’s Ramgopal Yadav, TMC’s Mahua Moitra, RJD’s Manoj Jha, AAP’s Sanjay Singh and others.Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi alleged that the EC failed to address serious concerns. "EC silent on voter additions in Maharashtra, discrepancies in rolls in Mahadevapura, video data deletion," he said. Gogoi further added, "EC in hands of officers who are taking sides, not probing any charges made by Opposition."PollDo you agree with the opposition's claim that the Election Commission is failing to address serious concerns?Yes, I agree.No, I disagree.At the presser, Congress leader said, "EC should first provide an affidavit that the voter list is clean, then we'll comply."Criticising the poll body’s recent actions, Gogoi remarked, "In its press conference yesterday, the EC (Election Commission) raised questions about the political parties when they had to explain why they were conducting SIR in a hurry. EC was silent on SIR in Bihar. They were also silent on how new 70 lakh voters were added between Lok Sabha and Maharashtra Assembly elections... It is clear that EC is under such officials who are not unbiased."TMC MP Mahua Moitra also raised concerns, saying, "West Bengal CM raised issue of duplicate EPIC voter cards, but issue not resolved." She went on to demand accountability, adding, "Action should be taken against past ECs for 'fraudulent' voter lists, dissolve Lok Sabha immediately."Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Arvind Sawant also hit out at the EC, saying, "The whimsical behaviour of the CEC made it seem like he was acting as a BJP spokesperson."About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The court has sought responses from the Centre and defense forces, exploring insurance coverage and enhanced ex-gratia payments for these cadets.  NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday sought response of the Centre and defence forces in a suo motu case on difficulties faced by cadets, who were medically discharged from military institutes on account of disabilities suffered during training programmes.A bench of Justices BV Nagarathna and R Mahadevan said the Centre should explore the possibility of granting an insurance cover to the cadets undergoing rigorous training in different military institutes to deal with any exigency of death or disabilities.The bench also asked Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for the Centre, to seek instruction on enhancing the Rs 40,000 ex-gratia amount granted to the cadets who get disabled during the training programme, to meet medical expenses.The top court also asked the Centre to explore a scheme for rehabilitation of these disabled candidates back into forces like desk jobs or any other work related to defence services, after their treatment is over."We want braveheart cadets to be in the forces. We don't want injuries or disability to be any kind of deterrent to these cadets, who undergo training after clearing various competitive examinations," the bench observed. It posted the matter for further hearing on September 4.The top court had registered on August 12 the suo motu case after a media report flagged the issue of these cadets, who were once part of training at the nation's top military institutes such as the National Defence Academy (NDA) and Indian Military Academy (IMA).According to the media report, there are around 500 officer cadets who have been medically discharged from these military institutes since 1985, due to varying degrees of disability incurred during training, and are now staring at mounting medical bills with an ex-gratia monthly payment that's far short of what they need.It said at the NDA alone, there are around 20 such cadets, who were medically discharged in just five years, between 2021 and July 2025.The media report further highlighted the plight of these cadets because as per rules, they are not entitled to the status of ex-servicemen (ESM), which would have made them eligible under the Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) for free treatment at military facilities and empanelled hospitals, since their disabilities took place during training before they were commissioned as officers.It had said that unlike soldiers in this category, who are entitled to ESM status, all that these officer cadets get now is an ex-gratia payment of up to Rs 40,000 per month depending on extent of disability - an amount that falls far short of basic needs.

We have not had any discussions (about impeachment) as of now, but if needed, we can do anything…”According to sources quoted by ANI, opposition parties may introduce an impeachment motion against Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar during the Monsoon Session.PollDo you support the idea of impeachment against Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar?Yes, it is necessaryNo, it is not warrantedThe remarks come after a row between Rahul Gandhi and the Election Commission over his allegations of “vote chori” in Karnataka. On Sunday, Gyanesh Kumar dismissed Rahul’s charges as “an insult” to the Constitution, asking him to either submit a signed affidavit or apologise within seven days. “An affidavit will have to be given or an apology should be made to the country. Teesra koi vikalp nahi (There is no third option),” Kumar said at a press conference in Delhi.Rahul Gandhi responded by questioning the poll body's impartiality, pointing to the BJP’s Anurag Thakur. “The Election Commission asks for an affidavit from me. But when Anurag Thakur says the same thing that I am saying, it does not ask for an affidavit from him,” he said. Congress leaders accused the CEC of sounding like a BJP spokesperson. Pawan Khera remarked, “It seemed like BJP was speaking today. Did he give any response about the 1 lakh voters we exposed in Mahadevapura?”Rahul Gandhi had earlier alleged large-scale irregularities in the Mahadevapura Assembly constituency, claiming that more than one lakh votes were “stolen” through duplicate and invalid entries. He also accused the poll body of “destroying evidence” by limiting CCTV footage storage to 45 days.While the CEC insisted that the Election Commission was standing “like a rock” with voters and dismissed the claims as baseless, opposition leaders from the RJD and JMM joined Congress in demanding clarity on Gandhi’s documents and allegations. The confrontation has deepened the stand-off between the Opposition and the poll body, now sharpened by Hussain’s suggestion that “all weapons of democracy” remain on the table.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The BJP nominated Radhakrishnan, currently the Governor of Maharashtra, aiming for a unanimous election. Prime Minister Modi lauded Radhakrishnan's dedication and intellect, highlighting his extensive community service. The vice-presidential election follows Jagdeep Dhankhar's resignation, with polling scheduled for September 9.  NEW DELHI: Janata Dal (united) president Nitish Kumar on Monday extended his party’s support to National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA) vice-presidential candidate, CP Radhakrishnan. In a post on X, Nitish Kumar said, “The decision to nominate Shri CP Radhakrishnan ji, the governor of Maharashtra, as the NDA’s candidate for Vice President is welcomed. JDU will support Shri CP Radhakrishnan ji. Best wishes to him.”The announcement came a day after the Bharatiya Janata Party declared Radhakrishnan as the NDA nominee. BJP president JP Nadda, after a meeting of the party’s Parliamentary Board, said the alliance aimed for a unanimous election. “We want next Vice-President to be elected unanimously, we have reached out to opposition leaders,” he said. He described Radhakrishnan as a respected statesman from Tamil Nadu.PollWhat qualities do you believe are most important for a Vice-President?Dedication and humility.Political experience.Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised the NDA pick, writing on X that Radhakrishnan’s “dedication, humility and intellect” would make him an inspiring Vice-President. “In his long years in public life, Thiru CP Radhakrishnan Ji has distinguished himself with his dedication, humility and intellect. During the various positions he has held, he has always focused on community service and empowering the marginalised. He has done extensive work at the grassroots in Tamil Nadu. I am glad that the NDA family has decided to nominate him as the Vice Presidential candidate of our alliance,” Modi said.He added, “Thiru CP Radhakrishnan Ji has rich experience as MP and Governor of various states. His Parliamentary interventions were always incisive. During his gubernatorial tenures, he focused on addressing challenges faced by common citizens. These experiences ensured that he has vast knowledge of legislative and Constitutional matters. I am confident he will be an inspiring Vice President.”Radhakrishnan is currently serving as the Governor of Maharashtra. He previously held gubernatorial responsibilities in Jharkhand, Telangana, and Puducherry. A veteran BJP leader, he has represented Coimbatore twice in the Lok Sabha and served as Tamil Nadu BJP president.The vice-presidential election was necessitated after former Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar resigned on July 21 citing health reasons. The opposition has claimed the move was linked to differences with the government.The Election Commission has scheduled polling for September 9, with counting of votes on the same day. The last date for filing nominations is August 21, while withdrawals are permitted until August 25. With its majority in Parliament, the NDA is seen as well placed to ensure Radhakrishnan’s victory, though the INDIA bloc is considering fielding a candidate.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

He was greeted by ministers, ISRO chairman, and space enthusiasts. Shukla is scheduled to meet PM Modi and participate in National Space Day celebrations, with Parliament set to discuss his mission and India's space program. Astronaut Subhanshu Shukla, along with astronaut Prashant Balakrishnan Nair, receives grand welcome from Union space minister Jitendra Singh, Delhi CM Rekha Gupta and and Isro chairman V Narayanan at the Delhi airport NEW DELHI: Following his historic mission to the International Space Station (ISS), Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla received a red-carpet welcome at Delhi’s IGI airport as he returned to the country from the US in the early hours of Sunday. Shukla, who piloted the spacecraft to the space station as part of the Axiom-4 mission, was welcomed by Union space minister Jitendra Singh, Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta and Isro chairman V Narayanan, and a large crowd of space enthusiasts at the airport.Posting on X later, minister Jitendra Singh said, “A moment of pride for India! A moment of glory for #ISRO! A moment of gratitude to the dispensation that facilitated this under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. India’s Space glory touches the Indian soil… as the iconic son of Mother India, Gaganyatri Shubhanshu Shukla lands at Delhi in the early hours of morning today. Accompanying him, another equally accomplished Group Captain Prasanth Balakrishnan Nair, one of the astronauts selected for India’s first Human mission Gaganyaan who was India’s designated backup for the mission to the ISS. Privileged to receive both of them”.Shukla is expected to meet PM Modi and then travel to his hometown Lucknow. He is likely to return to the Capital on Aug 22–23 to participate in the National Space Day celebrations.PollShould the Indian government invest more in space exploration?DefinitelyNo, we need to focus on other issuesThe Lok Sabha will hold a special discussion on Monday on India's space journey and Shukla's historic mission aboard the ISS, according to a notice issued by the lower House. The House will discuss “India's first astronaut aboard the ISS — critical role of space programme for Viksit Bharat by 2047”, which could possibly end the deadlock between the govt and opposition in Parliament over the electoral roll revision in Bihar.Earlier on Saturday, Shukla had posted a smiling photograph of himself on a flight and said he was filled with emotions. “As I sit on the plane to come back to India, I have a mix of emotions running through my heart. I feel sad leaving a fantastic group of people behind who were my friends and family for the past one year during this mission. I am also excited about meeting all my friends, family, and everyone in the country for the first time post mission. I guess this is what life is -- everything all at once," he said.In the 79th Independence Day speech at the Red Fort on Friday, PM Modi, while mentioning Group Captain Shukla’s successful mission to ISS, had said that India is working towards becoming self-reliant in the space sector and preparing for the launch of Gaganyaan, its indigenous human space flight mission, and is also working on developing its own space station.In June, Shukla became the second Indian to go to space — after IAF wing commander Rakesh Sharma in 1984— as part of the Axiom-4 mission to the ISS. During the 18-day mission, Shukla, along with astronauts Peggy Whitson (US), Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski (Poland), and Tibor Kapu (Hungary), conducted more than 60 experiments and 20 outreach sessions aboard the ISS. He returned to the Earth on July 16.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous8 best anti-ageing ingredients you should start using in your 20sLifestyle10 best vegetarian sources of IronLifestyleSalwar tales by gorgeous lady Shabana ShajahantvCars under Rs 6 lakh with six airbags: Maruti Alto, Nissan Magnite and moreautoKundali Bhagya fame Shraddha Arya’s stunning ethnic lookstvAnupama Parameswaran shines bright in striking snapsEntertainment'Coolie' actress Reba Monica John’s picture-perfect momentsEntertainmentMalavika Mohanan's stunning style moments you can't missEntertainmentJannat Zubair’s Gen-Z Style is Pure PerfectiontvEver heard of Flying fish?

Don't use 'not found suitable' tag to deny SC, ST teachers appointments, promotions: Parl panel
A parliamentary panel has strongly criticized the use of "Not Found Suitable (NFS)" to deny SC/ST teachers appointments and promotions, deeming it inappropriate and hurtful. The committee emphasized that there is no shortage of qualified SC/ST candidates and urged universities to judge applicants solely on academic merit.

The committee emphasized that there is no shortage of qualified SC/ST candidates and urged universities to judge applicants solely on academic merit. AI-generated image NEW DELHI: Touching a raw nerve among the deprived communities and champions of social justice, a key parliamentary panel said the "Not Found Suitable (NFS)" tag should not be used to deny SC and ST teachers opportunities in appointments and promotions, acknowledging the prevalence of the controversial practice while urging "better judgment" in recruitment of faculty members in universities.The Parliamentary Committee on SC/ST Welfare, while making the observation in context of a review of appointments in Delhi University, weighed in on a subject that has become a matter of wider concern. "While interacting with SC/ST teachers welfare association of DU, a glaring issue that came to fore was declaration of SC/ST teachers as 'NFS' for posts earmarked for them," it noted in a report tabled in the Parliament in its ongoing monsoon session."The committee vehemently condemns the usage of the term 'NFS' to deny eligible SC/ST teachers opportunities in appointments and promotions. The committee opines that declaring SC/ST candidates 'NFS' is not only inappropriate and hurts the sentiments of deserving, eligible and well qualified SC/ST candidates," the panel, headed by BJP MP Faggan Singh Kulaste, noted.The NFS debate revolves around allegations that authorities in educational institutions are manipulating fair employment opportunities for Dalits and tribals by dismissing candidatures as lacking suitability for faculty positions. Claiming large-scale vacancies against SC/ST quota in central universities, leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi recently blamed the governing BJP dispensation for 'NFS', which, he said, was being used to deny the marginalised communities leadership roles in education."NFS is the new Manuvaad now. Eligible candidates from SC/ST/OBC communities are being deliberately declared 'unsuitable' so that they are kept away from education and leadership," he had posted on social media, triggering strong backlash from BJP that accused Congress for marginalising the backward classes.Now, the parliamentary panel has said "in the present era there is no dearth of eligible SC/ST candidates holding impressive credentials in teaching fields. The committee recommend that SC/ST candidates applying for teaching posts should be judged solely on their academic prowess and that strict norms should not cloud the better judgement of selection panel."The panel urged that SC/ST candidates should be given ample opportunities and should be helped in achieving their professional goals.

The EC urged electors and political parties to utilize the remaining 15-day window to file claims and objections. New Delhi, Aug 17 (ANI): Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar addresses a press conference on Bihar Special Intensive Revision (SIR), at the National Media Centre in New Delhi on Sunday. (ANI Photo/Jitender Gupta) NEW DELHI: Stating that EC has uploaded the list of 65 lakh voters deleted from Bihar's draft electoral roll within 56 hours of SC's directive, CEC Gyanesh Kumar on Sunday exhorted electors and political parties in the state to file their claims and objections in the remaining 15-day timeframe, saying flagging any errors after Sept 1, shall be pointless.Justifying its decision to undertake SIR exercise in Bihar, EC said all the political parties had, for the past two decades, been demanding that imperfections in electoral roll be corrected. "Acting on this demand, EC decided to take up SIR, starting with Bihar," he told a press conference here, while adding that the timeline for SIR in other poll-bound states will be announced "at the appropriate time".Slamming the "vote theft" allegations levelled by opposition parties and their chiefs, EC said the electors, party representatives and booth level officers on the ground are working in a harmonious and transparent manner, endorsing the exercise with their signatures and video testimonials. "It is a matter of concern that endorsements of district presidents and booth level agents of parties are either not reaching their state level and national leadership, or the latter have chosen to overlook these, and are trying to spread misinformation," said Kumar.PollDo you think the public awareness about filing claims and objections regarding the electoral roll is sufficient?Yes, people are well-informedNo, more awareness is neededClearing the air on timing of SIR, the CEC said that since the annual summary revision was with respect to Jan 1, 2025, April 1 was too early to start the next revision, while Oct 1 would have been too close to the assembly poll due in Bihar in Nov. As regards allegations of hundreds and thousands of voters being registered on the same address, Kumar said in the absence of proper numbering of houses/addresses by the panchayats/municipalities and also the presence of unauthorised settlements, it has been an accepted norm for EC/BLO to register voters from notional addresses, often carrying 'zero' house number. Electoral roll excerpts shared by EC with TOI, of Assam in 1966, Rajasthan in 1980, UP in 1985, show their house number as either missing or as '01'.About the AuthorBharti JainBharti Jain is senior editor with The Times of India, New Delhi.
