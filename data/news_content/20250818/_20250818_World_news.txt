California Governor Gavin Newsom's office passed the buck on President Donald Trump on the issue of illegal alien Harjinder Singh who has been charged with vehicular homicide after his wrong U-turn killed three people in Florida. 35-year-old Harjinder, who is from India, has a commercial driver's license in Dem-ruled California that triggered a political slugfest with Republicans blaming Dem states of becoming the sanctuaries of illegal aliens. Newsom's office said Singh entered the US in 2018 when Trump was the president. Under California's law, one gets a commercial driver's license only when they have a lawful presence in the country, Newsom's office said.Deportation after criminal proceedingsThe video of Harjinder and a co-passenger inside the truck moments before taking the wrong turn went viral. The accident took place on August 12 near Fort Pierce on the Florida Turnpike when Singh turned his tractor-trailer through an "unauthorized location" which was meant of office use only. After the video went viral, it was found out that Singh entered the US illegally through the southern border in 2018. It's not clear how he managed a driver's license if he was an illegal alien. Singh faces three counts of vehicular homicide. Under Florida law, vehicular homicide is a second-degree felony, punishable by up to 15 years in prison. He faces deportation after criminal proceedings. California driver's license ruleCalifornia's Assembly Bill 60 (AB 60), enacted in 2015, allows undocumented immigrants to apply for a driver's license if they can provide proof of identity and California residency. These licenses are marked "not for federal identification.""This incident underscores the importance and urgency of the work that the Trump Administration is doing to audit CDL issuances nationwide, in addition to its enhanced enforcement of English-language proficiency—a fundamental requirement for operating commercial vehicles in interstate commerce," chief operation officer of American Trucking Association Dan Hovrath told Newsweek.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

He plans an executive order targeting voting machines and advocates for watermarked paper ballots, claiming they're faster and more reliable.  US President Donald Trump on Monday announced that he will lead a movement to end mail-in ballots and voting machines before the 2026 midterm elections, arguing they fuel "massive voter fraud" and erode trust in the electoral process.Sharing a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he plans to sign an executive order targeting what he called “highly inaccurate” and “controversial” voting machines, while pushing for a return to traditional paper ballots. He argued that traditional paper ballots with watermarks were faster, more reliable, and would leave “no doubt” about election outcomes."I am going to lead a movement to get rid of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, and also, while we’re at it, Highly “Inaccurate,” Very Expensive, and Seriously Controversial VOTING MACHINES, which cost Ten Times more than accurate and sophisticated Watermark Paper, which is faster, and leaves NO DOUBT, at the end of the evening, as to who WON, and who LOST, the Election," Trump posted."We are now the only Country in the World that uses Mail-In Voting. All others gave it up because of the MASSIVE VOTER FRAUD ENCOUNTERED. WE WILL BEGIN THIS EFFORT, WHICH WILL BE STRONGLY OPPOSED BY THE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THEY CHEAT AT LEVELS NEVER SEEN BEFORE, by signing an EXECUTIVE ORDER to help bring HONESTY to the 2026 Midterm Elections," he added.Trump further claimed that states act merely as “agents” of the federal government in counting and tabulating votes, insisting they must follow presidential directives “for the good of the country.” He accused Democrats of relying on mail-in voting to remain competitive, pointing to what he called their “radical left” policies on immigration, gender issues, and social reforms, which he argued made them “virtually unelectable without using this completely disproven mail-in scam.”“With their HORRIBLE Radical Left policies, like Open Borders, Men Playing in Women’s Sports, Transgender and “WOKE” for everyone, and so much more, Democrats are virtually Unelectable without using this completely disproven Mail-In SCAM,” he said. Trump further accused his rivals of relying on a “mail-in scam” to win saying, “Elections can never be honest with mail-in ballots or voting machines, and everybody knows it, especially the Democrats.”He added that restoring “honesty and integrity” to the election system would be a core Republican goal going into the midterms.What is mail-in voting? Mail-in voting allows voters to cast ballots by post. It includes absentee ballots, typically reserved for voters unable to reach polling stations due to illness, travel, or other valid reasons, and mail-in ballots, which in many states can be requested by any eligible voter without providing a reason.Mail-in ballot: The actual ballot paper that you fill out and send back by mail under the mail-in voting system.Why is Trump opposed to it?Although mail-in voting has long existed in the US, Trump has repeatedly attacked it since the 2020 presidential election, claiming it enables large-scale fraud. Despite these claims, election officials and courts have found no evidence of widespread fraud linked to mail-in voting.

They are aware that a meeting is taking place today in Washington that will address the end of the war,” Zelenskyy wrote on X. “The Russians are deliberately killing people, particularly children. Seven people have been killed as a result of the drone strike in Kharkiv, the youngest being a girl who is only a year and a half old. Dozens have been injured, including children.”Attacks across multiple regionsRussian strikes also targeted Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, the Sumy region, and Odesa, destroying residential buildings and critical infrastructure, as per the report by Reuters.In Zaporizhzhia, a Russian missile attack killed three people and wounded 20, with “many in critical condition,” according to regional governor Ivan Fedorov.Zelenskyy condemned a deliberate strike on an energy facility in Odesa belonging to Azerbaijan’s SOCAR company. “This implies that it was an attack not only on us but also on our relations and energy security,” he said.Diplomatic efforts and Washington talksZelenskyy is set to meet Trump in Washington to discuss key issues related to ending the conflict, alongside leaders from the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Finland, the EU, and Nato.“The Russian war machine continues to destroy lives despite everything. Putin will commit demonstrative killings to maintain pressure on Ukraine and Europe, as well as to humiliate diplomatic efforts,” Zelenskyy said. “That is precisely why we are seeking assistance to put an end to the killings. Reliable security guarantees are required. Russia should not be rewarded for its participation in this war. The war must be ended. And it is Moscow that must hear the word: ‘Stop.’”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

A 30-year-old Google software engineer, Surbhi Madan, shared her experience of being on an H-1B visa, though she calls the US her home since 2013, when she came to the country for her bachelor's at Brown University. In an interview with Business Insider on the highs and the lows of the big tech visa which is a bone of contention in the US politics now, the Indian-origin Google employee said how H-1B gave her so many opportunities in life but still her life in the US feels temporary -- because of H-1B. Madan was one of the luckiest to have received her H-1B visa in the lottery on her first try in 2017, but it was a different time, she said. Companies were hiring and willing to sponsor H-1B applications. Since then, Madan has been with Google and is now a senior software engineer. Now she want to pivot her career into teaching but H-1B does not allow her to do that. "I'm anxious about making mistakes when I drive or file taxes because I don't want anything to threaten my stay in the country. Because of the visa, my life in the US feels temporary," Madan said. "I have an option to renew my apartment lease for one or two years, and I always choose one year because I never know how long I'll be allowed to live in the US," she said. Sharing an experience of how US officials see legal immigrants, Madan said, once she was returning to the US after traveling abroad. At immigration, she was asked about her purpose of visit. "I live here," she told the officer. "You don't live here; you work here," the officer said, leaving an impact on her mind. The Trump administration is aiming to overhaul the H-1B system as the MAGA activists are advocating for scrapping of it. The new proposed rule will allow tech companies to hire foreign talents only for higher, high-wage positions.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Al Ain’s 2-1 win included three disallowed goals, the Pro League’s 9,000th goal, and sparked UAEFA’s warning on referee criticism/Image: X The UAE Football Association has issued a firm directive to clubs after Al Ain FC publicly questioned refereeing decisions in their season-opening win. The Association underscored that legal steps will be taken against any party undermining match officials, marking a decisive move to safeguard the integrity of Emirati referees.UAEFA takes a stand on referee criticismThe UAE Football Association (UAEFA) released a sharply worded statement warning clubs against challenging the competence or impartiality of match officials. The move follows comments made by Al Ain Football Club after their 2-1 win over Al Bataeh in the opening round of the 2024-25 ADNOC Pro League.According to the Association, any inappropriate public criticism of referees will lead to legal consequences. It emphasized that the authority for developing and overseeing the refereeing system lies solely with UAEFA and is managed through specialized committees and qualified professionals operating within structured frameworks.The statement also referenced a pattern of administrative missteps by Al Ain over the past two seasons. UAEFA said these were previously addressed with professionalism but added that it expects the club to focus on improving its internal processes and refrain from involving itself in areas outside its purview.Al Ain’s post match remarks spark controversyThe controversy began after Al Ain’s head coach, Vladimir Ivić, expressed frustration with the match officiating during his post-match press conference. The Serbian coach stated that his team had scored five times, with three goals disallowed. “For the first time in my career, I saw my team score five goals but the final result was 2-1. We definitely deserved more,” he said.The club also issued an official comment on its platforms, referring to “numerous controversial refereeing incidents” in the game. While affirming support for the domestic refereeing system, the club stated it “firmly rejects the continued occurrence of mistakes that could negatively affect the team’s results in domestic competitions.”In response, UAEFA criticized the tone and content of Al Ain's statements, highlighting the need for all clubs to uphold sportsmanship and show respect for the work of others in the football ecosystem.Legal consequences and available alternativesThe Association confirmed that legal action will be initiated against Al Ain FC and any other individual or entity that publicly undermines match officials. It reiterated that complaints about officiating must be handled through formal channels, not public statements.As an alternative for clubs dissatisfied with domestic referees, UAEFA noted that there is an established mechanism for requesting foreign match officials. This provision, however, must be used through the proper channels and approvals.Match highlights and milestones from Al Ain vs Al BataehOn the field, the match itself was notable beyond the controversy. Togolese striker Kodjo Fo-Doh Laba scored during first-half stoppage time, registering the 9,000th goal in ADNOC Pro League history — a significant milestone for the competition.Al Bataeh responded in the 69th minute with an equalizer from Uzbekistan international Azizjon Ganiev. However, Al Ain sealed their opening victory in the 82nd minute with a decisive header from Abdoul Karim Traoré.The match also marked the debut of Al Ain’s newly installed integrated cooling system at Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium. Over 300 air-conditioning units were operational to enhance fan comfort amid the UAE’s intense summer temperatures. Despite the off-field tensions, fans turned out in large numbers, with long queues at food outlets reflecting the growing attendance and engagement at league games.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The daily and monthly toll caps are being removed, leading to unlimited charges. Exemptions remain for specific groups, as these changes aim to reduce congestion and promote public transport use. Abu Dhabi will extend Darb road toll operating hours by an additional two hours daily/Representative Image Abu Dhabi will extend Darb road toll operating hours by an additional two hours daily from September 1, 2025, as part of updates aimed at easing city traffic congestion and encouraging public transport use. The new rules also scrap the daily and monthly fee caps, marking major changes for regular commuters across the capital.TL;DR:Darb toll hours are extended: Evening charges apply from 3pm to 7pm, Monday to Saturday (previously 5pm to 7pm).Dh4 toll applies per pass at all four main bridges during morning (7am–9am) and new extended afternoon hours.Daily and monthly toll caps are removed; charges are now unlimited. Exemptions remain for eligible groups, and tolls do not apply on Sundays or public holidays.New toll timings and locationsFrom September 1, 2025, motorists in Abu Dhabi will pay Dh4 for each trip through Darb toll gates between 3pm and 7pm (Monday to Saturday), in addition to the unchanged morning window of 7am to 9am. Tolls are not charged outside these peak periods, nor on Sundays and public holidays. Abu Dhabi’s four main toll gates are at Sheikh Khalifa Bridge, Sheikh Zayed Bridge, Al Maqta Bridge, and Musaffah Bridge, key entrance points to the city. These changes are managed by Q Mobility, under the Department of Municipalities and Transport.A major update is the removal of daily and monthly fee limits, meaning motorists will pay the Dh4 charge each time they use a toll gate during charging hours. Previously, charges could not exceed Dh16 per day, while monthly caps depended on how many vehicles a user owned. With caps abolished, high-frequency users should budget accordingly.Exemptions and policy rationaleExemption policies remain unchanged for people with disabilities, low-income families, senior citizens, and retirees. The extension and cap removal are intended to improve peak hour traffic flow, reduce congestion, and prompt more commuters to consider public transit, especially given the city’s ongoing population boom. Abu Dhabi’s population now exceeds 4.1 million, up 51% in a decade; surging vehicle registrations and rapid development underscore the importance of adaptive traffic management strategies in the emirate.With extended toll hours and the removal of daily and monthly payment limits, Abu Dhabi is signaling a shift toward tighter congestion control and stronger incentives for public transport. Motorists are urged to adjust their travel habits and budgets as these new rules take effect.FAQ1. When does Abu Dhabi’s extended Darb toll timing start?The new toll hours begin on September 1, 2025, extending evening charges from 3pm to 7pm.2. What is the current toll charge per trip through Darb gates?The fee remains Dh4 per passage during peak hours in the morning and newly extended afternoon period.3. Are there daily or monthly caps on toll payments?No, daily and monthly toll caps have been removed; all tolls must now be paid per trip without limits.4. Which toll gates are affected by the new timings?Toll gates on Sheikh Khalifa Bridge, Sheikh Zayed Bridge, Al Maqta Bridge, and Musaffah Bridge all apply the new schedule.5. Who is exempt from paying the Darb toll?People with disabilities, low-income families, seniors, and retirees remain exempt from the toll fees.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

According to the Ministry of Transport, Communications, and Information Technology, a total of 2,427,195 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) were handled during this period. This marks an 11.7% increase compared to the 2,173,508 TEUs managed in the same timeframe of 2024.In tandem, the overall volume of goods handled by Omani ports also grew. Ports collectively processed 70,114,527 tonnes of cargo from January to June 2025, compared to 66,620,847 tonnes in the corresponding period last year — a 5.2% increase. The rise highlights both the enhanced logistics capacity and the growing demand across Oman’s key port hubs.Higher ship arrivals at key portsShip traffic to and through Oman also saw notable growth. During the first half of 2025, 6,586 ships arrived at Omani ports and marine docks outside port facilities. This reflects an 11.1% growth compared to the 5,930 vessels recorded in the same period of 2024.Several key ports were primary contributors to this upward trend. Among them:Sultan Qaboos PortShinas PortPort of SalalahThese ports played a central role in absorbing the increased maritime activity and accommodating the expanded flow of vessels into the country.Growth in vehicle and livestock importsBeyond containers and cargo, Omani ports also saw an uptick in other import categories. In the first half of 2025:50,248 vehicles were received through the ports.2,694,293 heads of livestock were imported.These figures underscore the ports' importance not just for trade and industry, but also for meeting diverse economic and commercial needs ranging from the automotive sector to food supply chains.Strategic port infrastructure initiatives underwayTo sustain and support this growth, the Ministry of Transport, Communications, and Information Technology has advanced several infrastructure projects aimed at enhancing port capabilities and maritime readiness.Key developments include:Awarding of consultancy services for the design and supervision of development works at Khor Jarama, which will bolster maritime utility and preparedness at the site.Tender awards for the rehabilitation of Shannah Port and Masirah Port, intended to modernise and upgrade these facilities for improved service delivery and operational resilience.These efforts reflect the Ministry’s ongoing commitment to ensuring Oman's ports remain competitive, efficient, and equipped for future demand.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

'India like shining Mercedes': Pakistan interior minister echoes Asim Munir's crude analogy - what he said
Pakistan's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi has escalated tensions with India by repeating a controversial analogy made by Army Chief Asim Munir, comparing India to a “shining Mercedes” and Pakistan to a “dump truck.” This statement, initially made during a Saudi delegation visit aimed at de-escalating border tensions, has drawn criticism.

Pakistan's interior minister, Mohsin Naqvi, has stirred tensions with India by echoing a controversial remark made by Army Chief Asim Munir, comparing India to a “shining Mercedes” and Pakistan to a “dump truck.”Naqvi on Sunday quoted Munir as telling the Saudi delegation, “India is like a shining Mercedes, but we are like a dumper truck, loaded with stones; imagine what happens when the two collide.”According to Naqvi, the Army Chief made the statement during the Saudi delegation’s visit to Pakistan, aimed at de-escalating border tensions between the two neighbouring countries, News International reported. He also claimed that none of the missiles fired by India struck Pakistani targets, despite clear evidence.PollDo you agree with Pakistan's Interior Minister's comparison of India and Pakistan?Yes, it highlights the reality.No, it's an inappropriate analogy. India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7-2024 in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, targeting nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and neutralising over 100 terrorists. Tensions flared as both countries exchanged cross-border fire for four days. Indian Air Force Chief Air Chief Marshal AP Singh later confirmed that the Indian Air Force (IAF) shot down six Pakistani aircraft during Operation Sindoor, including five fighter jets and a high-value surveillance platform. He shared satellite imagery and intelligence inputs detailing the extent of damage inflicted on Pakistan’s air fleet and terror infrastructure. Earlier this month, Asim Munir issued a brazen threat to India, stating that Islamabad would take down “half the world" with it if his country faces an existential threat from India in the future. India dismissed his remarks as another example of Islamabad’s “nuclear sabre-rattling" and asserted that New Delhi would not tolerate nuclear blackmail. The central talking point of Munir’s threat was his “crude analogy,” where he described India as a “shining Mercedes” and Pakistan as a “dump truck full of gravel.” “I am going to use a crude analogy to explain the situation," Munir said. “India is shining Mercedes coming on a highway like Ferrari, but we are a dump truck full of gravel. If the truck hits the car, who is going to be the loser?" His remarks were viciously trolled on social media, with users highlighting Munir’s accidental admission of Pakistan’s poor standing compared to India. “Pakistan’s military might is a myth held together by duct tape and delusions," a netizen wrote. Russia fired a ballistic missile at Kharkiv, killing nine in Ukraine as President Zelensky landed in the US.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The imagery and messages emphasized her dedication to service and her understated style. Credit: John Swannell for Buckingham Palace/PA Wire Princess Anne turned 75 on August 15. To mark the day, the Prince and Princess of Wales posted a short birthday wish and shared her newly released portrait of the Princess Royal. Their message read, “Wishing Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal a very Happy 75th Birthday!” The image is part of a set released for the milestone. Shot at Gatcombe Park by John Swannell, the portrait keeps the tone formal and restrained—very Anne. Swannell has photographed her across multiple milestone birthdays, a continuity that suits the Princess Royal’s preference for understatement.Image Credit: John Swannell for Buckingham Palace/PA WireThere was also an earlier portrait released the week before: a two-shot of Anne with Sir Tim Laurence, taken at Windsor Castle by Chris Jackson ahead of July’s French state banquet. That image drew attention to a sleeker, pulled-back hairstyle, a look Anne also wore at the banquet with her longtime Festoon Tiara. Photo by Chris Jackson/Getty Images for Buckingham PalaceThe post from William and Kate landed during the family’s summer break, but the message stayed classic: a clear portrait, a brief line, and no long caption. It matches Anne’s public style and allows the picture to do the talking. Prince William & Kate Middleton's ‘Forever Home’ Dream Leaves Neighbours HomelessAs ever, the focus around her birthday was service. Anne is widely cited as one of the monarchy’s hardest-working royals, and official birthday coverage emphasized her decades of engagements and patronages. Family figured in the week’s imagery, too. The Windsor channels highlighted Anne and Sir Tim’s quiet partnership, as well as archival moments from her life—reminders of a career defined by duty, sport and charity more than spectacle. Why does a single post matter? It shows how the Wales household and the Princess Royal present milestones now: warm but minimal, with the visuals carrying the sentiment. For Anne, the emphasis stays on the work rather than the social-media flourish. As the summer break continues, the family is expected to spend time together in Scotland, with no indication of a large public event for the occasion. For the Princess Royal, a steady calendar and a modest celebration remain the norm—and the Waleses’ short message matched that mood. The takeaway: a milestone birthday, a clean portrait, and a brief wish from nephew and niece-in-law—small gestures that say plenty about how Princess Anne works, and how the royal family marks personal events today.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Both the city and Holmgren later retracted the claim, with the mayor telling KSL TV’s Alex Cabrero that he could not confirm any details as the scene was still active.The shooting sparked a huge police response, with support from neighbouring law enforcement agencies. As per Newsweek, the suspect was eventually taken into custody and moved to Box Elder County Jail. Authorities confirmed there is no ongoing threat to the public, although residents were asked to stay away from the area. A temporary “shelter in place” order had been issued earlier in the night. Officials also said no civilians were hurt.A local resident, Randy Kidman, described his frightening experience when a stray bullet struck his car. “I thought there was somebody lighting off fireworks,” he was quoted as saying by Fox 13 Now. “I come up the road, and I saw two cop cars and something in the road, and decided it wasn’t a good situation. I went to go back out, and when I went to back out, I caught a bullet through the driver’s side door and it went out my windshield… It’s pretty freaky.”Reported scanner audio from Box Elder County is going viral on social media, which captured the tense exchanges between officers during the incident, including calls for SWAT support and reports of two officers down at the intersection near the school. However, the authenticity of the audio can’t be verified.The name of the suspect has not yet been released.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

European leaders will join the meeting to shape peace talk frameworks. Ukraine fears ‘repetition of a contentious’ encounter in Oval Office (Picture credit: AP) Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will meet US President Donald Trump in Washington on Monday, with European leaders also joining the talks. As per the Washington Post, the meeting comes amid warnings that it could mirror the “disastrous” Oval Office clash earlier this year that saw relations between Kyiv and Washington plunge.During his last visit to the White House in February, Zelenskyy’s discussions with Trump and Vice President JD Vance ended abruptly after a bitter row. Trump accused him of showing disrespect and of “gambling with World War III.” The joint press conference was cancelled, Zelenskyy was ushered out, and US military aid was briefly frozen. US media described the encounter as “disastrous” and a major diplomatic blow for Ukraine.As per the Washington Post, “Foremost in Ukrainians’ minds is avoiding a repetition of a contentious meeting in the Oval Office”.Nikolay Beleskov, a research fellow at the Ukrainian National Institute for Strategic Studies, was quoted as saying by the Washington Post that there was “such risk indeed” of another tense exchange.He said Zelenskyy must “strike a balance between being non-provocative” while still advancing his demands in Washington.The stakes are particularly high as Trump has just held his first in-person talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin since the Ukraine war escalated in 2022. The Anchorage summit on Friday was labelled “warm” by Trump and “frank” and “substantive” by Putin, according to RT.Following the meeting, Trump suggested that Washington and Moscow were “pretty close to the end” of the conflict and is reportedly considering a plan that would require Kyiv to surrender remaining parts of Donbass in return for a Russian halt in fighting elsewhere, as per RT. Zelenskyy, however, has repeatedly ruled out making territorial concessions.Moscow continues to demand neutrality, demilitarisation and “denazification” of Ukraine, along with recognition of the territories it annexed, Crimea, Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporozhye. Putin had also said the Alaska talks brought the US and Russia “closer” to ending hostilities.The February clash between Trump and Zelenskyy also saw Vance publicly accuse the Ukrainian leader of being “disrespectful” and ungrateful for billions in American aid. The meeting ended without the signing of a minerals agreement that had been central to Zelenskyy’s trip, and Washington temporarily cut off military and intelligence assistance afterwards.Since then, both sides have attempted to repair relations. Trump and Zelenskyy held follow-up meetings in the Vatican in April and at the Nato summit in June, where a minerals deal was eventually signed. Now, with Trump signalling he may provide security guarantees to Ukraine, European leaders, among them UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte and EU chief Ursula von der Leyen, will attend Monday’s discussions to shape the framework for peace talks.As per CNN, JD Vance, a key figure in February’s confrontation, will also be present during the Oval Office meeting.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Kuwait to replace all foreign judges with citizens by 2030 in sweeping workforce nationalization
Kuwait aims to fully nationalize its judiciary by 2030, replacing foreign judges and staff with qualified Kuwaiti professionals. This initiative is part of broader reforms to empower local talent and modernize the legal sector.

This initiative is part of broader reforms to empower local talent and modernize the legal sector. Similar national workforce integration efforts are underway in vital sectors like oil and technical fields, with stricter recruitment rules for expatriates. Justice Ministry commits to full Kuwaitization of judicial staff by 2030/Image: File Kuwait’s Minister of Justice, Counsellor Nasser Al-Sumait, has confirmed that the country’s judiciary will be fully “Kuwaitized” by 2030, meaning all judicial positions, currently sometimes held by foreign workers will be occupied by qualified Kuwaiti nationals. This initiative forms a core pillar of sweeping reforms to strengthen local talent, empower national professionals, and modernize the legal sector.TL;DR:Kuwait’s judiciary aims to be staffed entirely by citizens by 2030 as part of “Kuwaitization.”The transition is underway across judicial departments, with Legislative reforms also in motion to boost independence and efficiency.Private and public sectors, especially oil and technical fields, are undergoing similar national workforce integration, including strict recruitment and job protection rules.Details of the judicial Kuwaitization driveMinister Al-Sumait states that procedures are already advancing within all judicial departments to replace expatriate judges and staff with skilled Kuwaiti professionals as per a report by People Matters. “The matter has been decided, and we are committed to achieving 100% Kuwaitization by 2030,” he declared, underlining the determination behind the plan. The Ministry of Justice is coordinating closely to ensure that all appointments and promotions prioritize quality, training, and readiness among Kuwaiti candidates.Coupled with the ambitious staffing goal, the Judicial Independence Law is under legislative review intended to secure the judiciary’s autonomy, improve administrative frameworks, and align national structures with contemporary legal best practices. The approach emphasizes not just nationalization, but also efficiency, capability, and global alignment.Kuwaitization across sectorsThe Judiciary initiative follows notable progress in other vital sectors. Kuwait’s oil industry, already Kuwaitized in key engineering and technical roles serves as a model. Local workforce integration in oil is supported by the Manpower Contractors Kuwaitization Initiative (begun in 2002), offering fair wages, benefits, and stable employment for nationals. As of 2024, the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) and subsidiaries have reportedly reached 100% national staffing in top positions, with ongoing efforts to remove barriers for Kuwaitis, ensure job continuity, and phase out reliance on foreign staff.Tightened recruitment for technical & professional rolesThe Public Authority for Manpower has also introduced new, stricter requirements for expatriates seeking technical posts, such as medicine, engineering, law, education, accounting, and finance. All candidates must now pass an online professional proficiency test and undergo thorough academic and work experience verification, typically three to five years via official bodies and Kuwaiti embassies abroad. For existing foreign workers and those switching sectors, changes in job titles or academic records are tightly regulated to ensure only appropriately qualified staff remain.Any roles involving security screening require explicit clearance from the Authority before obtaining Ministry of Interior approval, reinforcing comprehensive compliance and oversight.Kuwait’s sweeping Kuwaitization campaign in the judiciary and beyond seeks to empower Kuwaiti nationals, modernize the labour landscape, and drive sustainable long-term development. Legislative changes, stricter recruitment, and a focus on homegrown talent reflect a national strategy for competitive, capable, and independent institutions across the board.FAQ1. What does Kuwaitization mean in the judiciary context?It means that by 2030, all judicial positions currently held by expatriates will be replaced by qualified Kuwaiti nationals.2. Is the judiciary Kuwaitization process already underway?Yes, the Ministry of Justice is actively implementing the transition across judicial departments.3. What are some legislative reforms accompanying the Kuwaitization plan?The Judicial Independence Law is under review to strengthen the judiciary’s autonomy, efficiency, and alignment with modern legal frameworks.4. Are Kuwaitization efforts limited to the judiciary?No, Kuwaitization is also advancing strongly in sectors like oil, engineering, medicine, and finance, with stricter recruitment and qualification rules for expatriates.5. What new requirements must expatriates meet for technical jobs in Kuwait?Candidates must pass online proficiency tests and undergo rigorous verification of academic credentials and work experience through official authorities.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

This shift comes after criticism of his informal attire during a previous visit to the White House.  In high-stakes meeting between US President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart in Washington, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is likely to show up in more formal attire. According to a designer who earlier collaborated with Zelenskyy told Fox News that he most likely "will not appear in a polo." Ukrainian designer Elvira Gasanova said, "I think he will choose a black military suit or a military-style shirt with trousers — perhaps a jacket."After getting humiliated at the White House earlier for his informal attire, Gasanova said that this time he is likely to choose "a more serious look — though less symbolic.""After the recent ‘no suit’ drama, he will likely approach this question differently," she told Fox News. Earlier in February, the world witnessed a drama after a reporter questioned Zelenskyy over his informal outfit in White House. "Why don't you wear a suit? You're at the highest level in this country's office, and you refuse to wear a suit," one reporter asked. "… Do you own a suit?"Gasanova, who is the founder of Ukrainian fashion brands GASANOVA and DAMIRLI, revealed that Zelenskyy doesn't have a personal stylist, unlike other world leaders.

Using advanced biometric and AI technology, the system automates identity verification in real time, enhancing speed, security, and capacity. This marks a major step toward seamless, document-free travel and next-gen airport experiences. ChatGPT said:Dubai's AI-powered immigration corridor at DXB processes ten passengers at once, enabling seamless, document-free entry using biometric verification/Representative Image  Dubai International Airport has launched a cutting-edge, AI-powered corridor that allows travellers to bypass traditional passport control in seconds. Unveiled by the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA), the new system can process multiple passengers simultaneously—marking a global first in airport immigration technology and advancing Dubai’s vision for seamless, document-free travel.A global first: AI corridor redefines airport clearanceDubai has introduced the world’s first artificial intelligence-powered immigration corridor at Dubai International Airport (DXB), which has retained its title as the busiest international airport for the 11th consecutive year. The initiative was officially announced by Lieutenant General Mohammed Ahmed Al Marri, Director General of the GDRFA.This innovation enables passengers to walk across a special passage—referred to internally as the “red carpet”—to complete immigration formalities without stopping or presenting travel documents. Up to ten passengers can pass through at the same time, a significant improvement over the traditional one-passenger-at-a-time model.The AI corridor is a major step within Dubai’s broader “travel without borders” strategy. It is designed as part of a larger integrated system aimed at providing faster, smoother, and more secure transit for travellers.How the AI corridor works: Speed meets securityThe AI corridor processes passenger information automatically and in real time. Using advanced artificial intelligence, the system identifies and verifies travellers before they reach the immigration checkpoint, allowing them to walk through without presenting ID or stopping for inspection.Despite the speed and simplicity, security is not compromised. The system includes built-in mechanisms that flag any suspicious passports and immediately route them to forgery experts for review. This ensures robust screening while reducing manual workload and queue times.As a result, overall processing capacity has doubled, helping reduce congestion and improving efficiency during high-traffic periods.Enhancing Dubai’s global standingLieutenant General Al Marri highlighted that DXB is not merely a transit point but a prominent international gateway that reflects the UAE’s progressive identity and hospitality. The launch of the AI-powered corridor reinforces Dubai’s standing as a hub of technological innovation and operational excellence.He further stated that the GDRFA’s work aligns with a long-term innovation roadmap that focuses on leveraging technology to modernise and streamline border control procedures. The shift toward automated, document-free travel is expected to become a defining feature of global air travel, with Dubai leading that transformation.Key Features and Operational ImpactSimultaneous ProcessingThe corridor allows up to 10 passengers to pass through at once, significantly accelerating throughput.No Document Requirement Travellers do not need to present passports or ID, as the system uses AI-based identity recognition.Pre-Arrival Data Recognition Passenger data is matched and verified before arrival at the checkpoint, enabling real-time clearance.Automated Security Protocols If irregularities are detected, suspicious documents are automatically flagged and sent to specialist forgery teams.Scalable Infrastructure By increasing efficiency, the corridor is built to support higher passenger volumes during peak times without adding congestion.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
