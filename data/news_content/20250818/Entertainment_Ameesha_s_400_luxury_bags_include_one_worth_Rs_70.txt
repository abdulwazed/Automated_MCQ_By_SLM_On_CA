Filmmaker Farah Khan toured her collection, admiring its rarity and value, while Ameesha joked about her expensive hobby costing her a Mumbai penthouse. Before making her debut in ‘Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai’, Ameesha Patel was already known as a true South Bombay girl, a fact reflected in her impressive handbag collection. Coming from a family with strong roots in business and politics, she began amassing designer bags at just 12 years old. Today, her collection boasts nearly 400 bags, each valued in lakhs of rupees. Recently, filmmaker and choreographer Farah Khan toured Ameesha’s home and shared a sneak peek of this stunning assortment.Farah Khan is amazed by Ameesha’s extensive collectionAt the start of the vlog, Farah expressed her amazement, saying, “I have never seen Ameesha repeat her bag. She must have the maximum number of designer bags in the industry.” Ameesha then shared that her collection includes around 300 to 400 luxury bags, in addition to several clutches and belt bags. Alongside handbags, she is also passionate about collecting luxury watches.Ameesha Patel Returns: Casual Look, Classic Charm In JuhuBirkin bags are stored in an organized cupboardFarah indicated a cupboard and remarked, “This cupboard is filled with Ameesha’s Birkin bags.” Considered one of the most prestigious brands globally, a Birkin bag can be priced as high as Rs 2-3 crore.Detailed inventory keeps track of her collectionInside the cupboard, the actor has neatly placed a detailed list that organizes the bags by each shelf. One section of the list reads: “Shelf 7: Hermes Yellow Evelyn, Hermes Baby Pink Evelyn, Hermes Fuschia Pink Evelyn, Hermes Orange Evelyn, Hermes Powder Blue Evelyn, Hermes Mini Red Evelyn, Hermes Mini White Evelyn, Dior Denim Saddle Bag, Fendi Phone Case, LV Phone Case.”Saint Laurent bag captivates Farah KhanThe actress carefully took out a Saint Laurent bag from its protective cover to show Farah. Seeing it, the filmmaker was visibly impressed and sighed, “This is a bag I have wanted for so long ever and ever but it is…” before making a facial expression that hinted it was beyond her budget.Rare Bottega Veneta bags steal the spotlightNext, they chose a bag from Bottega Veneta. As Farah unwrapped it, she told the viewers, “This is one of the most expensive brands in the world: Bottega Veneta.” She revealed an orange bag, commenting, “This is a rare one I am seeing.” Ameesha chimed in, “This is a little traditional colour.” Farah agreed, “Yeah, exactly why I have never even seen it.” Then Ameesha showcased another bag from the same brand and style in black, saying, “This is a little classic, this is Black.” With a smile, Ameesha joked, “If I didn’t have a habit of collecting bags, I would have been owning a penthouse in Mumbai,” referring to the high value of her collection.Playful banter about marriage and bagsNext, she revealed another bag from Bottega Veneta. Farah couldn’t help but joke, “I think you should marry Karan Johar.” Ameesha responded, “I think so too. We want to be single so it is an ideal relationship.” As Ameesha displayed her Andiamo Large Tote, Farah admired it as “gorgeous” and teased, “Don’t show this to Dilip, he will simply use it to buy vegetables.” Ameesha then laughed, explaining how people often poke fun at her for carrying such big bags. “They say, ‘These bags are bigger and heavier than you, so you use them for veggies only,’” she shared. Farah agreed, “This is very heavy.” Ameesha added, “Yeah, and it gets heavier when I add stuff in it.” The price tag on this bag is upwards of ₹5,80,000."Get the latest updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
