This shift aims to define a new era for Indian cricket. LONDON, ENGLAND - AUGUST 04: India coach Gautam Gambhir with Mohammed Siraj of India after the end of the match on day five of the 5th Rothesay Test Match at The Kia Oval on August 04, 2025 in London, England. (Photo by Gareth Copley/Getty Images) Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has thrown his weight behind head coach Gautam Gambhir, praising him for prioritising “team culture” over “star culture” in Indian cricket. Speaking candidly, Pathan highlighted how long-standing favoritism towards established names had often hurt promising players, and suggested that Gambhir, alongside chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar, is determined to bring lasting change in Indian cricket.“Mere liye team culture bahut important hai. (For me, team culture is very important). Gautam Gambhir jo hai na wahaan pe, jab tak wo apni coaching journey khatam karenge na, wo team culture le ke aayenge puri tarah se. (As long as Gambhir is the coach, he will fully instill team culture),” Pathan told Lallantop.Gautam Gambhir's fiery press conferences: Every time the India head coach lost his coolGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!The former left-arm pacer also spoke on how Indian cricket has, at times, been reluctant to move on from struggling players due to their past reputation. “Humare yahaan ek banda fail hue ja raha hai 3, 4, 5 saal se magar usko chance de do kyunki wo bahut bada player hai. Kahi toh aapko full stop lagana padega na. (Here, a player keeps failing for 3, 4, 5 years, but still gets opportunities because he is a big name. Somewhere, you have to put a full stop),” he explained.Pathan praised the current selection panel, led by Agarkar, for their balanced approach in picking teams. “Dusra jinka naam nahi aata, wo banda abada jabardast hai Indian cricket ke liye — chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar. (The other person who deserves credit is Ajit Agarkar, he is fantastic for Indian cricket),” Pathan said.PollDo you agree with Irfan Pathan's view that team culture is more important than star culture in cricket?Strongly AgreeAgreeDisagreeStrongly DisagreeHighlighting the decision-making process, Pathan stressed the importance of alignment between coach and selectors. “Aaj ek koi bhi decision hota hai na, wo sirf coach nahi le sakta, ek koi bhi decision selector nahi le sakta. Do log agar mil jaaye, jo majboot ho wo fir sahi direction mey jaate hai. Mujhe lagta hai ye dono sahi direction me ja rahe hai... team culture ko le kar. (Today, no decision can be taken solely by the coach or solely by the selector. If two strong individuals come together, the team moves in the right direction. I believe Gambhir and Agarkar are doing that with team culture),” he added.Pathan’s words reflect growing support for Gambhir’s philosophy of reducing individual favoritism and ensuring merit-based opportunities — a shift that could define the next era of Indian cricket.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
