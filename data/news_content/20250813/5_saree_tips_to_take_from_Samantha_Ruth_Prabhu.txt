Whether she’s walking the red carpet, attending a temple visit, or promoting her latest film, Samantha has this uncanny ability to make a six-yard drape feel fresh, current, and endlessly stylish. Her Instagram alone is practically a mood board for anyone who wants to give their saree game a serious upgrade.Here’s how to take a few lessons from Samantha’s playbook and turn the humble saree into your ultimate style weapon.by TOI Lifestyle Desk 2/7​Master the art of mixing texturesOne thing Samantha does better than most is pairing contrasting textures in a way that feels intentional and luxe. You will often spot her wearing a crisp organza saree with a raw silk blouse, or a matte cotton drape with a metallic brocade blouse.The trick? The fabrics should talk to each other, not compete. If the saree has a soft, flowy drape, she’ll go for a blouse with more structure. If the saree is rich and heavy, she’ll balance it with a simpler, lighter blouse.For us mere mortals, this means stepping outside the matching-set mindset. That Kanjeevaram in your cupboard? Try pairing it with a velvet blouse for winter weddings. Got a breezy linen saree? Give it some shine with a sequin or mirror-work blouse.3/7Play with unconventional blouse stylesIf there’s one thing Samantha has taught us, it’s that the blouse can make (or break) your saree look. She isn’t afraid of experimenting, from strappy corset-style cholis to high-neck blouses with dramatic sleeves.The magic is in balancing the mood of the event with the blouse design. For traditional festivities, she leans towards elbow-length sleeves and heritage necklines. For fashion-forward occasions, she isn’t shy about trying halter necks, off-shoulder cuts, or even capes as a blouse alternative.The lesson? Think beyond the regular tailor-cut blouse. Raid Pinterest for ideas, mix in some contemporary silhouettes, and let the blouse set the tone for your entire look.4/7​Keep your jewellery intentionalSamantha’s saree looks are never weighed down with jewellery just for the sake of it. If she’s wearing a heavy, embellished saree, she’ll often let it breathe with just statement earrings. On the flip side, with simpler drapes like a plain tussar or organza, she’ll turn up the drama with chunky temple jewellery or layered necklaces.It’s about intention, not excess. Every piece she wears feels like it belongs, creating harmony instead of visual chaos.If you are styling your own saree, take a beat before reaching for the whole jewellery box. Ask yourself: is the saree the hero or the accessories? Then edit accordingly. Sometimes, less sparkle equals more impact.5/7​Nail the drape for the occasionFrom a crisp corporate pallu for a business event to a loose, casual drape for a day wedding, Samantha always tailors her saree pleats to the moment. She even experiments with belt-cinched sarees for a modern twist, a trick that works wonders for creating shape and adding a little edge.The biggest takeaway here is to treat your saree drape like styling hair or makeup: adapt it to the vibe. A tight, structured drape works for formal occasions, while a relaxed, low-pleat version feels more laid-back and bohemian.Pro tip: if you’re wearing the saree all day, make sure the pleats are pinned securely (a mishap mid-event is never chic). Samantha’s looks always appear effortless because they’re also practical, no tugging or adjusting every five minutes.6/7Let the saree reflect your moodPerhaps Samantha’s most important saree lesson is that she doesn’t wear it like a costume, she wears it like an extension of herself. Some days it’s a blush-pink floral drape that screams romantic and whimsical. Other days, it’s a strong, deep-coloured silk that says, “I mean business.”Fashion is personal, and the saree is one of the most adaptable garments in the world. Feeling playful? Go for bright colours, quirky prints, or ruffled edges. In a minimalist mood? Choose muted tones with subtle detailing.The point is: the saree isn’t just for weddings, pujas, or “special” days. Samantha wears hers to red carpets, movie promotions, and even casual brunches, proving that this centuries-old garment is as everyday-friendly as jeans if you style it right.7/7Magic of Samantha's sareesSamantha Ruth Prabhu’s saree style is the perfect blend of tradition and experimentation. She respects the garment’s heritage but refuses to treat it as untouchable. Instead, she makes it personal, modern, and infinitely wearable.So the next time you’re staring at your saree collection wondering how to make it feel fresh, remember: mix textures, play with blouse styles, be intentional with jewellery, drape for the occasion, and above all, let the saree reflect you.The magic of Samantha’s saree looks isn’t in the price tags or designer labels, it’s in the way she wears them with confidence and joy. And that, more than any styling trick, is the ultimate tip worth stealing.Follow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousSet up a mini lotus pond at home with these easy tipsindiaJanmashtami 2025: How to make Makhana Paag at home forChhappan BhogFoodAttractive looks of Srithika SaneeshindiaSheet masks out, Kareena Kapoor Khan’s DIY napkin mask inindia10 creatures that can walk on waterindia​Bhagyashri Borse charms with her gorgeous outfits​indiaThese Zodiac Signs Play the Victim When They’re Actually in Controlindia10 things to know before getting a pet rabbitindiaThe Great Indian saf​ari: 9 wildlife trips beyond tigers and leopardstravel Next123 Photostories  Cooku With Comali 6: From Shabana Shajahan to Lakshmy Ramakrishnan – Meet the top 6 cooks of the season​'Coolie': Five big reasons to experience Rajinikanth and Lokesh Kanagaraj’s film on the big screenAnanya Panday moments that show her unstoppable rise to stardomDesi face masks which promise a glowing skin7 brain-boosting foods every child should eat and quick recipesFrom reunion with Asit Kumar Modi to unseen pictures: Times when Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah’s Disha Vakani aka Dayaben made headlinesFrom Gokarna to Varkala — 8 beautiful coastal towns of India that are a must-visit in this lifetime8.5 quintals of adulterated mawa seized in Hisar: 5 ways to do mawa purity test at homeThis is what happens when you drink fennel tea on an empty stomach123lifestyle videos13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement16:34Life After 60: Why India's seniors are choosing community living04:34Control Your Senses, Gain Knowledge, Attain Peace: Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4.3906:37Cultural Clashes in Love: How To Make Your Relationship Work03:19Prayagraj MahaKumbh 2025 Readies For Millions: Massive Preparations Underway In Uttar Pradesh04:48Sadhguru Reveals The Truth About Black Magic And Your Photograph07:18BK Shivani On Forgiveness: Why It’s Essential For Inner Peace08:08How Bhairavi Sadhana Accelerates Your Path to Liberation: Sadhguru Speaks06:47Breakup Recovery: How To Not Wallow In Misery And Love Yourself03:20The Purifying Power of Yajna: Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4, Verse 3011:41How Dattatreya Accepted Parashuram as His Disciple – Sadhguru Reveals03:54Can Water Remember?
