The blaze, which started on Tuesday afternoon, is still threatening several villages in the aude department, where 1,500 firefighters have been battling to extinguish it."The fire is advancing in an area where all the conditions are ripe for it to progress. We are monitoring the edges and the back of the fire to prevent flare-ups," said Lucie Roesch, secretary general of the qude prefecture.She said firefighters are expecting to receive aerial support at dawn, but warned "this fire will keep us busy for several days. It's a long-term operation".The fire's advance slowed overnight due to high humidity levels, she added.One person was seriously burned and another injured, the prefecture said, adding that seven firefighters were also hurt. Camping grounds and one village were partially evacuated, and several local roads have been closed."All of the Nation's resources are mobilised," French president Emmanuel Macron said on X, while calling on people to exercise "the utmost caution".The qude department has seen an increase in areas burnt in recent years, aggravated by low rainfall and the removal of vineyards, which used to help break the progression of fires.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous10 beautiful and low-maintenance fishes for home aquariumsLifestyleKelley Mack: A look into the actress's most popular worksEntertainmentMalvi Malhotra redefines chic in THESE picsEntertainmentVitamins in broccoli: A, C, K, and more in one powerful veggieLifestyleJenna Ortega’s Wednesday promo looks redefine gothic glamourEntertainmentMegha Chakraborty’s Bubbly Fashion GametvKajal Raghwani blends tradition with charm in every graceful ethnic momentEntertainmentReduce dementia risk: 10 lifestyle changes that can protect your brainLifestyleUnmissable entry looks of Bigg Boss Malayalam 7 contestantstvPeshwai nath to Nathuli: Trendy hoop naths that deserve a place in your vanity boxLifestyle Next123 Photostories  The secret of Lingaraj: A temple where two gods dwell as oneBeyond Gangtok: 5 hill stations in Sikkim that redefine peace and serenity5 Foods that can work like natural laxatives and fix constipationUntold stories from Jaya Prada’s life and legacy7 smart ways for couples to split financesExploring wild side of Goa: 5 wildlife sanctuaries that are a treat to the senses6 Surprising Animals That Don’t Have Bones in Their BodiesThe best exercises to get rid of cellulite5 saree colours Rekha wears on repeat!What happens when you eat 2 apples a day and 5 simple breakfast recipes to try123Hot PicksRBI MPC MeetPatna Double Decker BridgeSpiceJetRBI MPC MeetRussia OilUS China TradeNSDL IPO allotmentTop TrendingTrinity RodmanDe'Aaron FoxConnor BedardDennis RodmanRussell WilsonMitch MarnersKirby DachMatthew TkachukConnor McDavidAdam RuzickaTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteBird slams into plane nose: Cabin filled with smoke mid-air; panic on Paris-bound flight — watchBaby bonus: China offers subsidy to boost birth rate; why 'lie flat' gen isn't convinced‘Remains hopeful’: Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs’ lawyer seeks Trump’s pardon; Combs to remain jailed till sentencing'I am going to exert my powers': Prosecute minors as adults?
