JAIPUR: Congress general secretary Sachin Pilot on Wednesday alleged that the BJP was defending the Election Commission instead of allowing it to respond independently to serious concerns regarding irregularities in the voter lists. Speaking to reporters here, the former deputy chief minister of Rajasthan said that rather than answering the issues raised by the Congress and Rahul Gandhi, the BJP had stepped forward to shield the poll authority.Union Minister Anurag Thakur Turns Tables On Opposition In 'Vote Chori' War With ‘Fake Voter’ Data "The government should not interfere. The Election Commission has a constitutional and moral responsibility to ensure that every vote is genuine and no manipulation takes place," he said. Pilot accused the BJP of targeting opposition leaders while avoiding an investigation into alleged voter fraud. "Instead of probing the matter, the government is demanding an affidavit from Rahul Gandhi. Notices are being issued and over 200 MPs were detained. Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge were taken into custody. This is not how a democracy functions," he said. He said that in several constituencies, thousands of votes had either been deleted or manipulated deliberately. "Fake votes, fake addresses and deletion of genuine names -- all point to a deliberate attempt to disenfranchise voters. Tampering with the voter list is a serious crime," he said. Pilot claimed that a former chief justice of India, who was a member of election-related panel, was removed without explanation. He alleged that the silence of the EC after Rahul Gandhi exposed the "voter fraud" raised further suspicion. "Why is the EC not responding? Why is the BJP speaking on EC's behalf? The poll body is the soul of democracy and its transparency and independence must be protected," Pilot said. The Congress leader said that the party did not make baseless accusations but it presented documented evidence of irregularities. "We have simply demanded an impartial investigation. If the Commission remains silent, it raises serious questions," he said. Pilot said the Congress would continue its campaign on the issue.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousWhen looks can be deceptive: 10 ‘PRETTY’ killers in the animal worldLifestyleSet up a mini lotus pond at home with these easy tipsLifestyleAttractive looks of Srithika Saneeshtv10 creatures that can walk on waterLifestyleSheet masks out, Kareena Kapoor Khan’s DIY napkin mask inLifestyleBhagyashri Borse charms with her gorgeous outfitsEntertainmentMost affordable diesel cars under Rs 12 lakh: Kia Syros, Mahindra Thar and moreautoThese Zodiac Signs Play the Victim When They’re Actually in Controlastrology10 things to know before getting a pet rabbitLifestyleDiarrhea: What to eat and avoid when the stomach is upsetLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Jamashtami: This panjiri recipe is made with a kitchen spiceHer longevity secret? 87-year-old Sheila Isaacs reveals her one true love for staying healthy5 saree tips to take from South Indian 'saree queen' Samantha Ruth PrabhuLabrador Retriever vs Beagle: Which is a better pet dog for families with children?'Coolie': Five big reasons to experience Rajinikanth and Lokesh Kanagaraj’s film on the big screenCooku With Comali 6: From Shabana Shajahan to Lakshmy Ramakrishnan – Meet the top 6 cooks of the seasonAnanya Panday moments that show her unstoppable rise to stardom7 brain-boosting foods every child should eat and quick recipes8.5 quintals of adulterated mawa seized in Hisar: 5 ways to do mawa purity test at homeFrom reunion with Asit Kumar Modi to unseen pictures: Times when Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah’s Disha Vakani aka Dayaben made headlines123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillJessica RadcliffeLebron JamesBasanti ChatterjeePatrick MahomesGautam AdaniElon MuskIndia Nayara EnergyCJI GavaiBengaluru Student AttackTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire Website'History must not be permitted to repeat': Rahul Gandhi says 'may face harm' in Savarkar defamation case; cites complainant's Godse lineageCongress rallies behind Priyanka Gandhi: Party leaders slam Israeli envoy’s ‘undiplomatic’ attack; call remarks an affront to democracy'Anti-Tamil Nadu activities': Congress to boycott governor RN Ravi's Independence Day tea party; to skip event for 2nd straight yearEvening news wrap: SC says 11-ID list in Bihar SIR 'inclusive'; Jaishankar to meet Lavrov in Moscow & more‘Evidence of crime’: Congress challenges BJP over Sonia Gandhi voter ID claim; flags PM Modi’s ‘thin victory’ in VaranasiConvocation row: Scholar snubs Tamil Nadu governor; Annamalai hits out at DMK for 'low-grade politics'Dadar Kabutarkhana row: BMC says planning controlled feeding of pigeons; Bombay HC says public must be heard firstSachin Pilot alleges BJP shielding EC over 'voter fraud'Bihar: EC sends notice to BJP's Muzaffarpur mayor; hours after Tejashwi said she has 2 voter ID cardsAI saves elephants: 6,592 safe elephant crossings on Tamil Nadu railway tracks; no fatalities in nine monthsA hoax: Truth behind Jessica Radcliffe orca attack incident; here’s what you need to know7 Indian-origin global CEOs and how their education shaped their success'I am shocked': As Parliament passes tax bill without debate, Sitharaman hits out at opposition for not participating in discussion - watchRG Kar case row: TMC’s Kunal Ghosh sends legal notice to victim’s father over ‘settled’ case claim; demands apology or proofApple iPhone 15 available for Rs 32,780 on Amazon; know how to grab the dealTrump tariffs: India ‘recalcitrant’ in trade talks, says US treasury chiefGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status; convictions of 2 years or more will lead to cancellationWhy neighbours are 'concerned' with Mark Zuckerberg buying houses in Palo Alto, the place that has been house to Steve Jobs and other tech execsManipur NEET UG 2025 merit list out for MBBS, BDS, BASLP, BPT courses: Check direct link hereJanmashtami 2025: Is Krishna Janmashtami on August 15 or 16?
