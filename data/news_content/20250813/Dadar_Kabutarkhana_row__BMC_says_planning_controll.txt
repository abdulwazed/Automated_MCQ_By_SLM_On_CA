The judges made it clear that the closure decision had been taken in the interest of public health and “the sanctity of the same has to be maintained.”BMC counsel Ram Apte informed the court that the civic body intended to permit feeding for two hours each morning, from 6 am to 8 am, under certain conditions. The bench questioned whether the civic body had invited objections before taking such a step. "You (BMC) cannot just allow feeding now once you have already taken a closure decision keeping public health in mind. You will have to take a well considered decision," it said as quoted by PTI.The court directed that any application for controlled feeding must be followed by a public notice, giving citizens the opportunity to raise objections before a final decision is made.Meanwhile, the Maharashtra government submitted a list of 11 proposed members for a committee to conduct a scientific study on the impact of public pigeon feeding on human health. Advocate General Birendra Saraf said the panel, to be notified by August 20, will include officials from the public health and town planning departments as well as medical experts.The row over the Dadar Kabutarkhana escalated last week when the BMC covered the site with tarpaulin sheets to stop grain offerings, triggering protests in which the covers were forcibly removed. Following the protests, some individuals approached the BMC seeking interim arrangements for controlled feeding.Last month, the High Court had refused interim relief to the petitioners but ordered that no heritage kabutarkhanas be demolished. It also said the BMC could take action as per law against those feeding pigeons in public places.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
