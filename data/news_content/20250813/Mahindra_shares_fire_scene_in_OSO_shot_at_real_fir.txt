Almost 17 years after Om Shanti Om lit up the big screen, a fascinating behind-the-scenes detail about its iconic fire sequence has come to light. Anand Mahindra recently revealed that the dramatic scene — where Shah Rukh Khan’s Om risks his life to save Deepika Padukone’s Shantipriya — was filmed at Mumbai’s Mukesh Mills, a location with its own fiery past and eerie reputation.Connection between film and locationAt the event, Mahindra revealed that the location held a special connection to Om Shanti Om. He noted that Shah Rukh Khan chose to film the fire sequence at Mukesh Mills, possibly inspired by its own history — the site had once been destroyed in a fire, mirroring the film’s storyline of flames and reincarnation.SRK Praises Deepika's Motherhood RoleHe also pointed out that Shah Rukh had ridden a luxury bike in his 1994 hit Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa, adding that the actor has a fondness for the brand — making the motorcycle’s launch at Mukesh Mills all the more fitting.PollHow do you feel about using real fire instead of VFX in film scenes?It's thrilling and adds realismIt's too dangerous and riskyNo VFX, only real flamesIn an earlier interview with Hindi Rush, action director Sham Kaushal revealed that no VFX was used for the scene at the time — the fire was real. The set housed SRK, Deepika, three cameramen, and about 60 crew members from his team, making it nearly 100 people inside a burning set.An extremely stressful shootHe further shared that the shoot was extremely stressful, as the fire had to be extinguished within seconds of being lit to avoid any mishap. A single mistake could have led to disaster. Kaushal admitted there were moments when he stepped aside to cry on set, feeling so overwhelmed that he feared he might suffer a heart attack.Om Shanti Om, directed by Farah Khan, released in 2007 and marked Deepika Padukone’s acting debut. Alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika, the film also starred Shreyas Talpade, Arjun Rampal, and Kirron Kher in key roles.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
