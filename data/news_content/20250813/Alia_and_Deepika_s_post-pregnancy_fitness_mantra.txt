The 55-year-old, who works with A-listers like Alia Bhatt and Deepika Padukone, revealed how the artists stay fit despite their busy schedules.Yasmin Karachiwala opened up about pilates and high-functional trainingIn a podcast interview with Bhavishya Sindwani, Karachiwala claimed that while the workout routine is different for all the celebrities, the common things that tie them together are their commitment and discipline. “They know how working out is very important for their mental and physical health, and I think they keep that as a priority and ensure they get their workout done each day,” she said, before adding, “Going to a party or lunch with friends doesn't eat into their workout time.”Alia Bhatt’s Ex‑PA Arrested Over ₹77 Lakh Fraud: Full BreakdownRevealing that Alia and Deepika did pilates after their pregnancies, the instructor claimed that one cannot have a body like another, but can wish to be as fit as someone else. Furthermore, she added that what sets them apart is that the celebrities, including Katrina Kaif, listen to their bodies and respect the nutrition along with the exercise, following the charts she curated for them. The three leading actresses usually include pilates and high-functional training for their workout.About the 'zero-calorie noodles' Recently, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, a renowned chef introduced a recipe of zero-calorie noodles, which has been a favourite of Alia and Deepika. Harsh Dixit introduced The Miracle Noodles, made from tare (the seasoning base), often soy or miso, the broth, the noodles, protein, and toppings. The chef also recalled turning up a notch for the spice level for the ‘Piku’ actress as she demanded ‘ultra hot and extra spicy.’ With the proper exercising techniques, the actresses also take a hard look at the calories they intake and the food they consume.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
