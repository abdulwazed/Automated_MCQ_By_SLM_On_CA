The bill overhauls teacher training and certification, aiming to raise salaries and mandate full certification for core subject teachers by 2027-28. It also limits the hiring of uncertified teachers and supports residency programs to improve teacher preparation and retention, especially in rural districts.  Texas has faced a growing teacher crisis over the past decade. Loosened certification requirements and alternative pathways led to more than half of new public school teachers being uncertified, with nearly 1 in 5 lacking a college degree. Research reported by The 74 shows these trends have contributed to weaker student outcomes and high teacher turnover. Students with new, uncertified teachers lose around four months of reading and three months of math learning each year, compounding pandemic-related learning losses.In June, Governor Greg Abbott signed House Bill 2, a historic $8.5 billion education package aimed at overhauling teacher training, certification, and retention across the state.Key measures in House Bill 2Teacher Preparation Funding: Nearly $190 million allocated for teacher preparation and certification programs.Teacher Pay Raises: Around $4 billion dedicated to raising salaries for teachers and staff, with extra incentives for core subject teachers, long-serving educators, and staff in smaller districts.Certification Mandate: Core subject teachers must be fully certified by the 2027-28 school year, with an optional extension to 2029-30. Current teachers pursuing certification can earn a $1,000 bonus.Residency and Training Programs: Districts receive up to $39,500 per teacher resident and $21,500 per student teacher. Funding also supports high-quality program content, including mandatory reading and math academies.Addressing the teacher pipelineHouse Bill 2 limits parts of the 2015 Districts of Innovation policy, which previously allowed most Texas districts to hire uncertified teachers. By the 2023-24 school year, 56% of all new Texas teachers were uncertified, and almost three-quarters had no prior experience in Texas public schools, according to The 74. This lack of preparation contributed to high turnover, with 64% of uncertified teachers leaving the classroom within five years compared to about a third of traditionally certified teachers.Preparing teachers for the classroomResidency programs, such as the one at The University of Texas El Paso, provide year-long, immersive training that pairs teacher candidates with mentor teachers in challenging classrooms. Residents gradually take on teaching responsibilities, gaining hands-on experience before their first full year in the classroom. Prior to House Bill 2, financial support for residents was limited, making it difficult to maintain the program. The new legislation ensures stipends for residents, making high-quality training more accessible, especially for students from low-income backgrounds.Wider impactsBeyond teacher training, House Bill 2 expands career and technical education, reforms special education, and increases funding for charter schools. Merit-based and retention-based pay programs aim to keep experienced teachers in the classroom, particularly in rural districts, where uncertified teacher hiring had been four times higher than the state average, according to The 74.With these sweeping measures, Texas is taking a historic step toward addressing teacher shortages, improving student outcomes, and creating a sustainable teacher pipeline for the future.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.
