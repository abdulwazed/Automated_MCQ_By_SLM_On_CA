NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Wednesday slammed the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) for ordering the closure of meat shops and slaughterhouses on August 15, for Independence Day.Sharing a post on X, Owaisi said the directive was “callous and unconstitutional,” questioning its link to Independence Day celebrations. Asaduddin Owaisi Fires 'BrahMos' Missile Warning At Pakistan After Shehbaz Sharif's Water Threat“Many municipal corporations across India seemed to have ordered that slaughterhouses and meat shops should be closed on 15th August. Unfortunately, @GHMCOnline has also made a similar order. This is callous and unconstitutional,” Owaisi posted on X.He argued that “99% of Telangana’s people” consume meat and such bans infringe on “people’s right to liberty and religion.”“What’s the connection between eating meat and celebrating independence day? 99% of Telangana’s people eat meat. These meat bans violate people’s right to liberty, privacy, livelihood, culture, nutrition & religion,” he added.The meat ban orders have sparked a political row, with leaders across party lines condemning them as an attack on personal food choices.Owaisi noted that several municipal bodies across India had issued similar orders.The Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar Municipal Corporation in Maharashtra has banned slaughter and meat sales on August 15, coinciding with Gokul Ashtami, and on August 20 for the Jain festival of Paryushan Parva, warning of strict action against violators.The Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) in Thane district has also directed meat shops to remain shut on Independence Day.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
