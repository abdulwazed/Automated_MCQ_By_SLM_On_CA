His family struggled with poverty after becoming political refugees. Chan's father even considered selling him for $250. Friends intervened, preventing the sale. Chan started as a child actor and stuntman. His breakthrough came with 'The Snake in the Eagle's Shadow'. He then revolutionized action cinema.  Action legend Jackie Chan may be one of the most recognisable movie stars in the world today, but his journey to fortune and global fame began in extreme hardship. The 'Rush Hour' actor, whose net worth is now estimated at over $557 million, was once going to be sold by his parents to help them overcome poverty.The actor once made the shocking revelation that his dad considered selling him to a British doctor for just $250, as "we was so poor."In a rather candid chat on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, the superstar recalled his parents’ struggles dealing with poverty and as political refugees from the Chinese Civil War. Revealing the reason for his father's decision to 'sell him', he shared, “my parents could not afford to pay the money, my father wanted to sell me to the British doctor for 250 dollars.”However, it was all because of a friend that his fate was changed. He shared, “As soon as my father wanted to sell me, somehow my friends [said], ‘No, no, no, this is your only child, you keep it.’ My father was lucky to keep me.”Chan's struggles continued well into his childhood. At age 5, he began working as a child actor in the Hong Kong film industry and earning a minimal income with small roles. He later became a stuntman at 17 before eventually transitioning into full-fledged action roles. He eventually got his big break in 1978 with The Snake in the Eagle's Shadow, after which, he went on to redefine action cinema with his unique blend of martial arts, comedy, and death-defying stunts.
