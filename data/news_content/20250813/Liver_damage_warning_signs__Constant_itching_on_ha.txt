Doctors say, this itching, especially on palms and soles, might be due to bile acid buildup. Liver disorders like cholestasis or cirrhosis are often linked. Watch for night-time itching, fatigue, or jaundice. Consult a doctor if symptoms persist. Simple steps can help soothe the itch.  Itchy hands and feet are commonly mistaken for dry skin, allergies, or minor irritations. However, when the itching is persistent, unexplained, and occurs without a visible rash, it could signal an underlying liver problem. Medical experts highlight that such itching, especially when concentrated on the palms and soles, may result from a buildup of bile acids in the bloodstream due to impaired liver function. This condition is often associated with disorders like cholestasis or liver cirrhosis. If the itching worsens at night, doesn’t respond to moisturisers, or is accompanied by fatigue or jaundice, it’s essential to consult a doctor promptly.Why liver damage can cause itching on hands and feetWhen the liver is not functioning properly, bile acids and toxins can build up in the bloodstream. These substances may then irritate nerve endings under the skin, leading to an intense, persistent itch, especially on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.This condition is known as cholestatic pruritus, and it often occurs without a visible rash, making it harder to diagnose. It is commonly linked to liver disorders such as:Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)CirrhosisIntrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP)Unknown Myths About Liver Disease BustedCauses of itching in liver disease:Scientists have not yet pinpointed a single cause behind the itching (pruritus) associated with liver disease. According to Healthline, it is believed to result from a combination of factors, which may include:1. Bile saltsIn liver disease, bile salts can accumulate beneath the skin, potentially triggering itching. However, this link isn’t consistent, some individuals with high bile salt levels don’t experience itching, while others itch despite normal levels.2. HistaminesMany people with liver-related itching have elevated histamine levels, although antihistamines are often ineffective in providing relief.3. SerotoninSerotonin may influence how the brain perceives itching, though its exact role remains unclear.4. Pregnancy and hormone therapyItching can worsen during pregnancy or while undergoing hormone replacement therapy, likely due to hormonal fluctuations.5. Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP)Elevated ALP levels are frequently seen in individuals experiencing itch-related liver conditions, suggesting a possible connection.Key symptoms to watch forIt’s important to differentiate everyday skin irritation from liver-related itching. Below are signs that your itching may be a warning from your liver:Itching without a rashMost skin conditions cause itching accompanied by redness, bumps, or inflammation.
