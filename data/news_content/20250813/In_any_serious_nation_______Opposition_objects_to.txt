NEW DELHI: The opposition on Wednesday raised objections over the appearance of three officers involved in Operation Sindoor on a TV show for Independence Day special.Taking to X, Kerala Congress said that inviting Sofiya Qureshi, Vyomika Singh and Prerna Deosthalee to a TV quiz show would be unthinkable in any serious nation with a professional military."Three officers of the Armed Forces will appear on Kaun Banega Crorepati, a private entertainment show, in full uniform, explaining to a Bollywood actor the planning of a military operation," the party said."In any serious nation with a professional military, this would be unthinkable. But this is the spectacle of New India under Narendra Modi," it added.Meanwhile, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi accused the TV network company of earning revenue from the upcoming India vs Pakistan cricket match in the Asia Cup, while also inviting the faces of Operation Sindoor to a quiz show."Our heroic women in uniform who went on to become the face of Operation Sindoor have been invited by a private entertainment channel on their show. This private entertainment channel’s parent company, Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI), has also bagged the broadcasting rights of the Asia Cup till 2031," Chaturvedi wrote on X."Yes, the very channel that seeks to earn revenue through India vs Pakistan cricket matches. Now join the dots," she added.A short teaser of the episode, which will be aired on August 15, was shared recently, showing the officers receiving a grand welcome from KBC host Amitabh Bachchan.In the promo, Colonel Qureshi was also seen explaining why Operation Sindoor, which India launched in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, was needed."Pakistan has been carrying out such (terror) acts repeatedly. A response was necessary, and that's why Operation Sindoor was planned," she said.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
