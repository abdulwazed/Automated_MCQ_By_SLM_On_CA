New study warns! Routine AI use may affect doctors’ tumor diagnostic skills by 20%
Artificial Intelligence is changing healthcare. It helps in early disease detection and treatment. A recent study shows doctors may lose skills if they depend too much on AI. When AI support was removed, doctors' tumor detection skills dropped. Experts suggest using AI as a support tool, not a replacement.

It helps in early disease detection and treatment. A recent study shows doctors may lose skills if they depend too much on AI. When AI support was removed, doctors' tumor detection skills dropped. Experts suggest using AI as a support tool, not a replacement. Regular training and critical thinking are important to maintain skills.   Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare, offering tools that improve early disease detection, diagnostic accuracy, and treatment planning. AI-assisted systems can help clinicians identify conditions such as pre-cancerous growths or subtle anomalies that might be missed otherwise, boosting patient outcomes and overall clinical efficiency. However, recent research highlights a potential downside: excessive reliance on AI may lead to skill erosion among healthcare professionals. Even experienced doctors who regularly use AI tools may find their independent decision-making and observational abilities decline over time. AI has the potential to transform medicine, improve patient outcomes, and streamline healthcare workflows. However, the recent study serves as a reminder that over-reliance on technology can erode critical skills, even among experienced doctors. A balanced approach—where AI supports rather than replaces human judgment—is essential for sustaining both high-quality patient care and professional expertise.Doctors’ ability to spot pre-cancerous growths declines when AI is removedA recent study in The Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology, investigated how AI impacts colonoscopy performance. The researchers found that AI assistance enabled doctors to detect pre-cancerous growths in the colon more effectively, potentially preventing progression to colorectal cancer.However, a concerning trend emerged: when AI support was removed, doctors’ ability to detect tumors dropped by approximately 20%, even compared with rates recorded before AI introduction. This suggests that clinicians may unconsciously rely on AI cues, reducing their independent observational skills.Global adoption of AI in healthcare systemsHealthcare systems worldwide are increasingly investing in AI technology. AI is being positioned as a tool to boost diagnostic accuracy, improve workflow efficiency, and enhance patient safety.For instance, in 2025, the British government announced £11 million (S$19 million) in funding for a trial exploring how AI can facilitate earlier breast cancer detection. While AI offers promising benefits, these developments highlight the importance of maintaining human expertise alongside technological advancements.Doctors losing skills due to AI dependence: Here’s what the study foundThe study revealed that AI can inadvertently encourage over-reliance, even among highly skilled clinicians. According to the research paper, AI support can result in doctors becoming less motivated, less focused, and less responsible when making decisions independently.The researchers studied four endoscopy centers in Poland, comparing colonoscopy detection rates three months before and after AI implementation. The procedures were randomized: some were performed with AI guidance, others without. The difference in detection rates highlighted the risk of skill erosion caused by dependency on AI tools.AI can reduce tumor detection skills in expert doctorsInterestingly, the study participants were 19 highly experienced doctors, each with over 2,000 colonoscopies completed. Despite their expertise, AI still affected their ability to detect tumors without assistance.Professor Yuichi Mori, one of the study authors from the University of Oslo, warned that skill degradation could worsen as AI becomes more sophisticated.Dr. Omer Ahmad, a gastroenterologist at University College Hospital London, added:“Although AI continues to offer great promise to enhance clinical outcomes, we must also safeguard against the quiet erosion of fundamental skills required for high-quality endoscopy.”He noted that the effect could be more pronounced for trainees or novice doctors, who might become overly dependent on AI before mastering essential diagnostic skills.Excessive AI use may reduce brain engagement and focus; study revealsConcerns about over-reliance on AI extend beyond healthcare. A 2025 MIT study found that students using OpenAI’s ChatGPT to write essays demonstrated less cognitive engagement and brain activity, illustrating how AI can unintentionally reduce critical thinking skills.These findings underscore the need for balanced AI integration—leveraging AI’s advantages while ensuring that human expertise and cognitive abilities remain intact.Strategies to maintain skills while using AITo mitigate skill erosion, healthcare professionals and institutions can adopt several strategies:AI as a support tool, not a replacement – Use AI to assist decisions while maintaining independent judgment.Regular performance monitoring – Track detection accuracy with and without AI to identify skill gaps.Structured training rotations – Alternate between AI-assisted and manual procedures to preserve proficiency.Active critical thinking – Encourage clinicians to question and evaluate AI suggestions rather than blindly following them.Continuous education – Reinforce fundamental diagnostic skills through workshops and refresher courses.By implementing these measures, healthcare systems can maximise AI’s benefits while safeguarding essential clinical competencies.Disclaimer: The information presented in this article is for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.
