The protests intensified, with students marching and burning an effigy of the Vice Chancellor. The university cites infrastructure improvements as the reason.  Students at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) have been protesting for five days against a sharp increase in annual fees, which they say will block access to higher education for many, especially those from economically weaker backgrounds. On Tuesday, the protest intensified with students marching to the district collectorate and burning an effigy of Vice Chancellor Naima Khatoon.Fee hike up to 42% sparks outrageThe recent fee hike ranges between 36 to 42 percent for some courses. For instance, the annual fee for the Bachelor of Library Science (B.Lib) course jumped from Rs 16,000 last year to over Rs 22,000 this year. The All India Jammu and Kashmir Students Association (AIJKSA) described the increase as “arbitrary, unjustified and exclusionary,” reported PTI.J&K students association appeals to Union Education MinisterNasir Khehami, AIJKSA’s national convenor, said, “The students have been courageously opposing what they see as an arbitrary, unjustified and exclusionary fee hike of up to 36-42 per cent imposed by the university administration,” as reported by PTI. He added, “For this session, the fee for some courses has increased by around 30-40 per cent. For example, the B.Lib course fee was Rs 16,000 last year and has been raised to over Rs 22,000.”University cites infrastructure improvements as reason for hikeAMU Proctor Wasim Ali confirmed the fee increase ranged from Rs 500 to Rs 1,500 across courses, explaining that the hike was mainly to improve infrastructure and was a collective decision by various committees, reported PTI. However, Khehami emphasised, “this explanation does not lessen the crushing burden on the students, many of whom come from socially backward classes, working-class families and economically weaker sections, and are already struggling to meet their daily expenses, including basic meals,” as reported by PTI.Besides the fee issue, students have been demanding the conduct of students’ union elections, which have not been held for eight years. They also seek the removal of certain senior university officials whom they accuse of mishandling the current crisis, reported PTI.Concerns over police crackdown on campusThe protests saw a police crackdown on Friday during collective prayers at the dharna site. Opposition MPs have expressed concern over the reported use of force, writing to the Vice Chancellor demanding explanations and accountability, according to PTI.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a national coalition of farmer bodies, has extended its support to the AMU students. The SKM plans to highlight student grievances alongside farmer issues at a ‘Virodh Diwas’ protest in Aligarh. The group has also called for an investigation into the police actions on campus, reported PTI.The ongoing protests at AMU highlight the challenges faced by students from underprivileged backgrounds in accessing affordable higher education. As fees rise sharply, many fear losing the opportunity to study at prestigious institutions like AMU.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.
