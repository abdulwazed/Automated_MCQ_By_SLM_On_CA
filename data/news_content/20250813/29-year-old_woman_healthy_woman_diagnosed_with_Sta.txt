While genes and environment do play a role in Cancer diagnosis, there are other hidden factors that can lead to Cancer, even if you are otherwise low risk. 29-year-old Monika Choudhary was textbook healthy, till Cancer brutally came as a jolt. In an IG post, the entrepreneur revealed how things changed, and she lost focus on her health at some point consumed by stress, that she believes eventually led to her Cancer diagnosis. (image is representational)Work pressure, deadlinesIn her post, Monika said, "I’ve always been a focused person, especially when it comes to my health. I used to eat healthy and take good care of my diet. I never liked fried or oily food. When I started working on my own website, I didn’t realise how demanding and all-consuming it would become. The long working hours, screen time, constant deadlines, and stress slowly started to take a toll on me — mentally and physically.Cancer is curable if detected early: Signs to pay attention toMy days became sedentary. I wasn’t moving much, I barely stepped outside, and I completely lost touch with my physical routine."Huge shiftShe added, "This was a huge shift from the lifestyle I had before — I used to be extremely active. Evening runs were a part of my everyday routine. They were my escape, my therapy. As I got more immersed in work, I kept pushing my health to the side. I told myself I’d get back to it “soon” — but that “soon” never came."PollWhich factor do you believe poses the greatest risk for developing cancer?Chronic stress and overworkingPoor sleep and lifestyle habitsBody started giving signsMonika added that soon her body started giving signs. She said, "Slowly, my body started giving signs — fatigue, uneasiness, discomfort — but I dismissed them, blaming it all on work pressure or a lack of sleep."The rude joltMonika's life turned around when she was diagnosed with cancer. In her own words, "Then came the diagnosis: Stage-4 colorectal cancer. A shocking moment that changed everything. Looking back now, I realise this wasn’t just about bad luck. It was a result of stress, burnout, and complete physical neglect over time. I learned, in the hardest way possible, that no ambition is worth compromising your health. Our body always keeps the score — and it eventually demands attention, one way or another."How poor lifestyle conditions lead to CancerEven though no single risk factor leads to cancer, but stress, overworking, and lack of sleep affect the immune system and increases inflammation, and impairs hormone regulation. Let's see how...StressChronic stress produces effects beyond anxiety and overwhelming feelings. Prolonged stress exposure, leads the body to produce cortisol and adrenaline (stress hormones). The immune system struggles to detect abnormal cells, while chronic inflammation occurs as a result. The release of stress hormones results in DNA destruction, alongside disruptions to essential proteins, which combat cancer cell development. Chronic stress acts as an environment for cancer cells to proliferate, while facilitating their spread throughout the body.OverworkingPeople who work excessively, along with insufficient rest periods face an elevated danger of cancer development. The connection between extensive work hours and unhealthy behaviors, leads to poor diet choices and diminished exercise levels, along with elevated smoking and drinking habits which are established cancer risk factors. Scientific research indicates that work-related stress, and long working hours possibly lead to higher breast, lung and colorectal cancer rates, though this can vary.Insufficient sleepThe body requires sleep to heal itself, and protect its immune system from damage. The production of melatonin hormone which helps control sleep patterns and fights cancer, becomes disrupted when people experience sleep problems. Research shows that inadequate sleep duration or poor sleep quality, increases the likelihood of developing several types of cancer. The lack of sleep causes damaged DNA alongside weakened immunity, increased inflammation and disrupted circadian rhythms, which all work together to help cancer cells develop.SourcesInterplay between stress and cancer—A focus on inflammation - PMCWork stress and the risk of cancer: A meta-analysisLack of Sleep Linked to Increased Risk of Cancer - Cancer Therapy AdvisorChronic Stress Promotes Cancer Development - PMCLong working hours and cancer risk: a multi-cohort study - PMCSleep quality and risk of cancer: findings from the English cohort - PMCDoes Sleep Affect Cancer Risk? | American Cancer SocietyCancer and Sleep - Sleep FoundationStress and Cancer - NCIThe Link Between Stressful Jobs & Cancer | Early DetectionDisclaimer: This article is informational only and not a substitute for medical adviceAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.
