(PTI Photo/Kamal Kishore) New Delhi: Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) are likely to part ways with mentor Zaheer Khan ahead of the next Indian Premier League (IPL) season in 2026, TimesofIndia.com has learnt. "LSG is set to part ways with Zaheer Khan and the new mentor will be given a bigger role to monitor RPSG Group's other franchises," a source tracking the development confirmed to TimesofIndia.com.It is also learnt that LSG's owner Sanjiv Goenka, who is currently in the UK for The Hundred, will announce a Director of Cricket, who will oversee the year-round development of LSG's other franchises -- Durban's Super Giants in the SA20 and Manchester Originals in The Hundred.IPL 2025: What went wrong for Lucknow Super Giants?Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Zaheer had stepped into the mentor role as a replacement for Gautam Gambhir who stepped down after IPL 2023. The former India seamer was also fulfilling the bowling coach duties since Morne Morkel's exit, who left his role to work alongside Gambhir and the India men's cricket team.Between 2018 and 2022, Zaheer was associated with the Mumbai Indians (MI) franchise, initially serving as Director of Cricket before taking on the job of head of global development.PollShould LSG part ways with Zaheer Khan as their mentor?Yes, it's time for a changeNo, he should stayA couple of weeks ago, LSG had roped in Bharat Arun as their new bowling coach. "Arun's role is also extensive as he will be given an extra responsibility for scouting and working on their young quicks for Durban's Super Giants and, from next year, with the Manchester Originals as well," the source said.Under Rishabh Pant's leadership, LSG had a largely forgettable IPL 2025 season with flashes of brilliance but consistency being a challenge. Work to arrest that problematic run has already begun with Bharat Arun first and Zaheer Khan now."It's an honour to join the Lucknow Super Giants, a franchise that reflects professionalism, ambition, and vision at every level," Arun said in a statement. "My conversations with Dr. Sanjiv Goenka and the management were incredibly energizing -- there is a clear intent to invest in young Indian talent and build a long-term legacy."What excites me most is the vision for long-term development. LSG has invested in a young, talented, and dynamic group of Indian fast bowlers -- Akash Deep, Avesh Khan, Mayank Yadav, Prince Yadav, Mohsin Khan, and Akash Singh -- and I see immense potential in each of them. My mission is to help shape them into a cohesive, fearless, and tactically sharp pace unit that can challenge the best batting line-ups in the world."Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
