He noted that the real issue lies in municipalities’ failure to effectively utilise the allocated funds, despite resources being available.In a post on X on Wednesday, Tharoor wrote, “We need to protect humans while being humane to dogs. But one point no one mentions is that the flaw in our system is not lack of resources, but the unwillingness or inability of municipalities to perform the task of rounding up and neutering stray dogs, even when funds have been provided. These funds are never actually spent where needed — in making the arrangements that the SC, in understandable exasperation, has now decreed.”He suggested an alternative approach, adding, “Perhaps the funds should instead be allotted to Animal Welfare groups and sincere NGOs with a track record of sheltering animals? They are more likely to implement the ABC programme than the municipalities are.”PollDo you agree with Shashi Tharoor's suggestion to allocate funds for stray dog management to animal welfare organizations?Yes, they are more effective.No, municipalities should handle it.Tharoor’s remarks came in response to a post by advocate Ashutosh Dubey, who criticised TMC MP Saket Gokhale for urging the apex court to stay its order. Dubey highlighted that the Supreme Court had exercised its constitutional powers under Articles 32 and 142 to balance public safety with administrative responsibility, rejecting the “arbitrary” label for the ruling. He cited years of municipal non-compliance with the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, and the ABC Rules.Tharoor described Dubey’s comments as a "thoughtful response" to a problem affecting citizens in every city.The Supreme Court’s order, issued on Monday, directs authorities to permanently relocate all stray dogs in Delhi-NCR to shelters, where the animals will receive food, medical care, and attention. The court described the surge in dog bite incidents as an “extremely grim” situation.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan instructed authorities to build shelters for around 5,000 dogs within six to eight weeks, with plans to expand in phases. The court warned that any obstruction in the relocation drive could invite contempt proceedings against individuals or organisations.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
