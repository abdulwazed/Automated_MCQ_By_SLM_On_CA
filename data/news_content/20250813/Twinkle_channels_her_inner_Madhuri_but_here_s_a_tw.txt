She attempted to recreate Madhuri Dixit's iconic 'Tamma Tamma' moves, but humorously admitted the result resembled Sanjay Dutt's style more. The post garnered funny reactions from her husband, Akshay Kumar, and other celebrities, with fans sharing their amusement and personal dance mishap stories.  Twinkle Khanna, fondly known as Mrs Funnybones, has once again showcased her signature wit and humour. Twinkle has never shied away from making fun of herself or her movies. She's often even admitted that she was not meant to be an actor but now being a writer comes so naturally to her. She has displayed her funny side again, this time with a dance video that has left the internet in splits. The actress-turned-author revealed she was trying to replicate a classic Madhuri Dixit move, but the end result, according to her, was something else entirely.In a recent Instagram post, the 51-year-old exuded her usual vibrant charm, dressed in a black full-sleeved top and loose-fitting denim pants. The actress can be seen dancing on the iconic 'Tamma Tamma' song which featured Madhuri Dixit and Sanjay Dutt. There's no denying that Madhuri is one of the best dancers in the industry. As she danced away happily to this popular number, she wrote in her caption, “Thought I was pulling off a Madhuri, but ended up looking like Sanjay Dutt." Her caption and moves made everyone laugh and how. She also added a cheeky footnote, during the pandemic, she had actually fractured her foot attempting the very same step. Wrapping up her post, she asked fans, “Whose dance style do you think you have and what’s the reality?”Her husband, Akshay Kumar, couldn’t resist chiming in, commenting, “Talent – questionable. Confidence – unshakable. Wife – priceless.” To which Twinkle playfully replied, "@akshaykumar hahahaha." Celebrities joined in on the fun too. Deepshikha Deshmukh wrote, “Wohooooo – the happy feeet,” Tahira Kashyap teased, “Killed it quite literally!” while Guneet Monga responded with laughing faces, hearts, and fire emojis.Fans flooded the comments with their own brand of humour. One remarked, “I love that confidence of counting to the beat 1 2 3 and then start. N most off all adore u for putting it on gram.” Another joked, “So proud of your ankles right now,” while someone else gushed, “Your brand of humour! A fan of it since your very first book and then all those writeups!” A delighted follower added, “This is peak Twinkle Khanna energy.”Some even shared personal anecdotes — one user wrote, “Twinkle dear I am 60 YO. I had also sprained my foot while attempting this step when this movie had come. Now I can’t stop laughing remembering about it,” and another quipped, “When someone says ‘Break a Leg’……. Delivered attempting a Madhuri step.”About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
