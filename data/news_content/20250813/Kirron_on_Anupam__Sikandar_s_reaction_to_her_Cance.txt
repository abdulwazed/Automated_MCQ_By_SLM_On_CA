She emphasized that the cancer treatment was more challenging than the illness itself, citing the severe side effects of the medications and expressing reliance on faith during the difficult period.  Actor and politician Kirron Kher was diagnosed with Cancer in 2020 and now that she has recovered from it, she had opened up on her journey in an interview. Kirron had spoken about how her family, husband Anupam Kher and son Sikander Kher had reacted to her illness. She also opened up on her diagnosis and how the actual treatment of Cancer is more dangerous and has more side-effects. Recalling how husband Anupam Kher was completely shaken as he got to know she has Cancer, Kirron said on News18’s She Shakti event where she appeared along with Sikandar. The actor said, "It was end of 2020, I was shooting for my movie Monkey Man in Indonesia at that time. I was there for 4 months, everything is in a bubble so you are disconnected from the rest of the world. Life plays it’s cards the way it does. What do you do at that point? I think she is very strong that way, we were always there and are there for her throughout. At the end of the day, life goes on and work goes on. There’s nothing much that you can do, right?"

She said, "I have never seen you being emotional about it ever. I wanted you to be a little bit but you were not." Responding to it, Sikandar joked, "Main toh bimaari ke liye darr raha tha, maa. How can it mess with you? It can’t mess with you. Galat jagah aagaye boss tum. Those conversations were between me and dad when I was in Bataam." He went on to explain his approach, saying, “The thing is, you have to be strong. You can’t be saying ‘Oh My God’ around the person, it is going to kill all the good energy around you. Nobody is feeling good about it. Unfortunately, the situation and what happened is one of the worst things that happen in the world.”Kirron acknowledged his steady demeanor, contrasting it with Anupam’s nervousness. “Anupam used to look thoda sa ghabraaya hua when he used to come into my hospital room, but Sikander was cool. Every human is scared at one point in life about anything happening to them. But when it happens, the only option you have is to accept it,” she said.Sharing more about her battle, Kirron revealed that the treatment was even more grueling than the illness itself. “You have to get the treatment done. Bimaari se zyada khatarnaak ilaaj hai iska. The medicines and their side effects. The first 6-8 months were very tough, then God was kind. You leave it to the Lord. The Lord fights for me, who are we? We are nobodies,” she expressed.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
