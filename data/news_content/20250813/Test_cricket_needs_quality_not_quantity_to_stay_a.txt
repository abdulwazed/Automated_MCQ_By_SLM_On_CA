India won the fifth and final Test vs England at The Oval (Getty Images)  Australia cricket chief Todd Greenberg on Wednesday said a reduced Test calendar could help smaller nations, as the five-day format thrived most “where it means something.” With 100 days to go until the home Ashes series against England begins in Perth, the Cricket Australia CEO stressed that quality, not quantity, was key to keeping red-ball cricket strong."We're trying to send countries bankrupt if we force them to try to play Test cricket," he told reporters.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.
