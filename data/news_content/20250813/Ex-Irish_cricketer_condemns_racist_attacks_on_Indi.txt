Higgins' strong stance. O'Brien emphasized the deep connection between Ireland and India, highlighting the invaluable contributions of the Indian community to Irish society. Indian community stages protests in Ireland over racist attack.  Former Ireland cricketer Kevin O'Brien has condemned the recent racist attacks against Indians in Ireland through a statement posted on social media platform X. His statement follows Irish President Michael D. Higgins' denunciation of these incidents, highlighting the significant contributions of the Indian community to Irish society.O'Brien expressed deep sadness over the increasing racist attacks targeting the Indian diaspora in Ireland, emphasising the special relationship between Ireland and India."These attacks do not represent who we are as a people. India and its people hold a very special place in my heart and in the hearts of all my fellow Irish teammates," O'Brien stated in his social media post.The former cricketer further acknowledged the hospitality received by Irish teams in India and extended support to the Indian community in Ireland. "The warmth and love we have received in India has always made us feel at home. I hope this message makes you feel the same and I want to reiterate to the Indian community that Ireland is your home too. Your contribution to Irish society is immense and we deeply value everything you do," he added.Irish President Michael D. Higgins had previously issued a strong statement condemning these attacks through his office."The recent despicable attacks on members of the Indian community stand in stark contradiction to the values that we as a people hold dear. That any person in Ireland, particularly any young person, should be drawn into such behaviour through manipulation or provocation is to be unequivocally condemned," the president's office statement read.President Higgins also recognised the extensive contributions of the Indian community across various sectors in Ireland."We are all mindful of the immense contribution this community has made, and continues to make, to so many aspects of Irish life, in medicine, nursing, the caring professions, in cultural life, in business and enterprise, to cite just some. Their presence, their work, their culture, have been a source of enrichment and generosity to our shared life," the president's statement continued.These condemnations from prominent Irish figures come at a time when there has been an increase in reported racist incidents targeting the Indian community in Ireland.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
