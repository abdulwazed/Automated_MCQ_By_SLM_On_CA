(Image: Instagram) The Regional Transport Office (RTO) in Lucknow issued a notice on Monday (August 11) to cricketer Akash Deep, directing him to cease using his newly purchased SUV on public roads due to incomplete registration formalities and missing mandatory high-security registration plate (HSRP) and third registration mark (TRM). The notice gives the cricketer 72 hours to comply with all vehicle documentation requirements and appear before authorities.The vehicle was purchased on August 7, with insurance obtained on August 8, and received a fancy registration number (UP32 QW 0041) on August 9. However, the RTO discovered that the temporary registration and registration certificate process remained incomplete on the Vahan portal.Akash Deep press conference: On replacing Jasprit Bumrah, message from Gautam Gambhir and moreThe authorities found that the vehicle lacked the mandatory HSRP and TRM installations, which violates sections 39 and 41(6) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and Rule 50 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989."The notice warns that driving the vehicle in its current state constitutes an offence under Section 192 of the MVA and empowers authorities to seize or detain the vehicle under Section 207."The RTO has instructed Akash Deep to appear either personally or through an authorised representative within the specified timeframe, bringing all necessary documentation including proof of registration, insurance, and tax payment records.The Chinhat-based automobile dealership that delivered the vehicle to Akash Deep without the required HSRP and TRM also received a show-cause notice from the RTO. "Legal action under Sections 192 and 207 of the Motor Vehicles Act will be initiated against the defaulting dealer."The incident prompted the RTO to issue comprehensive instructions to all dealers in the region. These directives emphasise that no vehicle, regardless of temporary or permanent registration status, can be delivered to customers without HSRP and TRM installations.The dealers must ensure compliance with Form 20, 21, and 22 requirements before vehicle delivery. Additionally, they are required to update all relevant records on the Vahan portal prior to releasing vehicles to customers.“Dream delivered. Keys received.
