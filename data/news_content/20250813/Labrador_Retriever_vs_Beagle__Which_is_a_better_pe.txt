Do you have children and are thinking which popular pet dog is better-- Labrador Retriever or Beagle? Well, Labrador Retrievers and Beagles are two of the most popular breeds across the world, and both are known for their friendliness and playfulness. However, they do have certain differences that can make one dog breed more suitable for your household than the other, depending on your needs. So, here we list some key differences between the two that will help you select the right pet dog for you:2/8TemperamentLabrador Retrievers are known for being gentle, fun-loving, and patient— which makes them perfect pets for families with kids of all ages. Beagles too are friendly and playful, but they have a stronger independent streak, which can make them a bit mischievous.3/8Size and space needsThis is one of the most striing differences between the two pet dog breeds. Labradors are large and they need more space to move freely; and so, they are more suitable for people with large homes and bungalows. Whereas, due to their small size Beagles are perfect pets for people living in apartments or smaller homes.4/8Energy levelsBoth Labradors and Beagles are active, when it comes to their energy levels. But Labs need more structured exercise and outdoor play to stay active and healthy. Whereas, Beagles have bursts of high energy but can be happy with regular short walks and play sessions too.5/8 Grooming and sheddingBoth Labs and Beagles shed moderately. However, Labradors may shed a bit more seasonally. On the contrary, due to their short coats,  Beagles are easier to groom and maintain. Both the dog breeds need regular brushing to keep their coats clean and healthy.6/8TrainabilityDue to their people pleasing nature, Labradors respond well to training and positive reinforcement. This makes them great pets even for first-time owners. Beagles, on the other hand, are intelligent but can also be stubborn. And so, a person needs to handle them with a lot of patience and consistent positive reinforcement.7/8Health issuesLabradors are known to be more prone to joint issues like hip dysplasia. Meanwhile Beagles are prone to ear infections due to their floppy ears. Both the dog breeds need regular vet care to ensure they stay healthy.8/8Compatibility with kids Labradors are known for their patience and tolerance, which makes them perfect for younger children. While Beagles are equally affectionate, they may be better with slightly older kids who can match their playful energy and need for independence too at times.Follow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: How to make Makhana Paag at home forChhappan BhogFoodAttractive looks of Srithika SaneeshindiaSheet masks out, Kareena Kapoor Khan’s DIY napkin mask inindia10 creatures that can walk on waterindia​Bhagyashri Borse charms with her gorgeous outfits​indiaThese Zodiac Signs Play the Victim When They’re Actually in Controlindia10 things to know before getting a pet rabbitindiaThe Great Indian saf​ari: 9 wildlife trips beyond tigers and leopardstravelDiarrhea: What to eat and avoid when the stomach is upsetindia Next123 Photostories  Cooku With Comali 6: From Shabana Shajahan to Lakshmy Ramakrishnan – Meet the top 6 cooks of the season​'Coolie': Five big reasons to experience Rajinikanth and Lokesh Kanagaraj’s film on the big screenAnanya Panday moments that show her unstoppable rise to stardomDesi face masks which promise a glowing skin7 brain-boosting foods every child should eat and quick recipesFrom reunion with Asit Kumar Modi to unseen pictures: Times when Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah’s Disha Vakani aka Dayaben made headlinesFrom Gokarna to Varkala — 8 beautiful coastal towns of India that are a must-visit in this lifetime8.5 quintals of adulterated mawa seized in Hisar: 5 ways to do mawa purity test at homeThis is what happens when you drink fennel tea on an empty stomach123lifestyle videos13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement16:34Life After 60: Why India's seniors are choosing community living04:34Control Your Senses, Gain Knowledge, Attain Peace: Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4.3906:37Cultural Clashes in Love: How To Make Your Relationship Work03:19Prayagraj MahaKumbh 2025 Readies For Millions: Massive Preparations Underway In Uttar Pradesh04:48Sadhguru Reveals The Truth About Black Magic And Your Photograph07:18BK Shivani On Forgiveness: Why It’s Essential For Inner Peace08:08How Bhairavi Sadhana Accelerates Your Path to Liberation: Sadhguru Speaks06:47Breakup Recovery: How To Not Wallow In Misery And Love Yourself03:20The Purifying Power of Yajna: Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4, Verse 3011:41How Dattatreya Accepted Parashuram as His Disciple – Sadhguru Reveals03:54Can Water Remember?
