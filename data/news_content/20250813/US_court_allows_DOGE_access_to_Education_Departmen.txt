The ruling, tied to a broader lawsuit, impacts access to student loan data for millions. While K-12 records weren’t accessed, the decision raises ongoing debates over data privacy, government efficiency, and oversight.  A recent ruling by a federal appeals court has significant implications for students across the United States. On August 12, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond, Virginia, overturned a preliminary injunction that had previously blocked the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, from accessing sensitive records at the U.S. Department of Education, as well as the Treasury Department and the Office of Personnel Management. The decision restores DOGE’s access to federal databases while the broader legal challenge continues.What is DOGE and why does it matter for students? DOGE was established under the Trump administration to improve efficiency across federal agencies. The office, closely associated with Elon Musk, who served as an informal adviser to former President Trump, has employees embedded in multiple agencies to review operations and data. Although Musk stepped down from his White House role in May 2025, DOGE continues its work.According to the EdWeek, the American Federation of Teachers, along with other unions and individuals, had challenged DOGE’s access, arguing that it violated the Privacy Act of 1974 and placed sensitive data at risk. Specifically, the lawsuit noted DOGE employees accessed the Student Loan Data System, which contains records of approximately 43 million Americans, including teachers. The suit did not allege that K-12 student records were accessed.The court’s reasoning In its 2-1 decision, the 4th Circuit cited procedural issues with the lawsuit and indicated that the plaintiffs would likely have difficulty proving a violation of the Privacy Act. According to the EdWeek, Judge Julius N. Richardson, a Trump appointee, wrote that DOGE employees are tasked with a broad duty to improve agency efficiency and would find it challenging to know what needs reform without reviewing the data. Judge Richardson further noted that “each plaintiff’s information is one row in various databases that are millions upon millions of rows long,” suggesting that the potential harm from granting access to a handful of government employees differs in kind from the risks posed by reporters, investigators, or paparazzi. The majority also referenced a U.S. Supreme Court order in June that allowed DOGE employees access to Social Security Administration files, which similarly faced privacy concerns. According to the EdWeek, Richardson stated, “This case and that one are exceedingly similar”.In dissent, Judge Robert B. King, a Clinton appointee, argued that the district court had provided a thorough analysis demonstrating the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their Privacy Act claim. He described DOGE’s access as “sudden, unfettered, unprecedented, and apparently unnecessary” and emphasised the sensitivity of the personal information involved. Implications for students For students, this ruling highlights the ongoing tension between government efficiency initiatives and the safeguarding of personal data. While K-12 records were not part of the lawsuit, the ruling still involves access to large federal education databases, which could include higher education loan records and other student-related information. It underscores the need for students and educators to remain aware of how personal data is accessed and managed at the federal level. The case is not yet fully resolved. The full 4th Circuit is expected to examine the broader implications of DOGE’s access in the Social Security Administration case in September, which may provide further clarity on the limits and oversight of such government data initiatives. As legal proceedings continue, students and education stakeholders may see changes in how government offices access and use sensitive educational and personal data, making this a topic worth monitoring closely.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.
