Pawan Khera also requested result data from the Varanasi constituency, questioning PM Modi's victory margin.  NEW DELHI: Congress on Wednesday asked the Bharatiya Janata Party to furnish the "evidence of crime" after it accused Sonia Gandhi of possessing voter ID card even before becoming a citizen of India.Congress leader Pawan Khera also sought result data of Varanasi constituency from where Prime Minister Narendra Modi won by "a very thin margin" in 2024 Lok Sabha elections."Anurag Thakur released some data today. He got it through the electronic voter list. So, this is evidence of crime. We demand that Anurag Thakur provide us with this evidence of crime within 24 hours. We will then ask further questions. He has raised the same questions which we have been raising," Khera said."But it took us 6 months and they got it within 2 days...PM won in Varanasi by a very small margin. They should provide us the data of that constituency as well so that further action can be taken," he added.PollDo you think Anurag Thakur's allegations against Sonia Gandhi are credible?Yes, they seem credibleNo, they are baselessThis comes hours after BJP leader Anurag Thakur, in a press conference, alleged that Sonia Gandhi's name appeared on the electoral rolls in 1980, three years before she became an Indian citizen in 1983.Responding to Rahul Gandhi’s ‘vote chori’ allegations , BJP MP and Thakur presented what he called “proof” of discrepancies in Congress-held constituencies and questioned why the party ignored them.Quoting in Hindi, Thakur said, “The dust was on your face, yet you kept cleaning the mirror,” suggesting that Congress was avoiding self-reflection."If we start from 1952, Congress and CPI together defeated Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar, a constitution maker and a saint-like leader, in the election. Congress laid the foundation of electoral corruption in the very first election of 1952," Thakur said."This family and party have had a tradition from the beginning that if you lose an election, you raise questions about the Election Commission, the voters, or the functioning of the Election Commission. Indira Gandhi had said, Voters are a bunch of fools. When Rajiv Gandhi lost the election, he blamed the ballot paper. Rahul Gandhi's father used to say, conduct elections with voting machines, and Rahul Gandhi says, conduct elections with ballot papers," he said.On August 7, Gandhi unveiled what he had been describing as an “atom bomb” of evidence against the Election Commission. Citing data from the Mahadevapura assembly segment, which falls under the Bengaluru Central parliamentary constituency in Congress-ruled Karnataka, he accused the poll body of “colluding” with the BJP.The Election Commission has firmly rejected the allegations and asked Gandhi to sign an affidavit to formalise his complaint. He has refused, saying he has already sworn an oath to the Constitution.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
