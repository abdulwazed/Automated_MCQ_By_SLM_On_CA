While she delivered numerous memorable roles, Sridevi considered 'Mr. India,' directed by Shekhar Kapur, as her finest work.  Bollywood has always been blessed with talents that left a lasting impression not just on the cinematic landscape but also on the hearts of the audience. And one such talented artist who charmed all with her unmatched screen presence, sheer beauty, and the ability to evolve with time and every genre was Sridevi. Unfortunately, Sridevi is no longer among us, but even today, her work, her words, and her perspective towards life and cinema continue to inspire. Sridevi called THIS movie her best filmOver her illustrious career, Sridevi worked not just in Bollywood, but also in Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada cinema. From ‘Chandni’ to ‘ChaalBaaz,’ ‘Lamhe’ to ‘English Vinglish,’ her every film created a different magical spell, which made everyone fall for her and her craft. For her fans, each of her movies is nothing short of a masterpiece, but for Sridevi, there was one film that was special, which she called her best work.Poonam Dhillon Calls Sridevi ‘Brilliant’, Slams ‘Dumb’ Tag As UnfairAnd that movie is none other than ‘Mr India.’ Speaking about the movie and the director, Shekhar Kapur, in an old interview with Colors Cineplex, Sridevi mentioned, "In every film for an artist, it is the director who plays the biggest role. We were spontaneous, but it was the director who helped. For instance, I have worked with Shekhar Kapur, and I really enjoyed my experience in Mr India. It was my best film, I can say. Because that's the first film that was different from a glamorous role. People started talking, of course, I think she can also act."In the same conversation, she vividly remembered the famous Charlie Chaplin scene, which was originally intended to be a small part of the film. However, after Sridevi got all dressed in her costume and started her performance, Shekhar Kapur was so taken aback by her talent. He turned it into a significant comedic moment, one that continues to delight audiences even many years later.Sridevi birthday special: The actress who will always remain our ‘Chandni’About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
