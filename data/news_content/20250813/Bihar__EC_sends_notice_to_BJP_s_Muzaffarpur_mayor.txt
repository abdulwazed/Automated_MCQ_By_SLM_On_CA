Therefore, in connection with the above matter, you are kindly requested to present your statement/clarification by 16.08.2025, 5:00 PM, without fail, so that further action may be taken," it further said.This comes hours after Tejashwi accused the poll body of hatching a conspiracy to manipulate Bihar’s voter list by issuing two Electors Photo Identity Card (EPIC) numbers to Bharatiya Janata Party leaders and workers."Before we had talked about Bihar's deputy chief minister Vijay Sinha. Now you call it a crime, mistake, or an expose, we had said it before too, but today I want to tell you that EC is helping the BJP, and cutting the votes of the Opposition. The people of BJP are being given not one, but two EPIC numbers for themselves, in one vidhan sabha only, " Tejaswi said."We are exposing one more thing. Muzzafapur's mayor, a BJP leader, named Nirmala Devi, she has two EPIC IDs in the same vidhan sabha. In that too, they are different. Not only this, but Nirmala Devi has two brother-in-laws, they also have two EPIC numbers," he added.Earlier, the Election Commission issued a notice to Bihar deputy chief minister Vijay Kumar Sinha for allegedly possessing two voter cards and being registered as an elector at two places.The Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) for Bankipur assembly constituency, in a letter to the deputy CM on Sunday, sought Sinha's response for having registered as "a voter in two different assembly constituencies and possessing two ID cards".The showdown between ECI and Tejashwi Yadav began when he first alleged that his name was absent from the new draft voter list issued on August 1, and later claimed his EPIC number had been altered.The Election Commission, however, rejected these assertions, saying a detailed verification showed his name listed at serial number 416 of polling station 204 in the Library Building of Bihar Animal Science University.The Election Commission claimed that the EPIC showed by Tejashwi Yadav to the media during press conference was "fake". The poll body has asked him to submit it to the office by August 16."It seems that the EPIC displayed by you during a press conference is fake. Making and using false government documents is a legal offence. You are requested to submit the seemingly false EPIC at our office by 5pm on 16th August," Patna election officer said in a letter to Yadav.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
