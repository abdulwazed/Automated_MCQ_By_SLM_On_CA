Rohit Sharma and George Clooney  NEW DELHI: Former India left-arm fast bowler RP Singh fondly recalled the celebrations following the 2007 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup win, saying the victory parade in Mumbai was beyond anything he had ever imagined.Singh, who took 12 wickets in seven matches as MS Dhoni’s India clinched the inaugural T20 World Cup in South Africa in September 2007, said: “We won the T20 World Cup in South Africa, celebrated there, and then landed in Dubai, where a few people congratulated us for lifting the trophy. When we finally landed in Mumbai, we thought we had achieved something special, but the celebration parade was beyond anything I had imagined.”Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

But he was playing according to the situation of the match. Rahul bhai whispered in my ear, ‘If they are saying so much to him, then how much would they have said to me?’” he recalled.On a lighter note, Singh, who represented India in 14 Tests, 58 ODIs, and 10 T20Is, revealed he has often been mistaken for other famous personalities, including Rohit Sharma. “I’ve been mistaken for Rohit Sharma on several occasions, not just once, but many times.
