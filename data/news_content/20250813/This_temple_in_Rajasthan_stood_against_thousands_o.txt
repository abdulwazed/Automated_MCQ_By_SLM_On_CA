These lyrics are the emotions of every member of a family whose sons and daughters are serving their nations, standing on borders and guarding their homelands with their lives. Parts of the song, from the blockbuster movie ‘Border’ were extensively shot near the 1971 Battle of Longewala ground, near Jaisalmer which is also home to the revered Tanot Mata Temple.Tanot Mata is not an ordinary temple. This Hindu temple in Jaisalmer district, Rajasthan, is located near the border with Pakistan. It is where the Longewala war happened during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 where India came out victorious.Live bombs from the war, the storyThe temple is unique in many senses as it houses live bombs from the war. During the Indo-Pak war in 1965, the temple was attacked by over 3,000 bombs. But as per local lore, these bombs some missed their target and some did not explode. Soon after, India's Border Security Force (BSF) took charge of the maintenance of the temple and nearby region.Later, in 1971, Tanot was again attacked during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 (Battle of Longewala). The border was attacked by tanks but they could not get in and went down in the sand. After winning the war, a Vijay Stambha or a Victory tower was built inside the temple. The bombs that did not explode were placed inside the temple. These heavy looking bombs are now put on display on shelves inside the temple covered by glass doors. The tanks are placed close to the temple near the border. There’s also a cute cafe called ‘Border’ cafe and a theater room where only ‘Border’ (the movie) plays.Soldiers praying groundThis is an important temple for soldiers who regularly pray here. They have immense faith in the deity and believe that the goddess protects them from any harm. It is quite an emotional scene looking at these strong soldiers breaking down in front of the goddess's statue to seek her blessings.Who was Tanot MataAs per history books, the temple was built by the Bhati Rajput King Tanu Rao in 828 AD. And since then, the temple became popular among people of Jaisalmer. As per the Charan records, the deity here is the incarnation of Hinglaj Mata and who later reincarnated as the Karni Mata.Legend has it that a man named Mamadji Charan has no kids. He decided to visit Hinglaj Mata on foot seven times to get a child. Then Hinglaj Mata asked him whether he wanted a son or a daughter, the man asked the goddess herself to take birth at his house in the form of their own kid. Soon after, the man was blessed with seven daughters and one son and one among them was Aavad Mata, also known as Tanot Mata.Victory Memorial and the war museumThere is a Victory Memorial and a war museum housing the unexploded Pakistani bombs and tanks. On 16th December every year, the victory of India is celebrated at the temple. Today, the temple along with the war memorial museum are a part of Bharat Ranbhoomi Darshan initiative of the Indian Military.
