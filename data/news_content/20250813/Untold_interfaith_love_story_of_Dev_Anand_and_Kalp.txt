Bollywood icon Dev Anand's life was marked by a discreet yet profound romance with Kalpana Karthik. Their secret wedding, a stark contrast to the industry's fanfare, occurred during a lunch break on the set of 'Taxi Driver'. Kalpana, born Mona Singha, left her promising film career after marriage to embrace family life, cherishing their private bond away from public scrutiny.  In Bollywood, where love stories often unfold under the harsh glare of the spotlight, some romances are quietly nurtured in the shadows. One such tale belongs to Dev Anand and Kalpana Karthik — a union that defied religious boundaries, bloomed away from prying eyes, and remained one of the industry’s most charmingly guarded secrets. Gurdaspur to the city of dreamsDev Anand, Bollywood’s original style icon, was celebrated for his suave charm, distinctive dialogue delivery, and a trademark hairstyle that fans tried to emulate. His signature look — a black coat paired with a crisp white shirt — became so famous (and distracting) that it was once reportedly banned in courtrooms.Hailing from Gurdaspur Dev Anand earned his English degree from Lahore in 1942. Though he dreamt of pursuing higher studies, financial hardships stood in the way. In 1945, with just ₹20 in his pocket, he set out for Mumbai to chase his cinematic dreams.PollWhich of Dev Anand's films do you think is the most iconic? GuideTaxi DriverA humble startWithout a place to call his own, he shared a cramped room near the railway station with three other dreamers chasing fame. As his savings ran out, he found work at the Military Censor Office, sifting through soldiers’ letters for a monthly pay of Rs 165.About a year later, he sought help from his elder brother, Chetan Anand, already an established name in cinema. Chetan offered him small roles, leading to the superstar's debut in 1946 with Hum Ek Hain. While the film failed at the box office, his next release, Ziddi (1948), catapulted him to overnight stardom. Over his illustrious career, he starred in 112 films, delivering timeless classics like Taxi Driver (1954), CID (1956), Paying Guest (1957), Nau Do Gyarah (1957), Kala Paani (1958), Asli-Naqli (1962), Guide (1965), Jewel Thief (1967), Johny Mera Naam (1970), Tere-Mere Sapne (1971), Hare Rama Hare Krishna (1971), and Heera Panna (1973).The Suraiya chapterIn those days, life moved at a gentler rhythm, and emotions carried deep weight. The actor was deeply in love with actress Suraiya, but their romance faced staunch opposition from her family over religious differences. Suraiya chose never to marry, holding on to her enduring affection for him.While shooting Taxi Driver, he developed a fondness for his co-star Mona Singh, who later adopted the screen name Kalpana Karthik. What began as friendship soon blossomed into a quiet, enduring romance.A secret weddingDuring one lunch break on the set, the duo slipped away unnoticed. When they returned, a keen-eyed cameraman spotted a fresh ring on Dev Anand’s finger. With a knowing smile, Dev quietly requested him to keep the secret.It was later revealed that the two had secretly tied the knot. Dev Anand believed marriage was an intimate affair, not something to be turned into a public spectacle.Who was Kalpana Karthik?Kalpana Karthik, born Mona Singha into a Christian-Punjabi family, adopted her screen name when Chetan Anand cast her in Baazi (1951). Before her film debut, she had participated in the Miss Shimla contest, where she first caught Chetan Anand’s attention—they were cousins by marriage.Kalpana's brief yet memorable film career featured roles in Andhiyan (1952), Humsafar (1953), Taxi Driver (1954), House No. 44 (1955), and Nau Do Gyarah (1957). Following her marriage to Dev Anand, she stepped away from the spotlight to focus on family life. The couple had two children, Sunil Anand and Debina.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
