India vs Pakistan (File Photo) NEW DELHI: India’s landmark National Sports Governance Bill, passed smoothly in Parliament, will be implemented within the next six months, with “drafting of rules and identification of infrastructure” already underway, Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya has said.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!“This bill will be implemented as soon as possible. Within the next six months, all procedures will be completed to ensure 100 per cent implementation,” Mandaviya told PTI in his first interview after the legislation cleared both Houses. Calling it “the single biggest reform in sports since independence”, he said the aim was to ensure the new National Sports Board (NSB) and National Sports Tribunal (NST) are “fully functional at the earliest possible date consistent with statutory and procedural requirements.”Explained: Why The India-Pakistan Asia Cup Clash Cannot Be Cancelled Despite BacklashA key provision of the bill gives the government discretionary power to “impose reasonable restrictions” on international participation of Indian teams and athletes under “extraordinary circumstances”.“The provision empowering the government to stop international participation is a standard safeguard seen in sports laws globally, intended for use in extraordinary circumstances,” Mandaviya said. “It covers situations such as national security threats, diplomatic boycotts, or global emergencies, and is not directed against any particular country.”He cited cricketing precedent to underline the policy’s real-world context: “...full senior men’s cricket tours to Pakistan have not taken place since the 2008 Mumbai attacks, and high-profile matches have often been moved to neutral venues. Such decisions are taken on a case-by-case basis in consultation with the Ministry of External Affairs and security agencies.”“This reflects the Modi government’s clarity in protecting national interest while upholding global sporting obligations,” he added.Mandaviya said the challenges in bringing the bill to life included over 350 ongoing sports-related court cases, balancing Olympic Charter autonomy with accountability, and the varied professionalism across federations. Consensus came after “more than 60 rounds of structured discussions” with state ministers, NSFs, athletes, and coaches.“I gave an entire day to NSF representatives, an entire day to athletes, coaches. I gave presentations to explain each and every clause of the bill. I explained to them why I think the clauses were needed. I did not impose, I asked for their feedback,” he said, adding that he even went through “each and every one of the 600 public suggestions.”Former sports minister Ajai Maken, who drafted an earlier version in 2011, was also consulted. “In 2013, honourable Ajay Maken ji brought this bill to the cabinet but it could not be passed... vested interests within NSFs... were against coming under any kind of governance scrutiny,” Mandaviya said.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
