She starred in his 2021 directorial debut Downfalls High and appeared alongside him and Pete Davidson in Big Time Adolescence back in 2019. So yes, they have history, but is it friendly or flirty? Both are now single. MGK officially split from Megan Fox in December 2024 and recently welcomed baby Saga (yes, that is the name) with her.

Allegedly, he once asked his mum if she had ever disappeared mysteriously, and she admitted to an abduction. Yup, that happened.Also, his dream musical collab? Frank Sinatra.
