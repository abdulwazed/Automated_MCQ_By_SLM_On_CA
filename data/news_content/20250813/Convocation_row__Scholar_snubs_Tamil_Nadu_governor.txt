There are more people in Tamil Nadu who dislike the DMK than those who support it. If they were to behave in the same manner, where would the Chief Minister hide his face?"PollWhat is your opinion on Jean Joseph's decision to bypass the governor during her degree acceptance? It was a brave decision. It was inappropriate.The incident took place during the 32nd convocation ceremony of the Manonmaniam Sundaranar University (MSU), where students were lined up to receive their degrees from Tamil Nadu governor RN Ravi. One student, Jean Joseph, chose to bypass the governor and instead accepted her degree from vice chancellor Chandrasekar, who was standing beside him.Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, Jean Joseph said: "Governor RN Ravi has been acting against the interests of Tamil Nadu and Tamils. I did not want to receive my degree from him," as quoted by news agency IANS.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
