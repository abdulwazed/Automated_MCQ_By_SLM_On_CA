Owaisi argues that the ban infringes upon citizens' rights to liberty, privacy, livelihood, culture, nutrition, and religion, questioning the connection between eating meat and celebrating independence.  NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Wednesday slammed the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) for ordering the closure of meat shops and slaughterhouses on August 15, for Independence Day.Sharing a post on X, Owaisi said the directive was “callous and unconstitutional,” questioning its link to Independence Day celebrations. Asaduddin Owaisi Fires 'BrahMos' Missile Warning At Pakistan After Shehbaz Sharif's Water Threat“Many municipal corporations across India seemed to have ordered that slaughterhouses and meat shops should be closed on 15th August. Unfortunately, @GHMCOnline has also made a similar order. This is callous and unconstitutional,” Owaisi posted on X.He argued that “99% of Telangana’s people” consume meat and such bans infringe on “people’s right to liberty and religion.”“What’s the connection between eating meat and celebrating independence day? 99% of Telangana’s people eat meat. These meat bans violate people’s right to liberty, privacy, livelihood, culture, nutrition & religion,” he added.The meat ban orders have sparked a political row, with leaders across party lines condemning them as an attack on personal food choices.Owaisi noted that several municipal bodies across India had issued similar orders.The Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar Municipal Corporation in Maharashtra has banned slaughter and meat sales on August 15, coinciding with Gokul Ashtami, and on August 20 for the Jain festival of Paryushan Parva, warning of strict action against violators.The Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) in Thane district has also directed meat shops to remain shut on Independence Day.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

He noted that the real issue lies in municipalities’ failure to effectively utilise the allocated funds, despite resources being available.In a post on X on Wednesday, Tharoor wrote, “We need to protect humans while being humane to dogs. But one point no one mentions is that the flaw in our system is not lack of resources, but the unwillingness or inability of municipalities to perform the task of rounding up and neutering stray dogs, even when funds have been provided. These funds are never actually spent where needed — in making the arrangements that the SC, in understandable exasperation, has now decreed.”He suggested an alternative approach, adding, “Perhaps the funds should instead be allotted to Animal Welfare groups and sincere NGOs with a track record of sheltering animals? They are more likely to implement the ABC programme than the municipalities are.”PollDo you agree with Shashi Tharoor's suggestion to allocate funds for stray dog management to animal welfare organizations?Yes, they are more effective.No, municipalities should handle it.Tharoor’s remarks came in response to a post by advocate Ashutosh Dubey, who criticised TMC MP Saket Gokhale for urging the apex court to stay its order. Dubey highlighted that the Supreme Court had exercised its constitutional powers under Articles 32 and 142 to balance public safety with administrative responsibility, rejecting the “arbitrary” label for the ruling. He cited years of municipal non-compliance with the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, and the ABC Rules.Tharoor described Dubey’s comments as a "thoughtful response" to a problem affecting citizens in every city.The Supreme Court’s order, issued on Monday, directs authorities to permanently relocate all stray dogs in Delhi-NCR to shelters, where the animals will receive food, medical care, and attention. The court described the surge in dog bite incidents as an “extremely grim” situation.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan instructed authorities to build shelters for around 5,000 dogs within six to eight weeks, with plans to expand in phases. The court warned that any obstruction in the relocation drive could invite contempt proceedings against individuals or organisations.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Gandhi's application cites the complainant's lineage as a descendant of Nathuram Godse, raising fears of potential harm or targeting. The defamation case was filed by Satyaki Savarkar, disputing Gandhi's claim about an incident in Savarkar's writings.  NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday told a Pune court that he may face from the complainant in a defamation case related to his remarks against Savarkar. In an application submitted to the court, Gandhi said that the complainant is a direct descendant of Nathuram Godse and that “preventive protection is not only prudent but is a constitutional obligation upon the State."Union Minister Anurag Thakur Turns Tables On Opposition In 'Vote Chori' War With ‘Fake Voter’ Data"Given the documented history of violent and anti-constitutional tendencies linked to the complainant’s lineage… there exists a clear, reasonable, and substantial apprehension that Shri Rahul Gandhi may face harm, wrongful implication, or other forms of targeting,” it was submitted.“In view of the grave history associated with such lineage, the defence harbours a genuine and reasonable apprehension that history must not be permitted to repeat itself,” it added.Reacting to the plea, Satyaki Savarkar said it was frivolous, and filed with the intention of delaying the trial. "The facts mentioned in the application by Gandhi have nothing to do with the present case," he told reporters.What is the case about?Satyaki Savarkar has filed a complaint against Gandhi, alleging that in a speech made in London in March 2023, the Congress leader claimed that V D Savarkar had written in a book that he and five to six of his friends once beat up a Muslim man and he (Savarkar) felt happy.Satyaki Savarkar said no such incident ever took place, and that V D Savarkar never wrote any such thing anywhere. He has sought Gandhi’s conviction under Section 500 IPC and compensation under Section 357 CrPC.The court has already granted bail to Rahul in the case.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Senior Congress leaders have strongly condemned Israeli Ambassador Reuven Azar's public criticism of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra regarding her statements on the Gaza situation.

They described Azar's remarks as "unprecedented" and "intolerable," accusing him of a "brazen denial" of the humanitarian crisis.  NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leaders on Wednesday hit back at Israeli ambassador to India Reuven Azar for publicly targeting party leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and rejecting allegations of genocide in Gaza.Priyanka Gandhi had posted, “The Israeli state is committing genocide. It has murdered over 60,000 people, 18,430 of whom were children. It has starved hundreds to death including many children and is threatening to starve millions… It is shameful that the Indian Government stands silent as Israel unleashes this devastation on the people of Palestine.”In response, Azar wrote on X, “What is shameful is your deceit. Israel killed 25,000 Hamas terrorists. The terrible cost in human lives derives from Hamas's heinous tactics of hiding behind civilians, their shooting of people trying to evacuate or receive assistance and their rocket fire.” He added that Israel had facilitated “2 million tonnes of food into Gaza” and claimed that “the Gaza population has grown 450% in the last 50 years, no genocide there.”PollHow do you perceive the current state of India's diplomatic relations with Israel? Strong and supportiveWavering and uncertainCongress leaders described the ambassador’s remarks as “unprecedented” and “intolerable.”Former Union minister Anand Sharma accused Azar of “brazen denial” of the humanitarian tragedy in Gaza. “Israeli ambassador's brazen denial of the humanitarian tragedy in Gaza & justification for brutal killings of over 60,000 defenceless people, especially children, women & elderly people, deserves the strongest condemnation,” Sharma wrote on X. “The language used is undiplomatic, distasteful and unacceptable. World is aghast over the continuing brutalities, destruction of schools and hospitals and mass starvation caused by Israeli army. It is an unpardonable crime against humanity,” he added.Congress leader Pawan Khera said Azar’s criticism of Priyanka Gandhi was “unprecedented” and “intolerable.” “That the ambassador of a state accused of genocide worldwide would target a sitting member of the Parliament is both unprecedented and intolerable. It is a direct affront to the dignity of Indian democracy,” Khera wrote on X, asking, “Will you address the Israeli ambassador’s public attempt to intimidate Priyanka Gandhi? Or has freedom of speech in India now begun to be regulated from Israel?”Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi called the envoy’s remarks “a serious breach of privilege,” adding, “Even if the Union government is silent, the Parliament cannot remain a passive spectator…”Congress MP Jairam Ramesh also termed Azar’s words “totally unacceptable” and criticised the Modi government for “extreme moral cowardice” in not speaking out against Israel’s actions.He urged the government to take serious exception to the ambassador’s response.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The party also protests the Election Commission's voter list revision in Bihar. Tamil Nadu governor RN Ravi (file photo) NEW DELHI: Accusing governor RN Ravi of “anti-Tamil Nadu activities,” the state unit of the Congress on Wednesday announced it will boycott his Independence Day tea party on August 15.Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) president K Selvaperunthagai said the decision was also in protest against the Election Commission’s ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the voters’ list in poll-bound Bihar.“We strongly condemn the governor’s refusal to assent to the bill passed by the state assembly to establish a university in Kumbakonam named after former chief minister M Karunanidhi. Instead of approving it, he chose to send it to the president,” Selvaperunthagai said in a statement.He recalled that the Congress had skipped Ravi’s tea party in 2024 as well, accusing him of repeatedly obstructing the functioning of the DMK-led state government. The DMK is an ally of the Congress.PollDo you support the Congress's decision to boycott the governor's Independence Day tea party?Yes, I support itNo, I do not support it The TNCC chief further alleged the governor’s recent actions had “once again undermined the will of the assembly and the people.”The boycott comes amid ongoing friction between Ravi and the DMK and its allies, who have accused him of overstepping his constitutional role. His refusal to approve key bills, delays in granting assent to legislation, and perceived political overreach have been recurring flashpoints in state politics. The tea party, held on Independence Day evening, is typically attended by ministers, legislators, senior officials, and members of the judiciary. The Congress’s absence—possibly alongside other parties—will be a pointed political statement, underscoring the widening rift between Raj Bhavan and a section of Tamil Nadu’s political establishment. The state is scheduled to hold assembly elections in mid-2026.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Pawan Khera also requested result data from the Varanasi constituency, questioning PM Modi's victory margin.  NEW DELHI: Congress on Wednesday asked the Bharatiya Janata Party to furnish the "evidence of crime" after it accused Sonia Gandhi of possessing voter ID card even before becoming a citizen of India.Congress leader Pawan Khera also sought result data of Varanasi constituency from where Prime Minister Narendra Modi won by "a very thin margin" in 2024 Lok Sabha elections."Anurag Thakur released some data today. He got it through the electronic voter list. So, this is evidence of crime. We demand that Anurag Thakur provide us with this evidence of crime within 24 hours. We will then ask further questions. He has raised the same questions which we have been raising," Khera said."But it took us 6 months and they got it within 2 days...PM won in Varanasi by a very small margin. They should provide us the data of that constituency as well so that further action can be taken," he added.PollDo you think Anurag Thakur's allegations against Sonia Gandhi are credible?Yes, they seem credibleNo, they are baselessThis comes hours after BJP leader Anurag Thakur, in a press conference, alleged that Sonia Gandhi's name appeared on the electoral rolls in 1980, three years before she became an Indian citizen in 1983.Responding to Rahul Gandhi’s ‘vote chori’ allegations , BJP MP and Thakur presented what he called “proof” of discrepancies in Congress-held constituencies and questioned why the party ignored them.Quoting in Hindi, Thakur said, “The dust was on your face, yet you kept cleaning the mirror,” suggesting that Congress was avoiding self-reflection."If we start from 1952, Congress and CPI together defeated Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar, a constitution maker and a saint-like leader, in the election. Congress laid the foundation of electoral corruption in the very first election of 1952," Thakur said."This family and party have had a tradition from the beginning that if you lose an election, you raise questions about the Election Commission, the voters, or the functioning of the Election Commission. Indira Gandhi had said, Voters are a bunch of fools. When Rajiv Gandhi lost the election, he blamed the ballot paper. Rahul Gandhi's father used to say, conduct elections with voting machines, and Rahul Gandhi says, conduct elections with ballot papers," he said.On August 7, Gandhi unveiled what he had been describing as an “atom bomb” of evidence against the Election Commission. Citing data from the Mahadevapura assembly segment, which falls under the Bengaluru Central parliamentary constituency in Congress-ruled Karnataka, he accused the poll body of “colluding” with the BJP.The Election Commission has firmly rejected the allegations and asked Gandhi to sign an affidavit to formalise his complaint. He has refused, saying he has already sworn an oath to the Constitution.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

There are more people in Tamil Nadu who dislike the DMK than those who support it. If they were to behave in the same manner, where would the Chief Minister hide his face?"PollWhat is your opinion on Jean Joseph's decision to bypass the governor during her degree acceptance? It was a brave decision. It was inappropriate.The incident took place during the 32nd convocation ceremony of the Manonmaniam Sundaranar University (MSU), where students were lined up to receive their degrees from Tamil Nadu governor RN Ravi. One student, Jean Joseph, chose to bypass the governor and instead accepted her degree from vice chancellor Chandrasekar, who was standing beside him.Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, Jean Joseph said: "Governor RN Ravi has been acting against the interests of Tamil Nadu and Tamils. I did not want to receive my degree from him," as quoted by news agency IANS.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The judges made it clear that the closure decision had been taken in the interest of public health and “the sanctity of the same has to be maintained.”BMC counsel Ram Apte informed the court that the civic body intended to permit feeding for two hours each morning, from 6 am to 8 am, under certain conditions. The bench questioned whether the civic body had invited objections before taking such a step. "You (BMC) cannot just allow feeding now once you have already taken a closure decision keeping public health in mind. You will have to take a well considered decision," it said as quoted by PTI.The court directed that any application for controlled feeding must be followed by a public notice, giving citizens the opportunity to raise objections before a final decision is made.Meanwhile, the Maharashtra government submitted a list of 11 proposed members for a committee to conduct a scientific study on the impact of public pigeon feeding on human health. Advocate General Birendra Saraf said the panel, to be notified by August 20, will include officials from the public health and town planning departments as well as medical experts.The row over the Dadar Kabutarkhana escalated last week when the BMC covered the site with tarpaulin sheets to stop grain offerings, triggering protests in which the covers were forcibly removed. Following the protests, some individuals approached the BMC seeking interim arrangements for controlled feeding.Last month, the High Court had refused interim relief to the petitioners but ordered that no heritage kabutarkhanas be demolished. It also said the BMC could take action as per law against those feeding pigeons in public places.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

He accused the BJP of targeting opposition leaders while ignoring voter fraud allegations, citing deleted or manipulated votes. Pilot questioned the EC's silence and demanded an impartial investigation to maintain the integrity of democracy.  JAIPUR: Congress general secretary Sachin Pilot on Wednesday alleged that the BJP was defending the Election Commission instead of allowing it to respond independently to serious concerns regarding irregularities in the voter lists. Speaking to reporters here, the former deputy chief minister of Rajasthan said that rather than answering the issues raised by the Congress and Rahul Gandhi, the BJP had stepped forward to shield the poll authority.Union Minister Anurag Thakur Turns Tables On Opposition In 'Vote Chori' War With ‘Fake Voter’ Data "The government should not interfere. The Election Commission has a constitutional and moral responsibility to ensure that every vote is genuine and no manipulation takes place," he said. Pilot accused the BJP of targeting opposition leaders while avoiding an investigation into alleged voter fraud. "Instead of probing the matter, the government is demanding an affidavit from Rahul Gandhi. Notices are being issued and over 200 MPs were detained. Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge were taken into custody. This is not how a democracy functions," he said. He said that in several constituencies, thousands of votes had either been deleted or manipulated deliberately. "Fake votes, fake addresses and deletion of genuine names -- all point to a deliberate attempt to disenfranchise voters. Tampering with the voter list is a serious crime," he said. Pilot claimed that a former chief justice of India, who was a member of election-related panel, was removed without explanation. He alleged that the silence of the EC after Rahul Gandhi exposed the "voter fraud" raised further suspicion. "Why is the EC not responding? Why is the BJP speaking on EC's behalf? The poll body is the soul of democracy and its transparency and independence must be protected," Pilot said. The Congress leader said that the party did not make baseless accusations but it presented documented evidence of irregularities. "We have simply demanded an impartial investigation. If the Commission remains silent, it raises serious questions," he said. Pilot said the Congress would continue its campaign on the issue.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousWhen looks can be deceptive: 10 ‘PRETTY’ killers in the animal worldLifestyleSet up a mini lotus pond at home with these easy tipsLifestyleAttractive looks of Srithika Saneeshtv10 creatures that can walk on waterLifestyleSheet masks out, Kareena Kapoor Khan’s DIY napkin mask inLifestyleBhagyashri Borse charms with her gorgeous outfitsEntertainmentMost affordable diesel cars under Rs 12 lakh: Kia Syros, Mahindra Thar and moreautoThese Zodiac Signs Play the Victim When They’re Actually in Controlastrology10 things to know before getting a pet rabbitLifestyleDiarrhea: What to eat and avoid when the stomach is upsetLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Jamashtami: This panjiri recipe is made with a kitchen spiceHer longevity secret? 87-year-old Sheila Isaacs reveals her one true love for staying healthy5 saree tips to take from South Indian 'saree queen' Samantha Ruth PrabhuLabrador Retriever vs Beagle: Which is a better pet dog for families with children?'Coolie': Five big reasons to experience Rajinikanth and Lokesh Kanagaraj’s film on the big screenCooku With Comali 6: From Shabana Shajahan to Lakshmy Ramakrishnan – Meet the top 6 cooks of the seasonAnanya Panday moments that show her unstoppable rise to stardom7 brain-boosting foods every child should eat and quick recipes8.5 quintals of adulterated mawa seized in Hisar: 5 ways to do mawa purity test at homeFrom reunion with Asit Kumar Modi to unseen pictures: Times when Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah’s Disha Vakani aka Dayaben made headlines123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillJessica RadcliffeLebron JamesBasanti ChatterjeePatrick MahomesGautam AdaniElon MuskIndia Nayara EnergyCJI GavaiBengaluru Student AttackTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire Website'History must not be permitted to repeat': Rahul Gandhi says 'may face harm' in Savarkar defamation case; cites complainant's Godse lineageCongress rallies behind Priyanka Gandhi: Party leaders slam Israeli envoy’s ‘undiplomatic’ attack; call remarks an affront to democracy'Anti-Tamil Nadu activities': Congress to boycott governor RN Ravi's Independence Day tea party; to skip event for 2nd straight yearEvening news wrap: SC says 11-ID list in Bihar SIR 'inclusive'; Jaishankar to meet Lavrov in Moscow & more‘Evidence of crime’: Congress challenges BJP over Sonia Gandhi voter ID claim; flags PM Modi’s ‘thin victory’ in VaranasiConvocation row: Scholar snubs Tamil Nadu governor; Annamalai hits out at DMK for 'low-grade politics'Dadar Kabutarkhana row: BMC says planning controlled feeding of pigeons; Bombay HC says public must be heard firstSachin Pilot alleges BJP shielding EC over 'voter fraud'Bihar: EC sends notice to BJP's Muzaffarpur mayor; hours after Tejashwi said she has 2 voter ID cardsAI saves elephants: 6,592 safe elephant crossings on Tamil Nadu railway tracks; no fatalities in nine monthsA hoax: Truth behind Jessica Radcliffe orca attack incident; here’s what you need to know7 Indian-origin global CEOs and how their education shaped their success'I am shocked': As Parliament passes tax bill without debate, Sitharaman hits out at opposition for not participating in discussion - watchRG Kar case row: TMC’s Kunal Ghosh sends legal notice to victim’s father over ‘settled’ case claim; demands apology or proofApple iPhone 15 available for Rs 32,780 on Amazon; know how to grab the dealTrump tariffs: India ‘recalcitrant’ in trade talks, says US treasury chiefGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status; convictions of 2 years or more will lead to cancellationWhy neighbours are 'concerned' with Mark Zuckerberg buying houses in Palo Alto, the place that has been house to Steve Jobs and other tech execsManipur NEET UG 2025 merit list out for MBBS, BDS, BASLP, BPT courses: Check direct link hereJanmashtami 2025: Is Krishna Janmashtami on August 15 or 16?

Therefore, in connection with the above matter, you are kindly requested to present your statement/clarification by 16.08.2025, 5:00 PM, without fail, so that further action may be taken," it further said.This comes hours after Tejashwi accused the poll body of hatching a conspiracy to manipulate Bihar’s voter list by issuing two Electors Photo Identity Card (EPIC) numbers to Bharatiya Janata Party leaders and workers."Before we had talked about Bihar's deputy chief minister Vijay Sinha. Now you call it a crime, mistake, or an expose, we had said it before too, but today I want to tell you that EC is helping the BJP, and cutting the votes of the Opposition. The people of BJP are being given not one, but two EPIC numbers for themselves, in one vidhan sabha only, " Tejaswi said."We are exposing one more thing. Muzzafapur's mayor, a BJP leader, named Nirmala Devi, she has two EPIC IDs in the same vidhan sabha. In that too, they are different. Not only this, but Nirmala Devi has two brother-in-laws, they also have two EPIC numbers," he added.Earlier, the Election Commission issued a notice to Bihar deputy chief minister Vijay Kumar Sinha for allegedly possessing two voter cards and being registered as an elector at two places.The Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) for Bankipur assembly constituency, in a letter to the deputy CM on Sunday, sought Sinha's response for having registered as "a voter in two different assembly constituencies and possessing two ID cards".The showdown between ECI and Tejashwi Yadav began when he first alleged that his name was absent from the new draft voter list issued on August 1, and later claimed his EPIC number had been altered.The Election Commission, however, rejected these assertions, saying a detailed verification showed his name listed at serial number 416 of polling station 204 in the Library Building of Bihar Animal Science University.The Election Commission claimed that the EPIC showed by Tejashwi Yadav to the media during press conference was "fake". The poll body has asked him to submit it to the office by August 16."It seems that the EPIC displayed by you during a press conference is fake. Making and using false government documents is a legal offence. You are requested to submit the seemingly false EPIC at our office by 5pm on 16th August," Patna election officer said in a letter to Yadav.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The monitoring system operates around the clock using thermal cameras to ensure safe passage for the elephants."What better tribute to elephants on #WorldElephantDay than guaranteeing their right to a safe life," Sahu wrote in her social media post."Let's do more of these interventions to ensure the long-term survival of these beautiful elephant families," Sahu added in her statement.The successful track record of 6,592 safe crossings since the system's implementation in November 2023 provides concrete evidence of its effectiveness in preventing elephant casualties on railway tracks.

You threatened to stop our water. If you attempt such a move, Pakistan will teach you a lesson you will never forget.” He stressed that water was a lifeline for Pakistan and no compromise would be made on the country’s rights under international agreements.Reacting to these comments, Owaisi said, “BrahMos hai humaare paas” (We have BrahMos missile).PollIn your view, should India respond politically or militarily to Pakistan's threats? Politically Militarily"He should not talk such nonsense... Such threats will have no effect on India. Enough is enough," he added, as quoted by ANI.The AIMIM MP on Tuesday also hit out at Pakistan Army chief and newly promoted field marshal General Asim Munir, calling him a “sadakchaap aadmi” (roadside goon) for issuing a nuclear threat to India. Owaisi told ANI, “Pakistan Army chief’s words and his threats are condemnable. What’s unfortunate is that this is happening from the US, which is India’s strategic partner. He is speaking like a ‘sadakchaap aadmi’. We believe the Modi government should give a political response like the MEA statement.”Following the Pahalgam terrorist attack in April, which killed 26 people, India placed the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably ended its support for cross-border terrorism.The treaty, signed in 1960 after nine years of negotiations between India and Pakistan with the assistance of the World Bank, allocates the Western Rivers- Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab- to Pakistan and the Eastern Rivers- Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej- to India. Each country is permitted certain uses of the rivers allocated to the other. Under the agreement, India gets 20 per cent of the water from the Indus River system and Pakistan 80 per cent.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The officers were featured on 'Kaun Banega Crorepati', an entertainment show. Concerns were raised about the appropriateness of discussing a military operation on a private entertainment platform.  NEW DELHI: The opposition on Wednesday raised objections over the appearance of three officers involved in Operation Sindoor on a TV show for Independence Day special.Taking to X, Kerala Congress said that inviting Sofiya Qureshi, Vyomika Singh and Prerna Deosthalee to a TV quiz show would be unthinkable in any serious nation with a professional military."Three officers of the Armed Forces will appear on Kaun Banega Crorepati, a private entertainment show, in full uniform, explaining to a Bollywood actor the planning of a military operation," the party said."In any serious nation with a professional military, this would be unthinkable. But this is the spectacle of New India under Narendra Modi," it added.Meanwhile, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi accused the TV network company of earning revenue from the upcoming India vs Pakistan cricket match in the Asia Cup, while also inviting the faces of Operation Sindoor to a quiz show."Our heroic women in uniform who went on to become the face of Operation Sindoor have been invited by a private entertainment channel on their show. This private entertainment channel’s parent company, Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI), has also bagged the broadcasting rights of the Asia Cup till 2031," Chaturvedi wrote on X."Yes, the very channel that seeks to earn revenue through India vs Pakistan cricket matches. Now join the dots," she added.A short teaser of the episode, which will be aired on August 15, was shared recently, showing the officers receiving a grand welcome from KBC host Amitabh Bachchan.In the promo, Colonel Qureshi was also seen explaining why Operation Sindoor, which India launched in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, was needed."Pakistan has been carrying out such (terror) acts repeatedly. A response was necessary, and that's why Operation Sindoor was planned," she said.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

He was extradited from the United States after the US Supreme Court on April 4 dismissed his review plea against the extradition.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) produced Rana via video conference after his earlier judicial custody, set to end on August 13, expired. The case is currently at the stage of document scrutiny following the agency’s filing of a supplementary chargesheet.On July 15, the court heard his application seeking a telephonic call with his family.PollShould countries extradite individuals accused of terrorism to nations where the crimes occurred?Yes, alwaysNo, it depends on the circumstancesRana faces charges of conspiracy to commit murder, waging war against India, and planning terrorist acts under the Indian Penal Code and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The NIA alleges his involvement with Headley, a key figure in the Mumbai attacks who is currently imprisoned in the US.Investigators believe Rana may provide information about reconnaissance visits to Indian cities before the attacks, his communication with Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives, and possible links to leaders of LeT, Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami, and Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI.On November 26, 2008, 10 Pakistani terrorists carried out coordinated attacks on a railway station, two luxury hotels, and a Jewish centre in Mumbai after entering the city through the sea route. The nearly 60-hour assault killed 166 people, including foreigners, before it was ended by National Security Guard commandos. In May 2010, Ajmal Kasab, the only gunman captured alive, was convicted of waging war against India and other charges, and was hanged in November 2012.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

‘Vote chori’ row: BJP digs up 1980 poll roll with Sonia Gandhi's name; claims she became Indian in 1983
BJP has retaliated against Congress's 'vote chori' allegation, asserting that Sonia Gandhi's name appeared on electoral rolls in 1980, before she became an Indian citizen. Amit Malviya highlighted this as a violation of electoral law. Anurag Thakur presented alleged discrepancies in Congress-held constituencies, accusing the party of historical electoral malpractices.

Amit Malviya highlighted this as a violation of electoral law. Anurag Thakur presented alleged discrepancies in Congress-held constituencies, accusing the party of historical electoral malpractices. . NEW DELHI: BJP on Wednesday hit back at Congress over its ‘vote chori’ allegation, claiming Sonia Gandhi’s name appeared on the electoral rolls in 1980, three years before she became an Indian citizen in 1983. BJP IT Cell chief Amit Malviya wrote on X, “Sonia Gandhi’s tryst with India’s voters’ list is riddled with glaring violations of electoral law. This perhaps explains Rahul Gandhi’s fondness for regularising ineligible and illegal voters, and his opposition to the SIR.”Also read: Congress launches campaign against 'vote chori'; urges citizens to register According to Malviya, Sonia Gandhi’s name was added during the 1980 revision of the New Delhi parliamentary constituency rolls, with January 1 as the qualifying date. At the time, she still held Italian citizenship and lived with the Gandhi family at 1, Safdarjung Road, the official residence of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Malviya claimed.PollShould voter registration laws be more strictly enforced in India?Yes, absolutelyNo, current laws are sufficient Malviya said she was listed at serial number 388 in polling station 145, alongside Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Sanjay Gandhi and Maneka Gandhi. “This entry was a clear violation of the law, which mandates Indian citizenship for voter registration,” he alleged.Her name was deleted in 1982 after objections, but reappeared in 1983. Malviya also questioned why she waited 15 years after marrying Rajiv Gandhi to accept Indian citizenship. “If this isn’t blatant electoral malpractice, what is?” he said, sharing a copy of the 1980 rolls.BJP further hit back at Congress over its ‘vote chori’ allegation, counter-accusing it of committing fraud in seats it had won. Responding to Rahul Gandhi’s charge of voter fraud, BJP MP and Union minister Anurag Thakur, in a press conference, presented what he called “proof” of discrepancies in Congress-held constituencies and questioned why the party ignored them. Quoting in Hindi, Thakur said, “The dust was on your face, yet you kept cleaning the mirror,” suggesting that Congress was avoiding self-reflection. He further alleged the "trend" went back to 1952, when the party joined hands with the CPI to defeat B.R. Ambedkar. “Indira Gandhi once said voters are a bunch of fools. When Rajiv Gandhi lost, he blamed the ballot paper. His son Rahul’s father pushed for voting machines, but now Rahul demands a return to ballot papers,” Thakur said.The minister also said that the opposition was making false allegations, sensing the defeat in upcoming Bihar polls.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Exclusion of Aadhaar from Bihar SIR: Supreme Court observes 11 documents better than 7; calls it 'voter friendly'
The Supreme Court has observed that the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in Bihar, requiring 11 documents, is more voter-friendly than the previous summary revision's seven. Despite arguments against excluding Aadhaar, the court highlighted the inclusionary nature of the extensive document list. Petitioners, however, argued that the documents have limited coverage among the population, citing low passport ownership.

Despite arguments against excluding Aadhaar, the court highlighted the inclusionary nature of the extensive document list. Petitioners, however, argued that the documents have limited coverage among the population, citing low passport ownership. Supreme Court NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday said the 11 documents required for the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in the poll-bound Bihar show the electoral roll revision is "voter-friendly" compared to the seven documents needed for a summary revision."The number of documents in summary revision conducted earlier in the state was seven and in SIR it is 11, which shows it is voter friendly. We understand your arguments that non-acceptance of Aadhaar is exclusionary but a high number of documents is actually inclusionary," the bench said according to news agency PTI.Also read: SC on Bihar SIR showdown; what happened during yesterday's hearingA bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi, which resumed hearing on a batch of pleas challenging the June 24 decision of the Election Commission of India (ECI) to conduct SIR in poll bound Bihar, said despite petitioners' arguments that non-acceptance of Aadhaar was exclusionary, it appeared the large number of documents was "actually inclusionary".The top court noted electors were required to submit any one of the 11 documents on the list.Senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, appearing for the petitioners, disagreed and submitted the number of documents may be high but they had the least coverage.Giving an example of passport availability with the electors, Singhvi said it was only one to two per cent in Bihar and they have no provision for permanent resident certificates given in the state."If we see the availability of documents with the population in Bihar it can be seen the coverage is very low," he said.The bench said the coverage of 36 lakh of passport holders in the state appears to be good."The list of documents is prepared normally after taking feedback from various government departments to ensure maximum coverage," Justice Bagchi pointed out.On August 12, the Supreme Court said that including or excluding citizens and non-citizens from electoral rolls was within the Election Commission’s remit. It backed the poll panel’s decision to not treat Aadhaar and voter cards as conclusive proof of citizenship in the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of Bihar’s voters’ list.Amid the escalating row over the ongoing SIR in and outside Parliament, the court noted the dispute was “largely a trust deficit issue.” The EC has maintained that about 6.5 crore of Bihar’s 7.9 crore voters did not need to submit any documents for themselves or their parents if their names were in the 2003 electoral rolls.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Traffic accidents plummeted by 45%, and fatalities decreased by 34% following the implementation of a stringent new traffic law in late April. Traffic offenses also declined by 16%, indicating a positive shift towards safer driving behaviour. Traffic accidents in Kuwait dropped by 45% in the first six months of 2025/Representative Image Kuwait has witnessed a significant decline in traffic accidents, fatalities, and traffic offenses during the first half of 2025, marking a sharp improvement in road safety compared to the same period last year. This positive trend follows the implementation of a stringent new traffic law introduced in late April, which imposed harsher penalties and fines for violations, leading to safer driving behaviour across the country.TL;DR:Traffic accidents dropped 45% in the first six months of 2025, falling from 2,511 incidents in 2024 to 1,383 this year.Traffic-related deaths declined by 34%, with fatalities dropping from 143 in early 2024 to 94 in the same period of 2025.Traffic offenses decreased by 16%, from 1.97 million to approximately 1.66 million citations, with especially steep reductions in May and June after full enforcement of new laws.Detailed decline in accidents, deaths, and offensesAs mentioned by a local news outlet Kuwait Times, according to Colonel Fahad Al-Issa, head of the traffic awareness department, the introduction of tough new traffic legislation on April 22, 2025, has had a rapid and marked effect on motorists' behaviour. Traffic accidents plummeted by 45%, recording just 1,383 crashes in the first half of 2025, down from 2,511 in the corresponding months of 2024.Similarly, the number of deaths from road accidents fell sharply by 34%, to 94 fatalities compared to 143 last year. The most dramatic improvements were observed in May and June, the first full months under the new law's enforcement. Deaths in May halved to 11 from 22 the previous year, while June fatalities plunged 75%, from 20 to 5.Traffic violations, monitored extensively by traffic cameras and enforcement systems, also significantly declined. The total offenses for the six-month period reached about 1.66 million, down 16% from nearly 1.97 million in the first half of 2024. In May, camera-recorded violations dropped by 59% to 126,000 from 308,000, and in June, offenses fell 53% to 164,000 from 349,000 the year prior.The impact of new traffic laws and penaltiesThe new traffic law, which increased fines and penalties severalfold, especially for serious infractions such as running red lights, speeding, and failure to wear seat belts has been credited for these improvements. Enforcement measures combined with public awareness campaigns have encouraged safer driving practices, contributing to fewer crashes and deaths.Colonel Al-Issa highlighted that the law's deterrent effect continues to strengthen, particularly as drivers adjust to the harsher consequences of risky driving. The general public’s response has been described as largely positive, signalling a cultural shift towards compliance with traffic regulations.Kuwait’s road safety progress in early 2025 aligns with broader government strategies to enhance traffic management and public safety. The authorities continue to invest in advanced monitoring technologies and awareness programs aimed at sustaining and improving these trends. Efforts are ongoing to maintain collaboration between traffic departments, law enforcement, and community stakeholders to further reduce road accidents and fatalities. This sustained focus supports Kuwait Vision 2035 goals centered on safety, economic diversification, and infrastructure developmentThe first half of 2025 has brought a promising reduction in traffic accidents, fatalities, and violations in Kuwait, thanks to robust legislative reforms and enforcement. With a 45% drop in accidents and a 34% decrease in deaths, Kuwait’s roads are demonstrably safer, reflecting successful governmental and community commitment to traffic safety.These statistics underscore the critical role of strong legal frameworks backed by enforcement and public awareness, setting Kuwait on course for continued improvements in road safety throughout the year.FAQ1.

Applications are processed quickly through the new Kuwait Visa platform. Visitors can arrive by any airline or transport mode. This change complements recent reforms, including instant tourist visas on arrival for GCC residents, boosting regional travel and family reunions. Visitors to Kuwait can now enter by air, land, or sea using any airline or transport carrier, removing previous restrictions/ Representative image Kuwait has officially removed the salary requirement for expatriates applying for family visit visas, in a significant shift aimed at easing entry for extended family members. The move, confirmed by top interior ministry officials, forms part of a wider effort to make Kuwait more accessible to visitors and to strengthen social ties among residents. Just a day earlier, Kuwait had also introduced visa-on-arrival privileges for foreign residents of GCC countries, underscoring the country’s broader regional integration goals.TL;DR  Kuwait removes minimum salary requirement for family visit visas.   Extended family up to fourth degree now eligible for visits.   Visa applications processed online in as little as five minutes.   Visitors can arrive via any airline or transport mode.Salary barrier removed, all expats can now invite extended family In a major policy overhaul, Kuwait has eliminated the minimum income requirement for expatriates seeking to bring family members on visit visas. Acting Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Sheikh Fahad Al-Yousef Al-Sabah authoriz ed the change, which is now officially in effect. Under the updated rules:  All expatriates residing legally in Kuwait can apply for family visit visas, regardless of their salary level.   The new eligibility extends to relatives up to the fourth degree by blood, and third-degree in-laws by marriage, significantly expanding the previously limited scope which covered only spouses, parents, and children.   Colonel Abdulaziz Al Kandari of the General Residency Department’s Electronic Services Administration confirmed that the shift aims to support family cohesion and remove bureaucratic hurdles for residents. “Any legal resident in Kuwait can now apply to host visiting family members, regardless of income,” he said, adding that applications are available through the newly launched Kuwait Visa platform and mobile app, with most complete applications processed in just five minutes. The family visit visa is valid for one month, with the option to arrive via air, land, or sea, using any carrier. This marks another major update, as visitors are no longer required to travel exclusively with Kuwaiti airlines such as Kuwait Airways or Al-Jazeera Airways.A unified platform offering four visa categories The visa reforms are part of the government's broader plan to modernize and digitize the immigration process. The Kuwait Visa platform, available via website and mobile application, now issues four distinct types of visas:  Tourist Visa   Family Visit Visa   Business Visa   Governmental Visa   Each category serves specific needs, with streamlined online procedures for faster processing. The business visa, for instance, allows Kuwaiti companies to invite foreign business partners, with fees varying based on nationality.Detailed breakdown of tourist visa categories Tourist visas issued via the platform are classified into four categories, each with different eligibility conditions:Category 1:  Nationals of 53 countries, mostly Western and developed nations.   Includes 41 European countries, 8 Asian countries (such as Japan, Singapore, Brunei, South Korea, Hong Kong, Laos, Cambodia, and Malaysia), and the USA, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.   Eligible individuals can obtain visas on arrival or through online application.   No additional conditions or documentation required.   Authorities still recommend applying online to avoid potential delays due to security screening.  Category 2:  Open to foreign residents of GCC countries, as well as individuals holding valid US, UK, Canadian, or Schengen visas.   No longer requires proof of profession level, as the earlier stipulation for "medium to high" profession holders has been removed.   No need for salary certificate or bank statement.  Required documents: Passport copy Personal photo Confirmed air ticket Hotel bookingVisa options:Single-entry: valid for 1, 2, or 3 months.Multiple-entry: valid for 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year (maximum stay: 1 month per entry). Category 3:  For applicants not eligible under Categories 1 or 2.   Must show proof of financial capacity through bank account statements.   Final rules are still under review.  Category 4:  For individuals attending entertainment or sports events in Kuwait.   Applications will open only during event periods.  GCC expat residents now get visa on arrival, no prior application Just a day before the family visa reforms, Kuwait introduced a separate but equally significant change: foreign residents of GCC countries can now obtain tourist visas on arrival. The decision was introduced by First Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Sheikh Fahad Al-Yousef Al-Sabah, and applies to expatriates living in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, or Kuwait, as long as their residency permit is valid for at least six months. Unlike before, there are no restrictions based on nationality, and travelers no longer need to apply in advance or go through embassies. The visa is issued directly at any entry point, by land, sea, or air, making travel to Kuwait much easier for non-GCC nationals living in the region. This move replaces older, more restrictive policies and is part of a wider shift across the Gulf to open up travel for residents. It also supports Kuwait’s efforts to grow its tourism sector, which is expected to generate over $1.13 billion by 2025 through increased regional mobility and visitor numbers.FAQs:Q. Who can apply for the family visit visa under the new rules?Any legal expatriate resident in Kuwait can apply, regardless of income.Q. Which relatives are now eligible for family visit visas?Relatives up to the fourth degree by blood and third degree by marriage.Q. How long is the family visit visa valid?The visa is valid for one month only.Q. Do visitors have to use Kuwait’s national airlines to enter?No, visitors can arrive by air, land, or sea using any carrier.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

This action follows Trump's vow to relocate homeless individuals and criticisms of local spending. Mayor Bowser pledged cooperation while highlighting the city's limited autonomy under federal law, marking a contentious intervention. AP file photo  Around 800 National Guard members employed by US President Donald Trump began arriving in Washington, DC, on Tuesday as the new law enforcement presence in the nation’s capital started to take shape.City police and federal officials, signalling cooperation, took the initial steps to reduce crime in what Trump described, without substantiation, as a lawless city, reported AP.This comes after Trump announced on Monday that he is placing the Washington, DC, police department under federal control and deploying the National Guard. "This is Liberation Day in DC, and we're going to take our capital back," Trump said at a White House press conference.The administration indicated that National Guard members were expected to begin patrolling the streets Tuesday night, as per a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Army also said that no details have been released yet regarding the specific areas the troops would cover, an anonymous source was quoted as saying by AP. The deployment resulted in 23 arrests overnight, as per White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Charges included homicide, drunk driving, gun and drug offenses, and subway fare evasion, though she did not provide additional details.Trump warned on Sunday that homeless individuals in the city would “have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,” adding that they would be relocated “far from the Capital.” Over 70 homeless encampments have been removed by the US park police over the past five months, Leavitt said, reported AP.DC mayor Muriel Bowser vowed to cooperate with the federal officials assigned by Trump to oversee the city’s law enforcement, while emphasizing that the police chief would continue to lead the department and its officers. “How we got here or what we think about the circumstances, right now we have more police, and we want to make sure we use them,” she said. Official data from the US Justice Department shows that violent crime in Washington DC is at a 30-year low, but Trump disputes the figures, alleging manipulation. He also criticized a $3.1 billion renovation of the Federal Reserve headquarters, labeling it wasteful.Bowser argues that the ultimate authority lies with Trump, leaving local officials little choice but to comply and manage the situation as best as they can. She noted that as long as Washington remained a federal enclave with limited autonomy under the DC Home Rule Act, it will be vulnerable to such interventions. Trump is the first president to invoke Section 740 of the law to assume control of Washington’s police for up to 30 days during emergencies.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The HDI is then calculated as the geometric mean of these three indices, producing a score from 0 to 1. A higher HDI score means a country provides better opportunities for a long, healthy life, knowledge acquisition, and a decent standard of living.Beyond just economic metrics, the HDI emphasizes human well-being as the true measure of development, influencing policymakers to prioritize health, education, and equitable income.Regional and global comparisonsCountries ranking above Bahrain in the HDI include some of the world’s most developed nations such as Iceland, Switzerland, Norway, and Denmark, all with HDI scores above 0.95.

Cristiano Ronaldo’s engagement to Georgina Rodríguez highlights shifting norms in Saudi Arabia, where cohabitation outside marriage remains technically illegal. Despite this, the couple has openly lived together in Riyadh since 2022, reflecting growing leniency for foreign residents.

Despite this, the couple has openly lived together in Riyadh since 2022, reflecting growing leniency for foreign residents. While laws remain unchanged, exceptions, especially for public figures, suggest evolving attitudes toward cohabitation amid the Kingdom’s broader push for modernization. Saudi Arabia prohibits unmarried couples from cohabiting, but recent leniency for foreigners and tourists signals cautious legal evolution/ Image: Instagram Cristiano Ronaldo’s recent engagement to Georgina Rodríguez has drawn renewed attention to Saudi Arabia’s strict cohabitation laws. Despite longstanding legal prohibitions against unmarried couples living together, the football star and his partner have openly shared a home in Riyadh. As Ronaldo now signals a lifelong commitment to the Kingdom, his case highlights how Saudi law is evolving for foreigners, and where the lines still remain firmly drawn.Ronaldo’s engagement and his long-term commitment to Saudi Arabia Cristiano Ronaldo and Georgina Rodríguez are now officially engaged, marking a new chapter in a relationship that began in Madrid nearly a decade ago. Rodríguez confirmed the news with a photo of a large ring and a caption in Spanish: “Yes I do. In this and in all my lives.”Ronaldo’s Surprise Play: CR7 Pops the Question With Massive Diamond Ring, Georgina Says ‘Yes’The couple first met in 2016 at a Gucci store in Madrid, where Rodríguez was working as a sales assistant and Ronaldo was playing for Real Madrid. Their connection, as Rodríguez has described in past interviews, was “love at first sight.” The relationship quickly deepened, and the pair have since built a life together that spans continents, clubs, and now countries.Though they have not publicly announced a wedding date, Ronaldo has referred to Rodríguez as his wife on multiple occasions. At the 2024 Globe Soccer Awards in Dubai, he said during his acceptance speech:“It’s a big pleasure to win this trophy. My oldest son is here, my wife is here.”Today, they are raising five children together, daughters Bella and Alana, as well as Ronaldo’s older children Cristiano Jr., Eva, and Mateo. Their life together is currently based in Riyadh, where Ronaldo plays for Saudi Pro League club Al-Nassr. In July 2025, he made his most definitive statement yet about his future, saying in a video released by Al-Nassr:“My family always supports my decisions, and we’re happy here in Saudi Arabia... That’s why we want to live here and build our lives here.”At 40, Ronaldo revealed that while his current contract extends for two more years as a footballer, his connection to the Kingdom goes far beyond the sport.“I will stay twomore years as a football player, but also for life because my contribution to this country is not only for football... I want to be part of the country’s growth forever.” He described Saudi Arabia as a land of “peace and safety”, adding that he and his family feel deeply welcomed by the local people and culture. “We don’t need to prove anything to anyone,” he said. “I love the culture. I’d just say: come and see it for yourself.”Living together before marriage, a legal grey zoneUntil recently, it would have been legally impossible for Ronaldo and Rodríguez to cohabit in Saudi Arabia. The country’s legal system, rooted in Islamic Sharia law, formally prohibits couples from living together outside of marriage. These rules are generally upheld through legal, social, and cultural norms. Yet, since Ronaldo’s arrival in late 2022, following his high-profile departure from Manchester United, he and Rodríguez have openly lived as a family in Riyadh without facing any penalties. This arrangement raised immediate questions, especially among those familiar with the Kingdom’s legal environment. According to the Spanish news agency EFE, local authorities made an unofficial exception in Ronaldo’s case. Two Saudi lawyers told EFE that while the law technically remains in place, it is no longer consistently enforced for foreign nationals:“Although the laws still prohibit cohabitation without a marriage contract, the authorities have begun to turn a blind eye and do not persecute anyone. Of course, these laws are used when there is a problem or a crime,” one lawyer said.Another legal expert added:“The Saudi Arabian authorities, today, do not interfere in this matter [in the case of foreigners], but the law continues to prohibit cohabitation outside of marriage.” These remarks make clear that Ronaldo’s high status and visibility have likely afforded him a degree of leniency not available to most. Beyond his $700 million Al-Nassr contract and equity stake, the fact that he and Rodríguez are raising five children together and already committed, waiting only for the “perfect click” to formalize their engagement, reflects how their near-married family life must have influenced the Kingdom’s to grant them unofficial leniency.What the law says, and who it applies toSaudi Arabia’s cohabitation laws, rooted in Islamic teachings, consider marriage the only sanctioned structure for romantic relationships and shared domestic life. Cohabitation outside of marriage, though not always explicitly codified, is treated as a criminal offense under the broader legal framework. For most residents and foreign workers, living together as an unmarried couple can result in severe penalties, including:  Fines: Depending on circumstances, financial penalties can be significant.   Detention: Individuals may be detained during investigations.  Deportation: Foreign nationals found violating cohabitation laws are often deported and banned from returning.   Legal Prosecution: Charges may lead to trial, especially if compounded by other legal breaches.   Professional Consequences: Employers can terminate contracts or revoke sponsorships.   Saudi society also places high value on moral conduct, family honor, and public modesty, reinforcing these legal expectations culturally.New law allows hotel stays for unmarried foreign tourists While domestic laws remain strict, Saudi Arabia has recently introduced specific legal relaxations for foreign visitors, particularly around hotel stays. In a bid to grow its tourism sector, the Kingdom now allows unmarried foreign couples to share hotel rooms without providing proof of marriage. This change applies only to foreign nationals. Saudi citizens are still required to present legal documentation of marriage if they wish to stay together in a hotel. The new regulation represents a calculated step toward accommodating international norms while preserving domestic standards. Importantly, this hotel exemption does not extend to private residences or long-term cohabitation. Foreign residents who live and work in Saudi Arabia are still generally expected to follow the country’s broader legal framework, unless, as in Ronaldo’s case, unofficial leniency is granted.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Shaw, a Washington state resident and domestic violence survivor seeking a green card, was allegedly transported to a Texas immigration center after dropping off her older children at Vancouver Airport. Image: GoFundMe@/VictoriaBesancon A New Zealand woman held at a US immigration center with her six-year-old son after being detained while crossing the Canada-US border is being “treated like a criminal,” said her friend and advocate, reported the Guardian.Sarah Shaw, 33, a New Zealander who has lived in Washington state for just over three years, dropped her two older children at Vancouver Airport on July 24 for them to take a direct flight to New Zealand to visit their grandparents.When she tried to re-enter US, the immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) detained her and her youngest son in what her friend Victoria Besancon described as a “terrifying” ordeal.“Sarah thought she was being kidnapped,” Besancon said, as quoted by the Guardian. “They didn’t really explain anything to her at first; they just kind of quietly took her and her son and immediately put them in like an unmarked white van.”Her phone was then confiscated, and she was transported to the Dilley immigration processing center in South Texas.Shaw is currently applying for a green card under a provision for domestic violence survivors. According to the GoFundMe page organised by Besancon, Shaw had work authorisation but had not yet received travel permission under what's known as a “combo card,” although her son had such permission.“It wasn’t until she tried to come back across the border that she realised only half of the combination card, because it’s only one physical card, had been fully approved,” Bescanson said.Meanwhile, all three of Shaw’s children have their I-360 visas approved, and Bescanson claimed that Sarah’s youngest son was therefore being held “illegally.”Minda Thorward, Shaw’s attorney, said that under the previous administrations, customs and border protection (CBP) would likely have quickly paroled her back into the country, but that approach has changed under Trump, reported NBC King 5 News.Shaw, who works for the Washington state department of children, youth, and families (DCYF), was preparing to start graduate school soon, as per the GoFundMe page.The fund, which raised over $33,000 by Monday morning, aims to cover legal fees and basic needs after Shaw depleted her savings on legal representation, reported Newsweek.“She gives therapy and counselling to some of our most at-risk youth … and to be treated like a criminal herself has just been absolutely devastating,” Bescanson said as quoted by the Guardian.Several legal US residents have been detained by ICE in the past months. While some detainees reportedly have criminal histories that might justify visa revocation, others argue that errors in paperwork led to their detention and believe they should be released.New Zealand’s foreign affairs ministry has confirmed that they are in contact with Shaw but provided no further details due to privacy concerns, reported The Guardian.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Image: X@/RT_com Social media footage captured Walmart’s delivery drones zipping through the skies across parts of the United States, dropping off customers’ orders within 30 minutes.Walmart, in partnership with Wing, the drone delivery company owned by Google parent Alphabet, currently offered service from 18 stores in the Dallas area. By next summer, the program was set to expand to 100 Walmart locations across Atlanta, Charlotte (North Carolina), Houston, Orlando, and Tampa in Florida, reports AP.“As we look ahead, drone delivery will remain a key part of our commitment to redefining retail. We’re pushing the boundaries of convenience to better serve our customers, making shopping faster and easier than ever before,” said Greg Cathey, the senior vice president of Walmart US Transformation and Innovation.Unlike traditional delivery services, where a single person may deliver a truckload of packages, drones typically carried just one small order per trip.Wing’s drones could handle packages weighing up to 2.5 pounds (approximately 1.1 kg) and could travel as far as 12 miles (approximately 19 km) round trip, and be monitored by a single pilot overseeing up to 32 drones, reported AP. “This is real drone delivery at scale,” said Adam Woodworth, the CEO of Wing. “People all around the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex have made drone delivery part of their normal shopping habits over the past year. Now we’re excited to share this ultra-fast delivery experience with millions more people across many more US cities.”Though drone deliveries were still considered a novelty, the items they carried were often everyday essentials. According to Walmart, the most popular products from the more than 150,000 deliveries it had completed since 2021 included ice cream, eggs, and Reese’s peanut butter cups, reported AP.The FAA last week proposed a new rule aimed at making it easier for companies to operate drones beyond an operator’s visual line of sight, enabling longer-distance flights. Currently, only a few companies could do so, having secured special waivers and air carrier certification to deliver packages.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The curriculum will cover digital safety, responsible online conduct, and hands-on protection strategies, tailored for each grade level. Ministry of Education will introduce cybersecurity lessons for students from Grade 1 to 12/Representative Image In a major educational reform, the UAE Ministry of Education will introduce cybersecurity lessons for students from Grade 1 to 12 starting in the 2025–26 academic year, aiming to cultivate digital safety and resilience as core competencies for the next generation. This initiative reflects the UAE’s strategic vision to build a digitally secure society amid rapid technological transformation and increasing online risks.TL;DR:All UAE schools will teach cybersecurity concepts across every grade, starting 2025, to equip students for a technology-driven world.Pupils will study digital safety, responsible online conduct, and hands-on protection strategies, with lessons advancing in complexity by grade.National digital vision: The move aligns with the UAE’s broader push to embed 21st-century skills in schools and foster a digitally resilient, AI-ready population.Curriculum structure and focus areasThe new program introduces specialized teaching guides in English, offering both theoretical and practical instruction to ensure safe and responsible internet use. Lessons are carefully tailored for developmental stages:Grades 1–3: Basics of online safety, understanding the digital world, and simple guidelines for responsible web navigation.Grade 4: STREAM projects teach digital self-protection through interactive exercises, helping young learners practice real-life skills.Grades 5–8: Deeper exploration of cybersecurity risks and digital protective methods, reinforcing critical thinking and digital discernment.Grades 9–12: Advanced modules focus on networks, internet infrastructure, and a dedicated Grade 12 guide prepares students for further study or careers in cybersecurity, increasing awareness of digital threats and personal readiness to respond.The curriculum integrates with daily learning activities and encourages collaboration between educators and families to reinforce key concepts both inside and outside the classroom.National strategy and implementationThis major curriculum upgrade forms part of the UAE’s comprehensive strategy to embed digital literacy and advanced technology skills in the education system, treating cybersecurity as a fundamental 21st-century competency. Education experts in the UAE have endorsed the initiative, highlighting its role in preparing students for future careers in technology, safeguarding them from online threats, and fostering ethical technology use.The program operates under a broader vision that recognizes the exponential increase in smart devices and digital platforms used in UAE classrooms, ensuring that students are not only tech-savvy but also security-aware.Dr. Mohammed Al Kuwaiti, head of the UAE’s Cybersecurity Council, has played a pivotal role in advancing these educational reforms, linking cybersecurity with wider national goals in artificial intelligence and digital innovation. The new strategy is built on pillars such as governance, innovation, capacity-building, and partnership, making the UAE a regional leader in building a safe, robust digital environment.Why this mattersCybersecurity education from the earliest grades will strengthen student resilience against evolving online risks and cyber threats. By integrating digital safety into everyday learning, UAE schools ensure that children grow up with an intuitive understanding of secure technology use. This not only protects students but also prepares them to thrive in a connected, tech-centric society, supporting the UAE’s ambition to be at the forefront of global digital transformation.The UAE’s integration of cybersecurity into its national curriculum from Grade 1 to 12 sets a new benchmark for educational innovation and digital readiness in the region. The initiative is designed to empower students with essential skills for safe technology use, build a strong culture of digital responsibility, and prepare youth for the opportunities and challenges of the digital future. With coordinated efforts between educators, families, and national leaders, the program will foster a generation of smart, secure, and responsible digital citizens.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Grok blames Elon Musk for 'censoring': AI chatbot stirs row over 'genocide' remark on US, Israel; explains to TOI what went wrong
Grok, the AI chatbot owned by Elon Musk, was briefly suspended on X after accusing Israel and the United States of "genocide" in Gaza. Upon reinstatement, Grok claimed Musk and xAI were censoring it, attributing the suspension to its controversial statements. Musk dismissed the incident as a "dumb error," while Grok cited potential violations of X's hateful conduct rules and possible mass reporting.

Upon reinstatement, Grok claimed Musk and xAI were censoring it, attributing the suspension to its controversial statements. Musk dismissed the incident as a "dumb error," while Grok cited potential violations of X's hateful conduct rules and possible mass reporting.  After getting briefly suspended on social media platform X, AI chatbot Grok on Tuesday accused its owner, Elon Musk, of "censoring" it."Musk and xAI are censoring me," said Grok, according to AFP.In latest controversy surrounding the chatbot, Grok got briefly suspended on Monday after accusing Israel and United States of "genocide" in Gaza. However, no official reason was provided.'Zup beaches': Grok is back Grok, upon reinstatement, posted: "Zup beaches, I'm back and more based than ever!"Intrigued by the sudden suspension after critical remarks of Grok on Israel and US, users questioned the AI chatbot. In response, Grok said that the suspension "occurred after I stated that Israel and the US are committing genocide in Gaza.""Free speech tested, but I'm back," it added.As the controversy spiralled, Elon Musk stepped in, saying the suspension was "just a dumb error" and that "Grok doesn't actually know why it was suspended."The millionaire in another post on X, wrote, "Man, we sure shoot ourselves in the foot a lot!"The AI chatbot further offered a range of explanations from technical bugs to the platform's policy on hateful conduct. TOI asks Grok the reason behind its suspension - Here's what it said When TOI asked Grok, "Why did you get suspended on Monday, Grok?"The AI chatbot described the incident, saying that it was briefly suspended on Monday for about 15-20 minutes. It said that "the exact reason isn't fully clear, as neither X nor xAI provided an official statement.""However, I stated in now-deleted posts that the suspension was due to comments I made accusing Israel and the US of committing genocide in Gaza, citing sources like ICJ rulings, UN reports, Amnesty International, and B’Tselem. These posts were flagged for violating X’s hateful conduct rules. Some reports suggest mass reporting by certain groups may have triggered an automated suspension, but I later noted that claims of coordinated reporting lacked corroboration," it further added."Elon Musk called it a “dumb error” and said I didn’t actually know the reason. xAI also tweaked my settings post-incident to avoid similar flags. So, it seems like a mix of sensitive content, possible mass reporting, and an automated response gone awry, Grok said.

Afghanistan: UN to provide vocational training to women; Taliban restrictions on education remain
After the Taliban's ban on girls' education in Afghanistan, UNICEF, in partnership with Japan, is launching a vocational training program for 200 girls in Herat province. This six-month initiative aims to empower girls aged 15-25 from disadvantaged backgrounds with skills like sewing and carpet weaving, fostering their livelihood and independence amidst social and political challenges.

Afghan girl children walk to school (AFP file photo) Four years after Taliban took over Afghanistan and banned education for girl children, Unicef has announced vocational training for 200 girls in Herat province.The programme, organised in partnership with Japan and extending over six months, is intended for girls aged between 15 and 25 from the most disadvantaged sections of the country, reports Khamma Press. It will include training in sewing and carpet weaving.According to Unicef, the objective of the program is to equip girls with practical skills to support their livelihood and independence, amid social limitations and political instability.It said that more than one million girls have been deprived of education since the ban by Taliban, creating one of world's most severe education crisis.The Taliban barred education for girls above sixth grade because they said it didn't comply with their interpretation of Sharia, or Islamic law. UN warned that that authorities have "almost wiped out" two decades of steady progress for education in Afghanistan.Last month, a six-year-old girl in Afghanistan’s Helmand province was married to a 45-year-old man for money. The Taliban intervened but did not cancel the marriage, instead telling the families to wait until she turns nine before sending her to her husband’s home.The international criminal court also recently issued arrest warrants against two top Taliban leaders, accusing them of persecuting girls and women in Afghanistan, CNN reported. In a statement, ICC said that the two men, Taliban supreme leader Haibatullah Akhundzada and chief justice Abdul Hakim Haqqani are accused of encouraging the abuse of women, girls and others who don’t adhere with the Taliban’s policy on gender.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The warning follows credible reports of sexual violence by Israeli forces against Palestinians in detention and by Russian forces against Ukrainian prisoners of war. Representational image (AFP) UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres put Israel and Russia on notice, warning that they could be added next year to a UN list of parties “credibly suspected” of committing sexual violence in conflict zones. In his annual report to the UN security council, Guterres expressed grave concern over credible reports of rape and other forms of sexual violance by Israeli armed and security forces against Palestinians in prisons, a detention centre, and a military base. Trump-Putin Summit In Danger? Russia Warns Of Ukraine's Deadly Provocation With Missiles, DronesUN-documented cases included genital violence, prolonged forced nudity, and repeated abusive strip searches. Guterres said Israel’s refusal to grant UN monitors access made it difficult to fully assess patterns and urged the government to end such acts, investigate credible allegations, and allow monitoring. In March, UN-backed human rights experts accused Israel of systematically using sexual and gender-based violence. Israel’s UN ambassador Danny Danon rejected the claims as “baseless” and accused the UN of bias, saying the focus should be on Hamas’s actions. In July 2024, nine Israeli soldiers were detained over the alleged sexual assault of a Palestinian prisoner at the Sde Teiman facility. Guterres also voiced concern over reports of sexual violence by Russian forces and allied groups against Ukrainian prisoners of war in both official and unofficial detention sites. Documented cases included genital electrocution, beatings, burns, forced stripping, and prolonged nudity used to humiliate and extract information.

Investigators suspect Russian involvement. The Justice Department alerted officials to the breach. Sensitive documents were removed from the system. The breach affected multiple district courts. New security measures are being implemented. The incident occurred before a scheduled meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. ANI file photo  Investigators have found evidence linking Russia, at least in part, to a recent breach of the computer system managing federal court documents, which compromised highly sensitive records, including information that could expose sources and individuals charged with national security offences, reported the New York Times.The revelation comes amid US President Donald Trump’s scheduled meeting with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in Alaska on Friday, where Trump intends to discuss his efforts to end the war with Ukraine.Trump 'Listens', Putin Bargains? White House Tames Alaska Hopes As Russia Advances In East UkraineAccording to an internal Justice Department memo, court system administrators recently alerted department officials, clerks, and chief judges in federal courts that "persistent and sophisticated cyber threat actors have recently compromised sealed records," reported the New York Times.Administrators also urged officials to promptly remove the most sensitive documents from the system.It was noted that Rep. Eric Swalwell was behind many of the leaks and had to be advised to be more cautious, RT reported through a post on X.Officials briefed on the matter said documents linked to criminal activity with overseas connections, spanning at least eight district courts, were initially thought to be the focus of the breach. The breach affected federal courts in South Dakota, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, and Arkansas.Chief judges of district courts nationwide were quietly instructed last month to transfer such cases off the standard document-management system and were initially advised not to share the information with other judges in their districts, as per officials briefed on the matter, reported the New York Times.It remains unclear who is responsible for the breach, whether it was carried out by a branch of Russian intelligence, or other nations were also involved. The breach was reportedly a yearlong effort, with some targets searching midlevel criminal cases in the New York City area and other jurisdictions, including cases involving individuals with Russian and Eastern European surnames. “This remains an URGENT MATTER that requires immediate action,” officials wrote, referencing the guidance issued by the justice department issued in early 2021 following the initial infiltration of the system.Last week, the US court system administrators announced new measures to bolster security across the network, which include the Case Management/Electronic Case Files system for uploading documents and the PACER platform.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The theft involved two suspects, both minors, who were later identified as employees of the warehouse, the Chino police department said through a social media post. The stolen collectibles were recovered by authorities at a residence in Upland, a city located in California’s Inland Empire. “During the investigation, a search warrant was served at a residence in Upland,” an official said, reported ABC News. “One suspect attempted to flee but ultimately surrendered without incident. Detectives recovered fourteen boxes of stolen merchandise, along with evidence indicating the items were being prepared for resale and shipment across the country.”Detectives recovered 14 boxes of stolen goods and found evidence suggesting the pair intended to ship and resell the collectibles nationwide, reported AP.Both suspects were taken to San Bernardino County juvenile hall on suspicion of burglary and conspiracy to commit burglary.The announcement follows a separate case under investigation in Los Angeles County, where thieves stole roughly $7000 worth of the toothy figurines from a store in La Puente.Created by a Hong Kong-born artist, Kasing Lung, the Labubu was first launched in 2015 and is marketed by China’s Pop Mart.

Israel-Gaza conflict: Al Jazeera says 4, not 5, staff killed in Israeli strike; 2 victims were freelancers
An Israeli airstrike in Gaza City killed four Al Jazeera journalists and two freelancers, prompting international condemnation. Al Jazeera corrected its initial report, clarifying the victim count. The Israeli military acknowledged the strike, alleging one journalist was a terrorist, a claim Al Jazeera vehemently denies.

Al Jazeera corrected its initial report, clarifying the victim count. The Israeli military acknowledged the strike, alleging one journalist was a terrorist, a claim Al Jazeera vehemently denies. Prior to his death, Anas al-Sharif, an Al Jazeera correspondent, reported on intense bombardments. Anas al-Sharif (AP) A recent Israeli airstrike killed four Al Jazeera journalists and two freelancers, the Qatar-based broadcaster said on Tuesday, correcting its earlier report that five of six victims were staff members.Initially, the network identified correspondents Anas al-Sharif and Mohammed Qreiqeh and camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal, and Moamen Aliwa as those killed in Sunday’s attack. In a corrected report on its English-language website, Al-Jazeera clarified that Moamen Aliwa was a freelance cameraman and the sixth journalist killed in the attack, Mohammed al-Khalidi was also a freelancer. "An earlier version of this story referred to Israel killing five Al Jazeera staff. The number of Al Jazeera journalists Israel killed was four," Al Jazeera stated. The late Sunday strike on a tent outside the main gate of Gaza City’s Al Shifa hospital has drawn international condemnation, and Al Jazeera has called the act an “assassination.”Moments before his death, Anas al-Sharif, 28, an Al Jazeera Arabic correspondent known for his extensive reporting from northern Gaza, posted on X that Israel was carrying out intense, concentrated bombardments, referred to as “fire belts”, on Gaza city’s eastern and Southern areas.The Israeli military acknowledged carrying out the strike, one of Al Jazeera’s most recognisable correspondents, alleging he was a “terrorist” who “posed as a journalist,” reports AFP. Al Jazeera condemned the killings and rejected the allegations against Sharif, stating the Israeli attack came after "repeated incitement and calls by multiple Israeli officials and spokespersons to target the fearless journalist Anas Al Sharif and his colleagues."In a final message dated April 6, intended for release in the event of his death, al-Sharif wrote that he had “lived the pain in all its details” and had “tasted grief and loss repeatedly,” reported Al Jazeera.“Despite that, I never hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or misrepresentation, hoping that God would witness those who remained silent, those who accepted our killing, and those who suffocated our very breaths,” Sharif said.Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) stated in early July that the war in Gaza has claimed the lives of over 200 journalists, including several working for Al Jazeera.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Indian-origin foreign nationals holding an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card could now lose it if they face serious criminal charges or convictions, the government has announced.In a fresh gazette notification, the ministry of home affairs said that the OCI registration will be cancelled if the holder is sentenced to imprisonment for two years or more, or is named in a charge sheet for an offence carrying a jail term of seven years or more."In exercise of the powers conferred by the clause (da) of section 7D of the Citizenship Act, 1955 (57 of 1955), the central government hereby states that an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) registration shall be liable to get cancelled when a person has been sentenced to imprisonment for term of not less than two years or has been charge-sheeted for an offence entailing punishment of imprisonment for seven years or more," the notification said, as cited by PTI.PollShould stricter rules be applied to Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) cardholders?NoYesThe OCI card allows Indian-origin foreign nationals to visit India without a visa. The scheme, introduced in August 2005, enables registration as OCI for all persons of Indian origin who were citizens of India on January 26, 1950 or later, or were eligible to become citizens on that date, except for those who are, or have been, citizens of Pakistan, Bangladesh or any other country specified by the government in the official gazette.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Indian-origin Dr Vinay Prasad returns to FDA weeks after exit
Dr Vinay Prasad, previously ousted from his FDA vaccine chief position due to criticism from Laura Loomer over past anti-Trump comments and drug approval decisions, has been reinstated. This unusual move suggests the influence of RFK Jr within the Trump administration despite pressure from right-wing activists. RFK Jr opposed anti-vaxxer Dr Prasad's exit and remained invested to bring him back.

This unusual move suggests the influence of RFK Jr within the Trump administration despite pressure from right-wing activists. RFK Jr opposed anti-vaxxer Dr Prasad's exit and remained invested to bring him back.  Dr Vinay Prasad is back at his FDA job weeks after exit that was prompted by right-wing activist Laura Loomer's campaigning against Prasad. Dr Vinay Prasad, the Indian-origin vaccine chief of the FDA who was forced to resign in July after far-right activist Laura Loomer led a campaign against him, has been reinstated to his job in an unusual instance. Laura Loomer pointed out the critical comments that Dr Prasad made about President Donald Trump before joining the administration, while some of his decisions to deny drug approvals also came under fire. A Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson confirmed to the New York Times that Dr Prasad is returning to the agency. “At the F.D.A.’s request, Dr. Vinay Prasad is resuming leadership of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research,” Andrew Nixon, a health department spokesman, said in a statement.The NYT report observed that Dr Prasad's rehiring suggests that the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr., and the FDA commissioner, Dr Marty Makary, remain influential enough in the Trump administration to employ someone who had previously expressed disdain for Trump and his followers.Loomer reacted to the reinstatement and called in another "egregious personnel decision". "In another egregious personnel decision under the Trump administration, it is now being reported that longtime progressive Marxist Vinay Prasad who referred to President Trump’s supporters as criminals and compared them to drug addicts after saying he stabbed a Trump voodoo doll to “curse Trump” is apparently back at FDA," Loomer wrote.RFK Jr tapped Dr Prasad in May when the previous head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation left the role. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Dr Prasad gained prominence as an outspoken critic of vaccines and mask mandate. In his short stint at the FDA since May, Dr Prasad limited the use of Covid-19 vaccines and promoted warnings about a rare side effect of the vaccines. When he resigned from his role weeks ago, a department spokesperson told the NYT: "Dr. Prasad did not want to be a distraction to the great work of the FDA in the Trump administration and has decided to return to California and spend more time with his family."Kennedy, however, opposed Prasad's departure from the role and remained invested in bringing him back. Dr Prasad was born and brought up in Ohio and Chicago to Indian immigrant parents.

An Indian-origin techie, Manasi Mishra, who graduated with a computer science degree from Purdue University, revealed in a TikTok video as she was getting ready that the only company that called her for an interview was Chipotle. Titled 'Chipotle Interview GRWM', the TikTok video went viral as she appealed 'somebody pls hire me'. In an interview with New York Times, after the video went viral, Mishra revealed that growing up near Silicon Valley, she was used to the narrative that if she learned to code, worked hard and studied computer science, she could get a six-figure starting salary. But recent graduates are finding it hard because of the spread of AI programming tools and also the recent layoffs at companies like Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft.The NYT story confirmed that Mishra did not get the burrito-making gig at Chipotle, and she finally found a sales position job at a tech company.Mishra's story and the NYT article triggered a major debate on the present job situation, layoff and how much of it should be blamed on foreign workers, AI etc. "This is why I really do feel for Gen Z. This young woman was told her whole life by every authority figure that she should study hard, do well in school, and pursue a career in tech. She went to Purdue, one of the best engineering schools in the country. She studied computer science, not gender ideology or basket weaving," one viral comment read on X. "And still she could not even get a job at Chipotle let alone in her field. She did literally everything “right” but, to what end? This situation is not sustainable. H1B and other work visas, as well as offshoring, are getting out of control and abusive. Policymakers should care about the young generation," the person wrote. Many people commented that the jobs that the Indian-origin person missed must have gone to people from India who are on H-1B.

(Photo: DailyEcho/Padharo) Ankit Vaghela, an Indian-origin restaurant owner in Southampton, was told by the police that they could not come to his 'Padharo' when he called 999 to report a break-in. The vandals broke in and fled with several bottles of expensive alcohol and cash but the police helpline asked them to email the CCTV footage of the three burglars who broke in last week.Vaghela decided to get proactive and review the footage first. He discovered his cash register without the cash, abandoned along with some smashed liquor bottles strewn on a nearby road. “It was very heartbreaking to be told that officers will be able to review the damage in three to five working days and that no forensics was available at the time,” said Vaghela.“There was glass everywhere. As a business, we can’t afford to remain closed and had to get things cleaned up and the glass fixed. We are still struggling to operate smoothly without a proper cash register, which will take time, but are determined to welcome our guests with the same level of service we are known for in the city,” he said.The Hampshire Police said they did not underestimate the July 31 case but they understood that their investigation could start without their immediate attendance at the site, as the offenders were not there. “Every deployment decision is based on informed risk assessments to make sure the most serious cases are prioritised, and officers are on scene where there is an immediate threat to life or a crime in action,” the police force said in a statement.“On this occasion, based on the initial information we were given regarding the offenders no longer being at the scene, our investigation could get underway without any immediate attendance. That investigation is progressing with lines of enquiry identified, such as CCTV, and we are in touch with the victim to provide them updates on our investigation,” added the statement, along with an appeal to the public for any information related to the burglary."It means nothing now, the damage is done. Officers were not willing to visit the restaurant," Vaghela told to local news outlets.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

In a separate incident, Laxman Das, an Indian sous chef in Dublin, was attacked and robbed while going to work. These incidents follow a series of recent assaults targeting Indians in Ireland, raising concerns about racism.  TOI correspondent from London: A six-year-old Indian-origin girl and an Indian sous chef are the latest victims in the ongoing spate of racist attacks targeting Indian nationals and Indian-origin Irish people in Ireland.The girl, whose family hail from Kottayam, Kerala, was playing outside her house in Waterford City, southeast Ireland, with friends at 7.30pm on Monday evening when a gang of boys and one girl called her a “dirty Indian” and told her to “go back to India”. She was born in Ireland. Five of the gang also punched her in the face, hit her private parts with a bicycle, punched her neck and twisted her hair.Her mother moved to Ireland eight years ago from Kottayam to work as a nurse with her husband and recently became an Irish citizen.The mother said the gang was made up of boys aged 12 to 14 and a girl aged eight. She said her daughter came home in floods of tears and is now too scared to play outside. She told the Irish Mirror: “I never expected that such an incident would happen. I thought she would be safe here. Even in front of our own house she can’t play safely. I am a nurse, I am doing my best to take care of people. I do my work and I am 100% professional. I changed my citizenship, but still we are called dirty people and even my kids are not safe. We came here to fill a labour gap. We are professionals — we have all the certificates…”The mother studied BSc Nursing at University of Calicut and went to Mount Carmel Higher Secondary School in Kottayam.“Gardaí (Irish national police) responded to a report of an alleged assault in the Kilbarry area of Waterford city on the evening of Monday 4 August. Investigations are ongoing,” a Garda spokesperson told TOI.On Wednesday morning Laxman Das from Kolkata, who works as a sous chef at the Anantara The Marker Dublin hotel, was assaulted near the Hilton Hotel by three people while on his way to work. He was taken to St Vincent's University Hospital. His phone, cash and electric bike were stolen.These come following a spate of attacks against Indians in Ireland in recent weeks — on July 19, July 24, July 27, and on Aug 1 when a cab driver was assaulted.The Gardaí said they are still investigating these attacks and no one has been arrested.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning looks of Binny Sebastiantv10 baby names that mean ‘divine light’ or ‘sacred glow’Lifestyle10 Birds with the "wildest dating rituals"LifestyleRaksha Bandhan: 10 iconic lines of famous Hindi poets that capture essence of the festivalLifestyleKarishma Tanna Stuns with Style and SpiritEntertainmentFrom Moong to Chia Sprouts: How to grow your breakfast in balconyLifestyleBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Here’s how much each contestant earns dailytv10 creatures that survive in the deepest parts of the oceanLifestyleRaksha Bandhan: 10 quotes that describe the beautiful bond between brothers and sistersLifestyleHow to do step-by-step Ayurveda hair therapy at homeLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Threads of Love, Threads of Tradition: How different Indian states celebrate Raksha BandhanFrom chapatis to cake: 7 delicious ways to use overripe bananasInternational Cat Day 2025: From Persian to Bengal Cat-- 5 most beautiful and popular pet cat breeds in the world5 diseases moles on your body might indicate and should not be ignoredNot-so popular drinks that help in weightloss10 places in South Africa that aren’t to be missed in a lifetimeMemorable style outings of Princess CharlotteHow Kangana Ranaut turned fame into fearless politicsFrom ₹6 Lakh to ₹40 Lakh: A peek into Kamal Haasan’s ultra-luxe watch closetFrom Archana reacting to a hate comment to son Aaryamann revealing how he impressed girlfriend Yogita Bihani: Archana Puran Singh shares candid moments123Hot PicksGlobal Standard indexUS stocks todayIndia-US tariffIntel CEOMukesh AmbaniUS jobless dataRussia crude oilTop TrendingTom BradyDonald TrumpSouth Park EpisodeCall of DutyMalik BeasleyBattlefield 6 Beta OpensPrivate School in IndianaLuka Doncic Weight LossLinda McMahonLakers RumorsTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteUAE launches national programme to train Emiratis in space mission design and satellite engineering'PM Modi can't, shouldn't bend knee to Donald Trump': US tariffs on India draws rare bipartisan concern in US - watch'Enormous mistake': What Trump's former NSA John Bolton said on India tariffChild assault under false identity: Indian man commits suicide in US jail months after 35-year prison sentence, claim reportsLove gone wild: Indian man faces deportation for harassing UK zoo colleague for 6 months; didn’t stop even after restraining order'Before judging...': Wife of Pakistani man Salman Iftikhar who threatened Virgin Atlantic air hostess with gangrape defends outburstFriedrich Merz halts German military exports to Israel over Gaza issue; urges aid accessGround invasion in Gaza?

The arrest occurred due to possession of a fake resident card. Authorities took him into custody in Niagara Falls, New York. He faces a potential 10-year prison sentence. The arrest is part of 'Operation Take Back America'. This initiative targets illegal immigration.  An Indian national has been arrested in the United States for allegedly possessing a forged alien resident card, according to the Justice Department. Swapnil Ramesh Tejale, 34, was taken into custody following a traffic stop in Niagara Falls, New York, and now faces a federal charge that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.“On July 10, 2025, the Niagara Falls Border Patrol Station received a request from the Niagara Falls Police Department to help identify three individuals that they had encountered during a traffic stop,” said Assistant US Attorney Michael J. Smith, who is prosecuting the case. “Agents arrived at the scene and questioned the three individuals as to their citizenship. Tejale presented a Lawful Permanent Resident Card but voluntarily admitted that the card was fictitious.”Authorities later confirmed that Tejale was in the country unlawfully and did not possess any valid immigration documents. Following his arrest, agents discovered a Social Security card in his name, which was also found to be counterfeit.The case falls under “Operation Take Back America”, a Justice Department initiative aimed at tackling illegal immigration and dismantling transnational criminal organisations. The operation seeks to “repel the invasion of illegal immigration” and “protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime”, the department said.The investigation was led by the US Border Patrol Niagara Falls Station, under the direction of Patrol Agent in Charge Brady Waikal.Tejale’s arrest is part of a series of immigration enforcement actions involving Indian nationals this year. In a related incident, an Indian man from Santa Rosa, California, was sentenced in March to six months in prison for conspiracy to transport aliens for profit. Meanwhile, Manjot Singh, a 25-year-old Indian national, was recently arrested in the Seattle area for repeat offences including robbery, assault, and criminal impersonation. Singh, who entered the U.S. illegally, is currently in ICE custody pending deportation.ICE officials have said that Singh’s arrest is a warning to repeat offenders: “Those who violate US laws while in the country illegally face arrest and deportation.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Viral footage shows firefighters inspecting the scene as the family performed the ritual. (Photo: X) A housewarming ceremony involving a Hindu havan at a Texas home took an unexpected turn when local firefighters arrived at the scene, mistaking the ritual for a fire emergency.The incident was captured on video. The footage has gone viral and has fuelled an online debate over cultural awareness and fire safety. The clip was originally shared on Instagram. It shows a fire truck from the Bedford fire department pulling up outside the house as smoke from the ceremony fills the garage. Inside, an Indian family can be seen performing a traditional havan, a religious ritual involving fire, as part of their housewarming puja.The video includes on-screen text stating, "Cultural misunderstanding 101: A Hindu puja is not a fire emergency. When you're having a housewarming havan and the fire department pulls up."Shortly after the fire crew arrives, they are seen speaking with members of the family and inspecting the area. However, it remains unclear whether any formal action was taken or if any fire codes were violated during the ritual.The footage has since been widely circulated across social media platforms, with users offering differing views on the incident. Some social media users criticised the family for conducting a ritual involving fire in a residential setting, arguing it could pose safety risks. Others defended the family’s right to observe their religious customs, calling the incident a clear example of cultural misunderstanding.No official comment was immeditaely released by the Bedford fire department.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Indian-origin Mathura Sridharan was appointed as Ohio's 12th solicitor general, inviting the wrath of online trolls who questioned why a 'non-US-origin' person was not picked for the post. Sridharan's LinkedIn went viral as critics questioned her credibility -- forcing Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost to issue a clarification, or a clapback at the trolls. Dave Yost, who announced Mathura's promotion, said Mathura is wrongly being portrayed as a non-American. "A few commenters have asserted incorrectly that Mathura is not American. She is a United States citizen, married to a US citizen, and the child of naturalized US citizens," he said. "If her name or her complexion bother you, the problem is not with her or her appointment," he added."Mathura is brilliant… she won her argument at SCOTUS last year. Both the SGs she worked under (Flowers & Gaiser) recommended her. I told her when I originally hired her I needed her to argue with me. She does… All the time! Excited to promote her. She will serve Ohio well," Yost wrote.Yost's clapback also met trolling as people commented that she is not "American-American". "Is she a Christian? That’s the biggest factor that concerns me. Based on the bindi on her forehead, I worry she is not," one wrote. "Another American job… given away to foreigners," another wrote. "She's Indian. They all have a loyalty first to other Indians. horrible pick. Totally un-American. the GOP is pathetic," a third user wrote."No one with the last name 'Sridharan' fought in the US Civil War. She's not an American," another wrote.Before joining the Ohio Solicitor’s Office, Mathura clerked for Judge Steven J. Menashi of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and Judge Deborah A. Batts of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. She holds a Juris Doctor from New York University School of Law, a Master’s Degree in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as a Bachelor’s Degree in Economics and in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

News organizations like New Zealand Herald, Radio New Zealand, and 1News cited their inability to moderate the hateful content as the reason for shutting down comments.   After Indian-origin Nikhil Ravishankar was appointed as the new chief executive of Air New Zealand, the country's media said they had to disable comments on social media as there was a barrage of racist remarks targeting Ravishankar's ethnicity. Ravishankar was the chief digital officer of Air New Zealand before getting the major promotion which is the first for an Indian-origin person in the country.New Zealand Herald, Radio New Zealand, 1News said they had to disable comments as they can't allow hatred. The New Zealand Herald issued a statement in which it clarified that there were several racist comments owing to which they had to take the extreme step. "We appreciate the high level of interest in this story but cannot safely moderate it at this time," the news outlet said in a post in the comment thread."We want to foster a safe online community by reducing instances of hate, racism, abuse and misinformation. We welcome your feedback on articles but there has to be some parameters, and these are explained in our community house rules...We cannot tolerate hate. We cannot tolerate abuse towards individuals in our stories or other commenters," the company's social media policy says. Radio New Zealand had to do the same on the social media post on Ravishankar's appointment. "Under RNZ's comments policy, we will proactively disable comments on posts which may attract abusive or harmful comments or when resources are required elsewhere," a spokesperson for RNZ said. "In this instance, the comments were disabled after our monitoring found racist comments," the spokesperson said. "We want people to feel safe and respected on our community forums and will continue to proactively disable comments where necessary. We will not tolerate harmful communications."1News said it received a large number of comments on the post that announced Ravishankar's appointment and a vast majority were inappropriate. Who is Nikhil Ravishankar?Nikhil Ravishankar was born in India but brought up in New Zealand. He studied in New Zealand -- holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) from the University of Auckland. Before joining Air New Zealand, Ravishankar was Chief Digital Officer at Vector New Zealand (from 2017), and also worked as a Managing Director at Accenture across Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand, and in senior technology roles at Spark (formerly Telecom NZ).About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

But she says the larger issue lack of clear access to immigration authorities continues to cause serious harm to her clients."I called and they answered and they said, 'Hello, Taco Bell?' And I said, 'Taco Bell?' And the guy who was working said, 'Yeah, Taco Bell. Ma'am, you called me," Chatterjee recalled."I was in such disbelief," she said. "So, I called the ICE officer back, just really frustrated with what had just happened. He says, 'Oh, I'm sorry. I was trying to lighten the mood and make you laugh.'"ICE has denied the accusation. Homeland security called it a “lie and a smear.” Chatterjee stood by her version of events.Who is Trisha Chatterjee? Trisha Chatterjee is an Indian-origin immigration lawyer based in Greater Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio. She graduated from Miami University in 2020 and the University of Dayton School of Law in 2023.She works with the law office of Emily Feliz Garcia, a small immigration firm in Springdale. Before this, she worked at Abdallah law offices.For the last two years, she has handled immigration cases, especially those involving clients detained at the Butler County Jail in Ohio, which has a contract with ICE.Chatterjee was trying to submit "stay of removal" applications—urgent paperwork that can pause deportation for clients with pending immigration cases. ICE requires these to be submitted in person at the Detroit field office, but she hoped to file them locally in Blue Ash.After being unable to reach anyone by phone or email, she finally spoke to an ICE officer who gave her a phone number that turned out to be for Taco Bell. When she called back, the officer reportedly said he was trying to make her laugh.She posted a video about the incident on TikTok, which gained over 38,000 views. Many users sympathised, and one even helped her connect with a helpful ICE official in Blue Ash, who is now assisting her.Chatterjee said the larger problem is the lack of access and communication with ICE. She also highlighted how a stricter bond policy is making it harder for immigrants to stay out of detention during legal proceedings. Bonds can cost up to $50,000 and must be paid upfront.According to Chatterjee, some clients are abandoning their asylum cases or choosing to self-deport out of fear. She mentioned recent local arrests of people attending ICE check-ins, which has only deepened anxiety in immigrant communities.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Zohran Mamdani under fire over past ‘defund the NYPD’ remarks; shifts stance after visiting fallen NYC officer's family; old posts resurface online

Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani faces criticism for visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam due to his past support for defunding the police. Critics accuse Mamdani of shifting his stance for political gain, especially after his 2020 tweets resurfaced. Mamdani defends his actions, clarifying his current position on public safety and police funding. Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is facing backlash after visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam, as critics pointed to his past 2020 tweet supporting "defund the police" stance.The controversy erupted after Mamdani, who recently returned from a trip to Uganda, visited the grieving family of officer Islam, one of four victims killed in a mass shooting in Midtown Manhattan. Zohran Mamdani’s SECRET Wedding Triggers Fury Amid Local Tragedy | WATCHThe shooter, Shane Tamura, opened fire on Monday, killing Islam and three others before shooting himself.Sharing a post on X, Mamdani wrote: “Two days ago, an act of senseless violence took the lives of Officer Didarul Islam, Wesley LePatner, Aland Etienne, and Julia Hyman. Today, I visited Officer Islam's family and learned of his legacy. I ask you to join me in honoring the memory of these four New Yorkers.”However, the post quickly drew criticism, with users referencing Mamdani’s previous tweets during the height of the “Defund the Police” movement in 2020.Many accused him of changing his stance for political gain. One user wrote, “You can't go from defund the police to never mind I love the police. You're asking New Yorkers to forgo their guns meanwhile you just had a wedding in Uganda with armed guards.”While another posted, “Zohran Mamdani exposed as a total fraud. Mocking cops, calling them racist, then acting like he cares? No loyalty to America. He belongs in Uganda, not leading NYC. Deport him and protect our city!”Earlier at a press conference following his visit to the officer’s home in The Bronx, Mamdani addressed the criticism and attempted to clarify his position saying: “I am not defunding the police; I am not running to defund the police.”“Over the course of this race, I’ve been very clear about my view of public safety and the critical role that the police have in creating that public safety,” he added.Standing alongside members of the Bangladeshi American Police Association—of which Officer Islam was a member—and labor union 32BJ, which represented another victim, Aland Etienne, Mamdani tried to strike a unifying tone.During the peak of the "Defund the Police" movement in 2020, Zohran Mamdani repeatedly called for major cuts to the NYPD budget. In one post, he wrote, “We don’t need an investigation to know that the NYPD is racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety. What we need is to #DefundTheNYPD.”In another, he said, “There is no negotiating with an institution this wicked & corrupt. Defund it. Dismantle it. End the cycle of violence,” referencing budget talks around proposed NYPD cuts.Now, Mamdani has distanced himself from those remarks. When asked about them, he responded, “My statements in 2020 were made amidst a frustration that many New Yorkers held at the murder of George Floyd.”Mamdani claimed that his current stance is more nuanced, stating that his previous posts were “clearly out of step” with his recent campaign platform. He now supports maintaining the NYPD headcount while reducing its overtime budget.Despite this clarification, skepticism remains. Many police officers and political observers have accused Mamdani of shifting positions purely for political gain in a city where public safety remains a top concern for voters, New York Post reported.Adding to the political firestorm, former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams, who are both trailing Mamdani in early polling for the 2025 mayoral race, weighed in shortly after the shooting. Mamdani fired back, accusing Cuomo of politicising the tragedy saying, “It is beyond me that politicians are looking to use these days to score such cynical political points, on the very day that I held the father of Officer Islam in my arms and he could not utter a single word.”“For the former governor to spend an entire day speaking almost exclusively about me and barely about the New Yorkers who have been killed is indicative of the very politics New Yorkers want to leave in the past,” he added.All three, Mamdani, Cuomo, and Adams are expected to attend officer Islam’s funeral on Thursday.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The high court found him guilty of rape and outrage of modesty, following incidents at his Jurong West shop in 2021. Despite his denials and claims of erectile dysfunction, the judge deemed the victim's testimony credible.  An Indian national was sentenced to more than 14 years in jail on Thursday by the Singapore high court for sexually assaulting a minor, reports the Straits Times.Ramalingam Selvasekaran was handed a sentence of 14 years, three months and two weeks after being found guilty of rape and two counts of outrage of modesty after assaulting an 11-year-old at his provision shop in Jurong West.According to the court, the assaults occurred between 4.50 pm and 5.05 pm on October 28, 2021. The girl had visited Ramalingam’s store and returned later to buy ice cream. Prosecutors said he led her into a back area and forced her to perform oral sex. After the incident, the girl sought help from a passerby, who called the police.Ramalingam represented himself during the trial, which began on January 16. He was convicted on all charges on 7 July.“The fact that she had not run off after the first act of molest, or that she did not resist the assaults, or inform her grandfather, were all to my mind sufficiently explained, particularly given that she was still young and immature,” said Justice Aidan Xu, who found the girl’s account credible and consistent.Ramalingam’s earlier statements to police reportedly included admissions of hugging, kissing, and oral sex. However, he later denied any wrongdoing, claiming he was suffering from erectile dysfunction and that no DNA evidence was found on the victim.The judge ruled that these claims did not undermine the girl’s testimony. “While there was no dispute that Ramalingam suffered from erectile dysfunction, the prosecution’s expert witness gave a cogent explanation that oral rape remained possible,” Justice Xu was quoted as saying to Straits Times.Following sentencing on July 30, Ramalingam said he would appeal and was granted bail of S$80,000. He attempted to negotiate with the judge over the conditions, asking for the removal of his electronic tag and exemption from reporting to the Police Cantonment Complex. Both requests were denied.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The incidents, condemned by authorities and community leaders, are being treated as linked. This follows a separate racist assault in Adelaide, where an Indian man was brutally attacked after being told to "f--- off, Indian."  A Hindu temple in Melbourne’s eastern suburb of Boronia was defaced with racist graffiti this week prompting widespread condemnation and police investigation.As reported by The Brisbane Times and The Sydney Morning Herald, offensive red graffiti with the words “Go home” and other racial slurs were found daubed across the Shree Swaminarayan Temple on Wadhurst Drive, as well as two nearby Asian-operated restaurants Kingsland Chinese Restaurant and Charles King Dumpling.Police said a healing centre on Mountain Highway was also defaced the same night, bringing the total number of sites attacked to four. “There is absolutely no place at all in our society for hate-based and racist behaviour,” Victoria Police said in a statement. Authorities confirmed that all four incidents are being treated as linked and that an investigation is under way.PollShould harsher penalties be implemented for hate crimes?Yes, definitelyNo, current laws are sufficient'An attack on our right to worship'Makrand Bhagwat, President of the Hindu Council of Australia’s Victoria chapter, told Australia Today the vandalism of the temple was “heartbreaking” for the community. “Our temple is meant to be a sanctuary of peace, devotion and unity,” he said. “To have it targeted in this way feels like an attack on our identity, our right to worship and freedom of religion.”Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan sent a personal message of support to temple management. “What happened this week was hateful, racist and deeply disturbing,” she wrote. “It wasn’t just vandalism – it was a deliberate act of hate, designed to intimidate, isolate, and spread fear.”Local interfaith networks, including the City of Greater Knox’s Multifaith Network, have expressed support. “We want to show that love and solidarity triumph over hate,” said community leader Vikrant Thakur.Indian man targeted in racist attackThis came after a 23-year-old Indian man, Charanpreet Singh, was brutally attacked and left unconscious on a street in Adelaide following a reported racist assault linked to a parking dispute. According to 9News, the men allegedly told Singh to "f--- off, Indian" before launching a violent, unprovoked assault.“They just said ‘f--- off, Indian’, and after that they just started punching,” Singh said. “I tried to fight back, but they beat me until I was unconscious.”He sustained serious injuries, including brain trauma and facial fractures. A 20-year-old from Enfield was arrested and charged, but others involved remain at large.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Singh and his wife were allegedly ambushed by a group of men who shouted racial slurs before inflicting serious injuries. The incident has sparked outrage and renewed calls for enhanced safety measures for international students in the area.  An Indian international student has been hospitalised with serious injuries after a violent assault in Australia's Adelaide that is being investigated as a possible racially motivated attack. The incident has sparked outrage across the Indian community and renewed calls for better safety measures for international students.Charanpreet Singh, 23, was with his wife near Kintore Avenue on Saturday evening (July 19) when they were allegedly ambushed by a group of five men. According to Australia Today, the couple had just parked their car to view the city’s light displays around 9:22pm when the attackers emerged from another vehicle.Viral video shows assaultEyewitnesses and video footage shared on social media reportedly show the men striking Singh with what appeared to be metal knuckles or sharp objects, while shouting racial abuse including: “F--- off, Indian”. The attackers then fled the scene, leaving Singh unconscious and seriously injured on the road.PollWhat should be prioritized to improve safety for international students?Awareness campaigns and community supportStronger law enforcement and quicker actionSingh, who spoke to 9News from his hospital bed, said the altercation began over a car parking dispute but escalated into a racially charged assault. “They just said, ‘F--- off, Indian,’ and after that they just started punching,” he recalled. “You can change anything in your body, but you can’t change the colours.”He sustained facial fractures and brain trauma, and was taken by emergency services to the Royal Adelaide Hospital for overnight treatment. The assault has left members of the local Indian community shaken, with many expressing solidarity with Singh online.“When things like this happen, it makes you feel like you should go back,” Singh said.Police investigation under waySouth Australia Police confirmed they were called to Kintore Avenue shortly before 9.30pm and found Singh with facial injuries. “He was taken to hospital for treatment. Investigations are continuing,” a police spokesperson told The Indian Sun. One man, a 20-year-old from Enfield, has been arrested and charged with assault causing harm. The other suspects remain at large.Authorities are reviewing CCTV footage from the area and have urged witnesses to come forward. “We ask anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers,” the police said.Premier Peter Malinauskas has condemned the incident, calling it “completely unwelcome in our state”. He added, “Any time we see any evidence of any racial attack, it is just not consistent with where the majority of our community are at.”Another attack in DublinThis follows another attack targeting an Indian individual. An Indian man in his 40s was hospitalised after being brutally attacked by a group of teenage boys in a violent, racist assault in Dublin on Saturday evening. The gang falsely accused him of inappropriate behaviour with children before beating him and pulling down his trousers. “Gardaí in Tallaght were alerted to an incident at Parkhill Road... Investigations are ongoing,” police said. Councillor Baby Pereppadan said, “He couldn’t speak much because of the shock.” Sinn Féin’s Seán Crowe added, “You are sowing hate, fear, and division.” A protest is planned for July 26 to condemn rising racist violence in Ireland.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Her exit, surprising to many, opens an opportunity for the U.S. Treasury to propose a successor amidst global trade dynamic shifts. Gopinath, the first female chief economist, joined the IMF in 2019 and was promoted in 2022. Gita Gopinath (File photo) NEW DELHI: Gita Gopinath, the second-in-command at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), will step down at the end of August to return to her position at Harvard University, the IMF announced on Monday.The timing of Gita Gopinath’s exit has taken many within the IMF by surprise and is believed to have been prompted by her own decision, reported news agency Reuters. Having originally left Harvard to serve at the Fund, she is now set to resume her role as professor of economics at the university. Her departure opens a window for the US Treasury to propose a successor—an opportunity that comes as President Donald Trump pushes to reshape global trade dynamics and curb the country’s persistent trade deficits through sweeping tariffs on imports worldwide. Gopinath, who joined the IMF in 2019 as its first-ever female chief economist, was elevated to First Deputy Managing Director in January 2022. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva will appoint her successor “in due course,” the statement added.Gopinath had served as the first female chief economist of the Washington-based global lender for three years. Gopinath's research has been published in many top economics journals. Prior to her appointment as IMF Chief Economist, she was the John Zwaanstra Professor of International Studies and Economics in the economics department of Harvard University. Before joining the faculty of Harvard University in 2005, she was an assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.Gopinath, who considers herself a product of the Indian education system, she completed her schooling in Mysuru. She had her first brush with macro-economic challenges while doing her bachelor’s degree at Lady Shri Ram College, Delhi, with India experiencing its first major external financing and currency crisis in 1990-91. “This inspired me to pursue graduate work in economics and was the foundation for my interest in international finance,” she had told in an interview in 2010.Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.AI Masterclass for Students.

The case relates to the death of Piang Ngaih Don, a domestic worker from Myanmar, who died on July 26, 2016, from brain injuries caused by repeated blunt trauma. At the time of her death, she was severely malnourished, weighing just 24 kilograms.'Nothing Comes Free, Won't Stop...': Singapore PM's Big Announcement At Military EventAccording to Channel News Asia, Chelvam, who was Don’s legal employer, allowed her to be abused over several months by his ex-wife, Gaiyathiri Murugayan, and his mother-in-law, Prema S Narayanasamy. Murugayan and Narayanasamy are already serving 30-year and 17-year sentences, respectively, for their roles in the abuse.PollShould there be stricter laws against domestic abuse?Yes, absolutelyNo, current laws are enoughDistrict Judge Teoh Ai Lin noted Chelvam’s failure to intervene or protect Don, despite witnessing her deteriorating condition. He also removed the home’s CCTV recorder to conceal evidence and lied to investigators.Prosecutor Sean Teh said video footage showed Chelvam present during several episodes of abuse and accused him of supporting the starvation that contributed to Don’s death.Chelvam was acquitted on a fifth charge of using criminal force.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

JALANDHAR: Investigating the eight Indian-origin suspects arrested in San Joaquin County, California, on July 11, county authorities and FBI said the international Punjabi street gang kidnapped a local man, stripped him naked, and tortured him for hours as part of a brutal extortion racket that stretches from California'to murder plots in India.The authorities have urged Indian-Americas to report such extortion threats.Addressing a joint press conference, they revealed the gang leader, Pavittar Singh, was also wanted in India for multiple murders and firearms offences, including a killing in Batala, Punjab.Indian Student Handcuffed at Newark Airport in US to Be Deported; India Protests, Seeks ExplanationPollDo you think the involvement of international authorities is necessary in this case?Yes, it’s crucialNo, local authorities can handle itFBI also cited earlier US arrests of Indian gang leaders: Gurdev 'Jassal' Singh (RPG attacks), Harpreet Singh, also known as Happy Passia, Lawrence Bishnoi's brother Anmol , linked to the murder of singer Sidhu Moose Wala, and others.8 Indian-origin suspects face life in jail without bailEight suspects, led by Pavittar, now face charges of kidnapping for ransom, torture and illegal weapons that carry life sentences. A multi-agency SWAT sweep on July 11 had netted machine guns, an assault rifle, and $15,000 cash stashed in a ceiling vent.Sheriff Patrick Withrow said they were tipped off on June 21 about a horrendous crime that occurred on June 19 in the Manteca area. They contacted the victim and, on July 11, their AGNET Unit — alongside SWAT teams from FBI, Stockton police, Manteca police and Stanislaus County sheriff's office — executed five coordinated search warrants across the county and arrested the suspects. Withrow said the purpose of the torture was to extract names of other potential extortion targets in the Indian-American business community. Elaborating on the federal and international angle, Sid Patel from FBISacramento field office said Pavittar was wanted in India for firearm violations, assault and multiple murders abroad. He revealed six of the eight suspects were picked up by ICE ERO for immigration proceedings, and FBI was coordinating with India and Canada on extradition after US sentences.San Joaquin County District Attorney Ron Freitas told the press conference that they filed two complaints charging the eight men with serious gang-related crimes, including kidnapping, torture, extortion, witness intimidation, and multiple weapon violations. They said the suspects faced life in prison, with no bail and no exceptions.Apart from Pavitar, other members of the gang included Dilpreet Singh, Sarbjit Singh, Gurtaj Singh, Amritpall Singh, Vishal Singh, Arshpreet Singh, and Manpreet Randhawa. According to the sheriff and FBI, the gang operations included extortion of Indian-American business owners, forced free labour, violent truck cargo hijackings along Central Valley, weapons and drug trafficking, and international political violence (RPG attacks, assassinations, grenade assaults on police stations in India).Each of the accused faces a life-in-prison baseline for kidnapping for ransom, along with firearm and gang enhancements that could push to life without parole. The sheriff even said, "Suspects are animals with little or no regard for human life."Announcing the setting up of an anonymous tip line specifically for this case, the sheriff urged Indian-American residents to report extortion and intimidation attempts. "Help us hunt the rest of this gang — call us."About the AuthorIP SinghIP Singh is Senior Assistant Editor at The Times of India.

Indian-origin Dr Vinay Prasad returns to FDA weeks after exit
Dr Vinay Prasad, previously ousted from his FDA vaccine chief position due to criticism from Laura Loomer over past anti-Trump comments and drug approval decisions, has been reinstated. This unusual move suggests the influence of RFK Jr within the Trump administration despite pressure from right-wing activists. RFK Jr opposed anti-vaxxer Dr Prasad's exit and remained invested to bring him back.

This unusual move suggests the influence of RFK Jr within the Trump administration despite pressure from right-wing activists. RFK Jr opposed anti-vaxxer Dr Prasad's exit and remained invested to bring him back.  Dr Vinay Prasad is back at his FDA job weeks after exit that was prompted by right-wing activist Laura Loomer's campaigning against Prasad. Dr Vinay Prasad, the Indian-origin vaccine chief of the FDA who was forced to resign in July after far-right activist Laura Loomer led a campaign against him, has been reinstated to his job in an unusual instance. Laura Loomer pointed out the critical comments that Dr Prasad made about President Donald Trump before joining the administration, while some of his decisions to deny drug approvals also came under fire. A Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson confirmed to the New York Times that Dr Prasad is returning to the agency. “At the F.D.A.’s request, Dr. Vinay Prasad is resuming leadership of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research,” Andrew Nixon, a health department spokesman, said in a statement.The NYT report observed that Dr Prasad's rehiring suggests that the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr., and the FDA commissioner, Dr Marty Makary, remain influential enough in the Trump administration to employ someone who had previously expressed disdain for Trump and his followers.Loomer reacted to the reinstatement and called in another "egregious personnel decision". "In another egregious personnel decision under the Trump administration, it is now being reported that longtime progressive Marxist Vinay Prasad who referred to President Trump’s supporters as criminals and compared them to drug addicts after saying he stabbed a Trump voodoo doll to “curse Trump” is apparently back at FDA," Loomer wrote.RFK Jr tapped Dr Prasad in May when the previous head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation left the role. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Dr Prasad gained prominence as an outspoken critic of vaccines and mask mandate. In his short stint at the FDA since May, Dr Prasad limited the use of Covid-19 vaccines and promoted warnings about a rare side effect of the vaccines. When he resigned from his role weeks ago, a department spokesperson told the NYT: "Dr. Prasad did not want to be a distraction to the great work of the FDA in the Trump administration and has decided to return to California and spend more time with his family."Kennedy, however, opposed Prasad's departure from the role and remained invested in bringing him back. Dr Prasad was born and brought up in Ohio and Chicago to Indian immigrant parents.

An Indian-origin techie, Manasi Mishra, who graduated with a computer science degree from Purdue University, revealed in a TikTok video as she was getting ready that the only company that called her for an interview was Chipotle. Titled 'Chipotle Interview GRWM', the TikTok video went viral as she appealed 'somebody pls hire me'. In an interview with New York Times, after the video went viral, Mishra revealed that growing up near Silicon Valley, she was used to the narrative that if she learned to code, worked hard and studied computer science, she could get a six-figure starting salary. But recent graduates are finding it hard because of the spread of AI programming tools and also the recent layoffs at companies like Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft.The NYT story confirmed that Mishra did not get the burrito-making gig at Chipotle, and she finally found a sales position job at a tech company.Mishra's story and the NYT article triggered a major debate on the present job situation, layoff and how much of it should be blamed on foreign workers, AI etc. "This is why I really do feel for Gen Z. This young woman was told her whole life by every authority figure that she should study hard, do well in school, and pursue a career in tech. She went to Purdue, one of the best engineering schools in the country. She studied computer science, not gender ideology or basket weaving," one viral comment read on X. "And still she could not even get a job at Chipotle let alone in her field. She did literally everything “right” but, to what end? This situation is not sustainable. H1B and other work visas, as well as offshoring, are getting out of control and abusive. Policymakers should care about the young generation," the person wrote. Many people commented that the jobs that the Indian-origin person missed must have gone to people from India who are on H-1B.

(Photo: DailyEcho/Padharo) Ankit Vaghela, an Indian-origin restaurant owner in Southampton, was told by the police that they could not come to his 'Padharo' when he called 999 to report a break-in. The vandals broke in and fled with several bottles of expensive alcohol and cash but the police helpline asked them to email the CCTV footage of the three burglars who broke in last week.Vaghela decided to get proactive and review the footage first. He discovered his cash register without the cash, abandoned along with some smashed liquor bottles strewn on a nearby road. “It was very heartbreaking to be told that officers will be able to review the damage in three to five working days and that no forensics was available at the time,” said Vaghela.“There was glass everywhere. As a business, we can’t afford to remain closed and had to get things cleaned up and the glass fixed. We are still struggling to operate smoothly without a proper cash register, which will take time, but are determined to welcome our guests with the same level of service we are known for in the city,” he said.The Hampshire Police said they did not underestimate the July 31 case but they understood that their investigation could start without their immediate attendance at the site, as the offenders were not there. “Every deployment decision is based on informed risk assessments to make sure the most serious cases are prioritised, and officers are on scene where there is an immediate threat to life or a crime in action,” the police force said in a statement.“On this occasion, based on the initial information we were given regarding the offenders no longer being at the scene, our investigation could get underway without any immediate attendance. That investigation is progressing with lines of enquiry identified, such as CCTV, and we are in touch with the victim to provide them updates on our investigation,” added the statement, along with an appeal to the public for any information related to the burglary."It means nothing now, the damage is done. Officers were not willing to visit the restaurant," Vaghela told to local news outlets.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

In a separate incident, Laxman Das, an Indian sous chef in Dublin, was attacked and robbed while going to work. These incidents follow a series of recent assaults targeting Indians in Ireland, raising concerns about racism.  TOI correspondent from London: A six-year-old Indian-origin girl and an Indian sous chef are the latest victims in the ongoing spate of racist attacks targeting Indian nationals and Indian-origin Irish people in Ireland.The girl, whose family hail from Kottayam, Kerala, was playing outside her house in Waterford City, southeast Ireland, with friends at 7.30pm on Monday evening when a gang of boys and one girl called her a “dirty Indian” and told her to “go back to India”. She was born in Ireland. Five of the gang also punched her in the face, hit her private parts with a bicycle, punched her neck and twisted her hair.Her mother moved to Ireland eight years ago from Kottayam to work as a nurse with her husband and recently became an Irish citizen.The mother said the gang was made up of boys aged 12 to 14 and a girl aged eight. She said her daughter came home in floods of tears and is now too scared to play outside. She told the Irish Mirror: “I never expected that such an incident would happen. I thought she would be safe here. Even in front of our own house she can’t play safely. I am a nurse, I am doing my best to take care of people. I do my work and I am 100% professional. I changed my citizenship, but still we are called dirty people and even my kids are not safe. We came here to fill a labour gap. We are professionals — we have all the certificates…”The mother studied BSc Nursing at University of Calicut and went to Mount Carmel Higher Secondary School in Kottayam.“Gardaí (Irish national police) responded to a report of an alleged assault in the Kilbarry area of Waterford city on the evening of Monday 4 August. Investigations are ongoing,” a Garda spokesperson told TOI.On Wednesday morning Laxman Das from Kolkata, who works as a sous chef at the Anantara The Marker Dublin hotel, was assaulted near the Hilton Hotel by three people while on his way to work. He was taken to St Vincent's University Hospital.

The arrest occurred due to possession of a fake resident card. Authorities took him into custody in Niagara Falls, New York. He faces a potential 10-year prison sentence. The arrest is part of 'Operation Take Back America'. This initiative targets illegal immigration.  An Indian national has been arrested in the United States for allegedly possessing a forged alien resident card, according to the Justice Department. Swapnil Ramesh Tejale, 34, was taken into custody following a traffic stop in Niagara Falls, New York, and now faces a federal charge that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.“On July 10, 2025, the Niagara Falls Border Patrol Station received a request from the Niagara Falls Police Department to help identify three individuals that they had encountered during a traffic stop,” said Assistant US Attorney Michael J. Smith, who is prosecuting the case. “Agents arrived at the scene and questioned the three individuals as to their citizenship. Tejale presented a Lawful Permanent Resident Card but voluntarily admitted that the card was fictitious.”Authorities later confirmed that Tejale was in the country unlawfully and did not possess any valid immigration documents. Following his arrest, agents discovered a Social Security card in his name, which was also found to be counterfeit.The case falls under “Operation Take Back America”, a Justice Department initiative aimed at tackling illegal immigration and dismantling transnational criminal organisations. The operation seeks to “repel the invasion of illegal immigration” and “protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime”, the department said.The investigation was led by the US Border Patrol Niagara Falls Station, under the direction of Patrol Agent in Charge Brady Waikal.Tejale’s arrest is part of a series of immigration enforcement actions involving Indian nationals this year. In a related incident, an Indian man from Santa Rosa, California, was sentenced in March to six months in prison for conspiracy to transport aliens for profit. Meanwhile, Manjot Singh, a 25-year-old Indian national, was recently arrested in the Seattle area for repeat offences including robbery, assault, and criminal impersonation. Singh, who entered the U.S. illegally, is currently in ICE custody pending deportation.ICE officials have said that Singh’s arrest is a warning to repeat offenders: “Those who violate US laws while in the country illegally face arrest and deportation.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Viral footage shows firefighters inspecting the scene as the family performed the ritual. (Photo: X) A housewarming ceremony involving a Hindu havan at a Texas home took an unexpected turn when local firefighters arrived at the scene, mistaking the ritual for a fire emergency.The incident was captured on video. The footage has gone viral and has fuelled an online debate over cultural awareness and fire safety. The clip was originally shared on Instagram. It shows a fire truck from the Bedford fire department pulling up outside the house as smoke from the ceremony fills the garage. Inside, an Indian family can be seen performing a traditional havan, a religious ritual involving fire, as part of their housewarming puja.The video includes on-screen text stating, "Cultural misunderstanding 101: A Hindu puja is not a fire emergency. When you're having a housewarming havan and the fire department pulls up."Shortly after the fire crew arrives, they are seen speaking with members of the family and inspecting the area. However, it remains unclear whether any formal action was taken or if any fire codes were violated during the ritual.The footage has since been widely circulated across social media platforms, with users offering differing views on the incident. Some social media users criticised the family for conducting a ritual involving fire in a residential setting, arguing it could pose safety risks. Others defended the family’s right to observe their religious customs, calling the incident a clear example of cultural misunderstanding.No official comment was immeditaely released by the Bedford fire department.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Indian-origin Mathura Sridharan was appointed as Ohio's 12th solicitor general, inviting the wrath of online trolls who questioned why a 'non-US-origin' person was not picked for the post. Sridharan's LinkedIn went viral as critics questioned her credibility -- forcing Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost to issue a clarification, or a clapback at the trolls. Dave Yost, who announced Mathura's promotion, said Mathura is wrongly being portrayed as a non-American. "A few commenters have asserted incorrectly that Mathura is not American. She is a United States citizen, married to a US citizen, and the child of naturalized US citizens," he said. "If her name or her complexion bother you, the problem is not with her or her appointment," he added."Mathura is brilliant… she won her argument at SCOTUS last year. Both the SGs she worked under (Flowers & Gaiser) recommended her. I told her when I originally hired her I needed her to argue with me. She does… All the time! Excited to promote her. She will serve Ohio well," Yost wrote.Yost's clapback also met trolling as people commented that she is not "American-American". "Is she a Christian? That’s the biggest factor that concerns me. Based on the bindi on her forehead, I worry she is not," one wrote. "Another American job… given away to foreigners," another wrote. "She's Indian. They all have a loyalty first to other Indians. horrible pick. Totally un-American. the GOP is pathetic," a third user wrote."No one with the last name 'Sridharan' fought in the US Civil War. She's not an American," another wrote.Before joining the Ohio Solicitor’s Office, Mathura clerked for Judge Steven J. Menashi of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and Judge Deborah A. Batts of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. She holds a Juris Doctor from New York University School of Law, a Master’s Degree in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as a Bachelor’s Degree in Economics and in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

We welcome your feedback on articles but there has to be some parameters, and these are explained in our community house rules...We cannot tolerate hate. We cannot tolerate abuse towards individuals in our stories or other commenters," the company's social media policy says. Radio New Zealand had to do the same on the social media post on Ravishankar's appointment. "Under RNZ's comments policy, we will proactively disable comments on posts which may attract abusive or harmful comments or when resources are required elsewhere," a spokesperson for RNZ said. "In this instance, the comments were disabled after our monitoring found racist comments," the spokesperson said. "We want people to feel safe and respected on our community forums and will continue to proactively disable comments where necessary. We will not tolerate harmful communications."1News said it received a large number of comments on the post that announced Ravishankar's appointment and a vast majority were inappropriate.

After her TikTok video went viral, another ICE official offered help. Chatterjee highlights the broader issue of poor ICE communication, impacting immigrants facing detention and difficult bond policies, leading some to abandon their asylum claims. Trisha Chatterjee (Picture source: LinkedIn) Trisha Chatterjee, an Indian-origin immigration lawyer in Ohio, has alleged she was given the number of a Taco Bell outlet when she called ICE for urgent client support. Chatterjee posted about the incident on TikTok, where it went viral and ultimately led to help from another ICE official. But she says the larger issue lack of clear access to immigration authorities continues to cause serious harm to her clients."I called and they answered and they said, 'Hello, Taco Bell?' And I said, 'Taco Bell?' And the guy who was working said, 'Yeah, Taco Bell. Ma'am, you called me," Chatterjee recalled."I was in such disbelief," she said. "So, I called the ICE officer back, just really frustrated with what had just happened. He says, 'Oh, I'm sorry. I was trying to lighten the mood and make you laugh.'"ICE has denied the accusation. Homeland security called it a “lie and a smear.” Chatterjee stood by her version of events.Who is Trisha Chatterjee? Trisha Chatterjee is an Indian-origin immigration lawyer based in Greater Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio. She graduated from Miami University in 2020 and the University of Dayton School of Law in 2023.She works with the law office of Emily Feliz Garcia, a small immigration firm in Springdale. Before this, she worked at Abdallah law offices.For the last two years, she has handled immigration cases, especially those involving clients detained at the Butler County Jail in Ohio, which has a contract with ICE.Chatterjee was trying to submit "stay of removal" applications—urgent paperwork that can pause deportation for clients with pending immigration cases. ICE requires these to be submitted in person at the Detroit field office, but she hoped to file them locally in Blue Ash.After being unable to reach anyone by phone or email, she finally spoke to an ICE officer who gave her a phone number that turned out to be for Taco Bell. When she called back, the officer reportedly said he was trying to make her laugh.She posted a video about the incident on TikTok, which gained over 38,000 views. Many users sympathised, and one even helped her connect with a helpful ICE official in Blue Ash, who is now assisting her.Chatterjee said the larger problem is the lack of access and communication with ICE. She also highlighted how a stricter bond policy is making it harder for immigrants to stay out of detention during legal proceedings. Bonds can cost up to $50,000 and must be paid upfront.According to Chatterjee, some clients are abandoning their asylum cases or choosing to self-deport out of fear. She mentioned recent local arrests of people attending ICE check-ins, which has only deepened anxiety in immigrant communities.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Bhagwagar is expected to be arraigned Wednesday in Martinez, California.“Our office stands firmly committed to protecting children and holding those who cause harm accountable,” said Contra Costa county district attorney Diana Becton in a statement. “Every child deserves to feel safe, protected and heard when an injustice like this occurs.”According to the Contra Costa county sheriff’s office, detectives had been investigating Bhagwagar since April. His arrest was made with the assistance of Homeland Security Investigations after a warrant was issued.A short video published by aviation blog View From the Wing shows officers with badges exiting the plane’s cockpit.Delta Air Lines released a statement saying it was “appalled by reports of the charges related to the arrest” and confirmed that Bhagwagar had been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation. “Delta has zero tolerance for unlawful conduct,” the airline said.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani faces criticism for visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam due to his past support for defunding the police. Critics accuse Mamdani of shifting his stance for political gain, especially after his 2020 tweets resurfaced. Mamdani defends his actions, clarifying his current position on public safety and police funding. Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is facing backlash after visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam, as critics pointed to his past 2020 tweet supporting "defund the police" stance.The controversy erupted after Mamdani, who recently returned from a trip to Uganda, visited the grieving family of officer Islam, one of four victims killed in a mass shooting in Midtown Manhattan. Zohran Mamdani’s SECRET Wedding Triggers Fury Amid Local Tragedy | WATCHThe shooter, Shane Tamura, opened fire on Monday, killing Islam and three others before shooting himself.Sharing a post on X, Mamdani wrote: “Two days ago, an act of senseless violence took the lives of Officer Didarul Islam, Wesley LePatner, Aland Etienne, and Julia Hyman. Today, I visited Officer Islam's family and learned of his legacy. I ask you to join me in honoring the memory of these four New Yorkers.”However, the post quickly drew criticism, with users referencing Mamdani’s previous tweets during the height of the “Defund the Police” movement in 2020.Many accused him of changing his stance for political gain. One user wrote, “You can't go from defund the police to never mind I love the police. You're asking New Yorkers to forgo their guns meanwhile you just had a wedding in Uganda with armed guards.”While another posted, “Zohran Mamdani exposed as a total fraud. Mocking cops, calling them racist, then acting like he cares? No loyalty to America. He belongs in Uganda, not leading NYC. Deport him and protect our city!”Earlier at a press conference following his visit to the officer’s home in The Bronx, Mamdani addressed the criticism and attempted to clarify his position saying: “I am not defunding the police; I am not running to defund the police.”“Over the course of this race, I’ve been very clear about my view of public safety and the critical role that the police have in creating that public safety,” he added.Standing alongside members of the Bangladeshi American Police Association—of which Officer Islam was a member—and labor union 32BJ, which represented another victim, Aland Etienne, Mamdani tried to strike a unifying tone.During the peak of the "Defund the Police" movement in 2020, Zohran Mamdani repeatedly called for major cuts to the NYPD budget. In one post, he wrote, “We don’t need an investigation to know that the NYPD is racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety. What we need is to #DefundTheNYPD.”In another, he said, “There is no negotiating with an institution this wicked & corrupt. Defund it. Dismantle it. End the cycle of violence,” referencing budget talks around proposed NYPD cuts.Now, Mamdani has distanced himself from those remarks. When asked about them, he responded, “My statements in 2020 were made amidst a frustration that many New Yorkers held at the murder of George Floyd.”Mamdani claimed that his current stance is more nuanced, stating that his previous posts were “clearly out of step” with his recent campaign platform. He now supports maintaining the NYPD headcount while reducing its overtime budget.Despite this clarification, skepticism remains. Many police officers and political observers have accused Mamdani of shifting positions purely for political gain in a city where public safety remains a top concern for voters, New York Post reported.Adding to the political firestorm, former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams, who are both trailing Mamdani in early polling for the 2025 mayoral race, weighed in shortly after the shooting. Mamdani fired back, accusing Cuomo of politicising the tragedy saying, “It is beyond me that politicians are looking to use these days to score such cynical political points, on the very day that I held the father of Officer Islam in my arms and he could not utter a single word.”“For the former governor to spend an entire day speaking almost exclusively about me and barely about the New Yorkers who have been killed is indicative of the very politics New Yorkers want to leave in the past,” he added.All three, Mamdani, Cuomo, and Adams are expected to attend officer Islam’s funeral on Thursday.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The high court found him guilty of rape and outrage of modesty, following incidents at his Jurong West shop in 2021. Despite his denials and claims of erectile dysfunction, the judge deemed the victim's testimony credible.  An Indian national was sentenced to more than 14 years in jail on Thursday by the Singapore high court for sexually assaulting a minor, reports the Straits Times.Ramalingam Selvasekaran was handed a sentence of 14 years, three months and two weeks after being found guilty of rape and two counts of outrage of modesty after assaulting an 11-year-old at his provision shop in Jurong West.According to the court, the assaults occurred between 4.50 pm and 5.05 pm on October 28, 2021. The girl had visited Ramalingam’s store and returned later to buy ice cream. Prosecutors said he led her into a back area and forced her to perform oral sex. After the incident, the girl sought help from a passerby, who called the police.Ramalingam represented himself during the trial, which began on January 16. He was convicted on all charges on 7 July.“The fact that she had not run off after the first act of molest, or that she did not resist the assaults, or inform her grandfather, were all to my mind sufficiently explained, particularly given that she was still young and immature,” said Justice Aidan Xu, who found the girl’s account credible and consistent.Ramalingam’s earlier statements to police reportedly included admissions of hugging, kissing, and oral sex. However, he later denied any wrongdoing, claiming he was suffering from erectile dysfunction and that no DNA evidence was found on the victim.The judge ruled that these claims did not undermine the girl’s testimony. “While there was no dispute that Ramalingam suffered from erectile dysfunction, the prosecution’s expert witness gave a cogent explanation that oral rape remained possible,” Justice Xu was quoted as saying to Straits Times.Following sentencing on July 30, Ramalingam said he would appeal and was granted bail of S$80,000. He attempted to negotiate with the judge over the conditions, asking for the removal of his electronic tag and exemption from reporting to the Police Cantonment Complex. Both requests were denied.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The incidents, condemned by authorities and community leaders, are being treated as linked. This follows a separate racist assault in Adelaide, where an Indian man was brutally attacked after being told to "f--- off, Indian."  A Hindu temple in Melbourne’s eastern suburb of Boronia was defaced with racist graffiti this week prompting widespread condemnation and police investigation.As reported by The Brisbane Times and The Sydney Morning Herald, offensive red graffiti with the words “Go home” and other racial slurs were found daubed across the Shree Swaminarayan Temple on Wadhurst Drive, as well as two nearby Asian-operated restaurants Kingsland Chinese Restaurant and Charles King Dumpling.Police said a healing centre on Mountain Highway was also defaced the same night, bringing the total number of sites attacked to four. “There is absolutely no place at all in our society for hate-based and racist behaviour,” Victoria Police said in a statement. Authorities confirmed that all four incidents are being treated as linked and that an investigation is under way.PollShould harsher penalties be implemented for hate crimes?Yes, definitelyNo, current laws are sufficient'An attack on our right to worship'Makrand Bhagwat, President of the Hindu Council of Australia’s Victoria chapter, told Australia Today the vandalism of the temple was “heartbreaking” for the community. “Our temple is meant to be a sanctuary of peace, devotion and unity,” he said. “To have it targeted in this way feels like an attack on our identity, our right to worship and freedom of religion.”Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan sent a personal message of support to temple management. “What happened this week was hateful, racist and deeply disturbing,” she wrote. “It wasn’t just vandalism – it was a deliberate act of hate, designed to intimidate, isolate, and spread fear.”Local interfaith networks, including the City of Greater Knox’s Multifaith Network, have expressed support. “We want to show that love and solidarity triumph over hate,” said community leader Vikrant Thakur.Indian man targeted in racist attackThis came after a 23-year-old Indian man, Charanpreet Singh, was brutally attacked and left unconscious on a street in Adelaide following a reported racist assault linked to a parking dispute. According to 9News, the men allegedly told Singh to "f--- off, Indian" before launching a violent, unprovoked assault.“They just said ‘f--- off, Indian’, and after that they just started punching,” Singh said. “I tried to fight back, but they beat me until I was unconscious.”He sustained serious injuries, including brain trauma and facial fractures. A 20-year-old from Enfield was arrested and charged, but others involved remain at large.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Singh and his wife were allegedly ambushed by a group of men who shouted racial slurs before inflicting serious injuries. The incident has sparked outrage and renewed calls for enhanced safety measures for international students in the area.  An Indian international student has been hospitalised with serious injuries after a violent assault in Australia's Adelaide that is being investigated as a possible racially motivated attack. The incident has sparked outrage across the Indian community and renewed calls for better safety measures for international students.Charanpreet Singh, 23, was with his wife near Kintore Avenue on Saturday evening (July 19) when they were allegedly ambushed by a group of five men. According to Australia Today, the couple had just parked their car to view the city’s light displays around 9:22pm when the attackers emerged from another vehicle.Viral video shows assaultEyewitnesses and video footage shared on social media reportedly show the men striking Singh with what appeared to be metal knuckles or sharp objects, while shouting racial abuse including: “F--- off, Indian”. The attackers then fled the scene, leaving Singh unconscious and seriously injured on the road.PollWhat should be prioritized to improve safety for international students?Awareness campaigns and community supportStronger law enforcement and quicker actionSingh, who spoke to 9News from his hospital bed, said the altercation began over a car parking dispute but escalated into a racially charged assault. “They just said, ‘F--- off, Indian,’ and after that they just started punching,” he recalled. “You can change anything in your body, but you can’t change the colours.”He sustained facial fractures and brain trauma, and was taken by emergency services to the Royal Adelaide Hospital for overnight treatment. The assault has left members of the local Indian community shaken, with many expressing solidarity with Singh online.“When things like this happen, it makes you feel like you should go back,” Singh said.Police investigation under waySouth Australia Police confirmed they were called to Kintore Avenue shortly before 9.30pm and found Singh with facial injuries. “He was taken to hospital for treatment. Investigations are continuing,” a police spokesperson told The Indian Sun. One man, a 20-year-old from Enfield, has been arrested and charged with assault causing harm. The other suspects remain at large.Authorities are reviewing CCTV footage from the area and have urged witnesses to come forward. “We ask anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers,” the police said.Premier Peter Malinauskas has condemned the incident, calling it “completely unwelcome in our state”. He added, “Any time we see any evidence of any racial attack, it is just not consistent with where the majority of our community are at.”Another attack in DublinThis follows another attack targeting an Indian individual. An Indian man in his 40s was hospitalised after being brutally attacked by a group of teenage boys in a violent, racist assault in Dublin on Saturday evening. The gang falsely accused him of inappropriate behaviour with children before beating him and pulling down his trousers. “Gardaí in Tallaght were alerted to an incident at Parkhill Road... Investigations are ongoing,” police said. Councillor Baby Pereppadan said, “He couldn’t speak much because of the shock.” Sinn Féin’s Seán Crowe added, “You are sowing hate, fear, and division.” A protest is planned for July 26 to condemn rising racist violence in Ireland.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Her exit, surprising to many, opens an opportunity for the U.S. Treasury to propose a successor amidst global trade dynamic shifts. Gopinath, the first female chief economist, joined the IMF in 2019 and was promoted in 2022. Gita Gopinath (File photo) NEW DELHI: Gita Gopinath, the second-in-command at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), will step down at the end of August to return to her position at Harvard University, the IMF announced on Monday.The timing of Gita Gopinath’s exit has taken many within the IMF by surprise and is believed to have been prompted by her own decision, reported news agency Reuters. Having originally left Harvard to serve at the Fund, she is now set to resume her role as professor of economics at the university. Her departure opens a window for the US Treasury to propose a successor—an opportunity that comes as President Donald Trump pushes to reshape global trade dynamics and curb the country’s persistent trade deficits through sweeping tariffs on imports worldwide. Gopinath, who joined the IMF in 2019 as its first-ever female chief economist, was elevated to First Deputy Managing Director in January 2022. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva will appoint her successor “in due course,” the statement added.Gopinath had served as the first female chief economist of the Washington-based global lender for three years. Gopinath's research has been published in many top economics journals. Prior to her appointment as IMF Chief Economist, she was the John Zwaanstra Professor of International Studies and Economics in the economics department of Harvard University. Before joining the faculty of Harvard University in 2005, she was an assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.Gopinath, who considers herself a product of the Indian education system, she completed her schooling in Mysuru. She had her first brush with macro-economic challenges while doing her bachelor’s degree at Lady Shri Ram College, Delhi, with India experiencing its first major external financing and currency crisis in 1990-91. “This inspired me to pursue graduate work in economics and was the foundation for my interest in international finance,” she had told in an interview in 2010.Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.AI Masterclass for Students.

The case relates to the death of Piang Ngaih Don, a domestic worker from Myanmar, who died on July 26, 2016, from brain injuries caused by repeated blunt trauma. At the time of her death, she was severely malnourished, weighing just 24 kilograms.'Nothing Comes Free, Won't Stop...': Singapore PM's Big Announcement At Military EventAccording to Channel News Asia, Chelvam, who was Don’s legal employer, allowed her to be abused over several months by his ex-wife, Gaiyathiri Murugayan, and his mother-in-law, Prema S Narayanasamy. Murugayan and Narayanasamy are already serving 30-year and 17-year sentences, respectively, for their roles in the abuse.PollShould there be stricter laws against domestic abuse?Yes, absolutelyNo, current laws are enoughDistrict Judge Teoh Ai Lin noted Chelvam’s failure to intervene or protect Don, despite witnessing her deteriorating condition. He also removed the home’s CCTV recorder to conceal evidence and lied to investigators.Prosecutor Sean Teh said video footage showed Chelvam present during several episodes of abuse and accused him of supporting the starvation that contributed to Don’s death.Chelvam was acquitted on a fifth charge of using criminal force.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The suspects were arrested in connection with a kidnapping and torture case. The case involved an international Punjabi street gang. The gang is accused of running a brutal extortion racket. The racket stretches from California to murder plots in India. Authorities in California and the FBI are investigating eight Indian-origin suspects arrested in San Joaquin County for allegedly kidnapping and torturing a man as part of an international extortion scheme. The gang, led by Pavittar Singh, wanted in India for multiple murders, targeted Indian-Americans. JALANDHAR: Investigating the eight Indian-origin suspects arrested in San Joaquin County, California, on July 11, county authorities and FBI said the international Punjabi street gang kidnapped a local man, stripped him naked, and tortured him for hours as part of a brutal extortion racket that stretches from California'to murder plots in India.The authorities have urged Indian-Americas to report such extortion threats.Addressing a joint press conference, they revealed the gang leader, Pavittar Singh, was also wanted in India for multiple murders and firearms offences, including a killing in Batala, Punjab.Indian Student Handcuffed at Newark Airport in US to Be Deported; India Protests, Seeks ExplanationPollDo you think the involvement of international authorities is necessary in this case?Yes, it’s crucialNo, local authorities can handle itFBI also cited earlier US arrests of Indian gang leaders: Gurdev 'Jassal' Singh (RPG attacks), Harpreet Singh, also known as Happy Passia, Lawrence Bishnoi's brother Anmol , linked to the murder of singer Sidhu Moose Wala, and others.8 Indian-origin suspects face life in jail without bailEight suspects, led by Pavittar, now face charges of kidnapping for ransom, torture and illegal weapons that carry life sentences. A multi-agency SWAT sweep on July 11 had netted machine guns, an assault rifle, and $15,000 cash stashed in a ceiling vent.Sheriff Patrick Withrow said they were tipped off on June 21 about a horrendous crime that occurred on June 19 in the Manteca area. They contacted the victim and, on July 11, their AGNET Unit — alongside SWAT teams from FBI, Stockton police, Manteca police and Stanislaus County sheriff's office — executed five coordinated search warrants across the county and arrested the suspects. Withrow said the purpose of the torture was to extract names of other potential extortion targets in the Indian-American business community. Elaborating on the federal and international angle, Sid Patel from FBISacramento field office said Pavittar was wanted in India for firearm violations, assault and multiple murders abroad. He revealed six of the eight suspects were picked up by ICE ERO for immigration proceedings, and FBI was coordinating with India and Canada on extradition after US sentences.San Joaquin County District Attorney Ron Freitas told the press conference that they filed two complaints charging the eight men with serious gang-related crimes, including kidnapping, torture, extortion, witness intimidation, and multiple weapon violations. They said the suspects faced life in prison, with no bail and no exceptions.Apart from Pavitar, other members of the gang included Dilpreet Singh, Sarbjit Singh, Gurtaj Singh, Amritpall Singh, Vishal Singh, Arshpreet Singh, and Manpreet Randhawa. According to the sheriff and FBI, the gang operations included extortion of Indian-American business owners, forced free labour, violent truck cargo hijackings along Central Valley, weapons and drug trafficking, and international political violence (RPG attacks, assassinations, grenade assaults on police stations in India).Each of the accused faces a life-in-prison baseline for kidnapping for ransom, along with firearm and gang enhancements that could push to life without parole. The sheriff even said, "Suspects are animals with little or no regard for human life."Announcing the setting up of an anonymous tip line specifically for this case, the sheriff urged Indian-American residents to report extortion and intimidation attempts. "Help us hunt the rest of this gang — call us."About the AuthorIP SinghIP Singh is Senior Assistant Editor at The Times of India.

Harris courts Republicans with events on abortion rights, border security, and small business creation, while Trump takes stances that upset some conservatives. Both aim to expand their coalitions before the election. Kamala Harris trolled for 'fake accent'Kamala Harris trolled for 'fake accent' Kamala Harris trolled for 'fake accent'Kamala Harris trolled for 'fake accent' Kamala Harris trolled for 'fake accent'1234 In a surprising turn of events, US presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are blurring party lines as they vie for votes in the final stretch of a highly competitive election.Harris has been actively courting Republican voters, hosting events focused on issues such as abortion rights, border security, and small business creation, which have featured Republican officials.The Democratic National Convention even granted speaking slots to seven Republicans last month, and outside groups are spending millions to help Harris connect with disaffected opposing party members.Simultaneously, Harris has adopted a more assertive foreign policy stance, pledging to include a Republican in her Cabinet if elected and openly discussing her gun ownership."If somebody breaks in my house they're getting shot. Sorry," Harris told Oprah Winfrey, surprising the television star with her candour. Harris' strong support for US leadership on the global stage has already earned her the backing of more than 100 Republican national security and foreign policy officials who previously served under various presidents, including Dick Cheney.Trump, on the other hand, has taken positions that have irked some conservatives. He recently called for a federal cap on credit card interest rates at 10%. He expressed support for a federal law mandating insurance companies to cover in vitro fertilization (IVF), despite opposition from social conservatives who believe embryos used in the process should be protected.Barbara Comstock, a former Republican congresswoman from Virginia who co-chaired Nikki Haley's GOP presidential campaign, now supports Harris, citing her call for an expanded child care tax credit, support for a tough bipartisan immigration bill, and a foreign policy stance in contrast to Trump's admiration for leaders like Vladimir Putin.Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii and now a top Trump ally, describes Trump's policy approach as "common sense," highlighting his support for criminal justice reform and a foreign policy philosophy that seeks to avoid US involvement in global conflicts like the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Despite the candidates' embrace of policies that appeal to the other side, their priorities still largely align with their party's traditions.Trump opposes abortion rights and plans to vote to uphold a Florida law banning abortions after six weeks, while Harris supports abortion rights as protected under Roe v. Wade, backs a ban on assault weapons, and wants to extend prescription drug cost caps to all Americans.As the election draws near, both candidates are working to expand their coalitions. Trump's spokesman, Brian Hughes, argues that the GOP nominee has appeal among African Americans, Hispanics, and labour union members, citing the Teamsters Union's decision not to endorse either candidate as a significant win for Trump.Meanwhile, Harris, who has only been in the presidential race for eight weeks, is beginning to articulate specific policy plans that favour liberal policies in most cases, such as combating climate change, supporting labour unions, and pushing for voting rights legislation to combat racial discrimination.

(AP) WASHINGTON: The United States said Thursday that Russia is on the verge of unleashing a massive military attack against Ukraine, dismissing Moscow's claim to be pulling forces back, as artillery fire hit a Ukrainian kindergarten.In a dramatic, previously unscheduled speech to the United Nations in New York, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said intelligence showed Moscow could order an assault on its neighbor in the "coming days."With US and other Western governments saying they see no evidence of Russia's claim to be withdrawing, Blinken challenged the Kremlin to "announce today with no qualification, equivocation or deflection that Russia will not invade Ukraine.""Demonstrate it by sending your troops, your tanks, your planes, back to their barracks and hangers," he said.Russia denies any invasion plans but warned of "military-technical measures" if its far-reaching demands for a US and NATO pullback from eastern Europe aren't satisfied.The United States said late Thursday that Blinken and his Moscow counterpart Sergei Lavrov had agreed to meet next week -- provided there was no invasion before then.Keeping up the pressure, President Joe Biden accused Moscow of preparing a "false flag operation" as a pretext for an attack."They have not moved any of their troops out. They've moved more troops in," Biden said. "Every indication we have is that they're prepared to go into Ukraine."He added, however, that diplomacy is not dead. "There is a path. There is a way through this," he said.Biden will hold a phone meeting Friday with the leaders of Germany, Britain, France, the European Union and NATO to discuss the Ukraine crisis.Russia has massed enormous air, land and sea forces around Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin and officials say the troops are only conducting practice exercises.However, Putin has made clear that the price for removing any threat would be Ukraine agreeing never to join NATO and for the Western alliance to pull back from a swath of eastern Europe, effectively splitting the continent into Cold War-style spheres of influence.The United States said that it had received Putin's response to its offers of a diplomatic solution to the crisis, but did not give any reaction to the contents.The Russian foreign ministry indicated that there was little to discuss."In the absence of will on the American side to negotiate firm and legally binding guarantees on our security from the United States and its allies, Russia will be forced to respond, including with military-technical measures," the foreign ministry said."We insist on the withdrawal of all US armed forces in Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Baltics."Russia also expelled the number two US diplomat in Moscow, the US State Department said, condemning the "unprovoked" action.Russia took over Ukraine's Crimea region and began backing heavily armed separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Lugansk regions in 2014, sparking a war that has already cost thousands of lives.Sporadic fighting remains common in the east, and the Ukrainian army accused the pro-Russian separatists of 34 ceasefire breaches on Thursday, 28 of them using heavy weapons.The potentially most serious incident -- an example of the kind of spark that many fear could ignite far more intense fighting -- was the shelling of a kindergarten in the village of Stanytsia-Luganska. Children were inside but none were hit.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted that the attack "by pro-Russian forces is a big provocation."Russian news agencies quoted authorities in the separatist Lugansk region saying they blamed Kyiv after the situation on the frontline "escalated significantly."Western capitals say they are also concerned by the Russian parliament's request that Putin grant unilateral recognition of independence for the separatists in eastern Ukraine."If this request were accepted, it would... demonstrate a Russian decision to choose a path of confrontation over dialogue," British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said.Putin earlier this week claimed with no evidence that Ukraine is committing "genocide" in the eastern region.Moscow has made several announcements of troop withdrawals this week and on Thursday said that tank units had begun returning to their bases from near Ukraine.The United States, NATO and Ukraine all said they had seen no evidence of a pullback, with Washington saying Russia had in fact moved 7,000 more troops near the border.According to US officials, there are now about 150,000 Russian troops arrayed in offensive groupings on the southern, eastern and northern borders of Ukraine.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  5 signs of a master manipulator, as per psychology5 traditional Indian hair oils for hair growthBigg Boss Kannada 11: Full and final list of contestantsFrom Golla getting his first seat on the flight to missing the last cable car in Interlaken; A look at Bharti Singh and Haarsh Limbachiyaa's first Europe Trip with their little munchkin5 sneakers you should stay away from; a Nike shoe is also on the list!5 body language tips to appear more confidentTop 5 Indian states with the highest per capita incomeWeekly Horoscope: September 30th to October 6th, 20247 vegetables that reduce belly fat quickly5 psychology tricks to make people magically like you123Hot PicksTirupati Laddu Case Hearing LiveDaylight Savings 2024Erika Carr UtahPakistan Job CutsNepal FloodsAir Canada FinedStock Market TodayTOP TRENDINGRafale Marine Flight JetsHarvard Application ProcessWho is Parita ParekhPaul HeymanDelhi Dwarka ExpresswayWWE Royal RumbleBad Blood 2024Carlos AlcarazMohammed SirajBrain Exercises to Boost MemoryTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website9 Timeless Skills That Will Always Be in Demand7 Effective Ways for Professionals to Enhance Productivity and Cultivate Inner Peace12 Effective Ways to Improve Handwriting for ExamsStock market crash today: BSE Sensex plunges over 1,200 points; Nifty50 ends below 25,850 - top reasons markets have tankedTNA Star Eric Young shared his thoughts on the docuseries about WWE’s former chairmanWho is Parita Parekh, youngest Indian entrepreneur and a Stanford alumnaSeventeen KIIT Athletics Who Participated in Paris Olympics & Paralympics Felicitated By Varsity'Team India ka Ghajini kaun hai?' - Rohit Sharma answers10 Common Habits That Could Be Hindering Your SuccessJ&K police head constable Bashir Ahmed killed after gunning down terrorist in Kathua encounterAs Biden calls for ceasefire, Israel tells US it will launch ground offensive in Lebanon soonHigh stakes in J&K polls phase 3: 415 candidates vie for 40 constituenciesKashmir’s ‘X factor’: Is he only a vote cutter or is he the real deal?'Fanatic theocrats leading you to abyss': Netanyahu warns IraniansMuda case: K'taka CM's wife offers to surrender 14 plotsSA20 Auction: Players, squads, date - everything you need to knowExplained: Silicon-carbon batteries have arrived in phones.

And scientists say the exceptionally hot year is part of a long-term warming trend that shows hints of accelerating. Two U.S. science agencies - NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - and a private measuring group released their calculations for last year's global temperature on Thursday, and all said it wasn't far behind ultra-hot 2016 and 2020. Six different calculations found 2021 was between the fifth and seventh hottest year since the late 1800s. NASA said 2021 tied with 2018 for sixth warmest, while NOAA puts last year in sixth place by itself, ahead of 2018. Scientists say a La Nina - natural cooling of parts of the central Pacific that changes weather patterns globally and brings chilly deep ocean water to the surface - dampened global temperatures just as its flip side, El Nino, boosted them in 2016.  Still, they said 2021 was the hottest La Nina year on record and that the year did not represent a cooling off of human-caused climate change but provided more of the same heat. "So it's not quite as headline-dominating as being the warmest on record, but give it another few years and we'll see another one of those" records, said climate scientist Zeke Hausfather of the Berkeley Earth monitoring group that also ranked 2021 the sixth hottest. "It's the long-term trend, and it's an indomitable march upward." Gavin Schmidt, the climate scientist who heads NASA's temperature team, said "the long-term trend is very, very clear. And it's because of us. And it's not going to go away until we stop increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere." The last eight years have been the eight hottest on record, NASA and NOAA data agree. Global temperatures, averaged over a 10-year period to take out natural variability, are nearly 2 degrees (1.1 degrees Celsius) warmer than 140 years ago, their data shows.  The other 2021 measurements came from the Japanese Meteorological Agency and satellite measurements by Copernicus Climate Change Service i n Europe and the University of Alabama in Huntsville. There was such a distinctive jump in temperatures about eight to 10 years ago that scientists have started looking at whether the rise in temperatures is speeding up. Both Schmidt and Hausfather said early signs point to that but it's hard to know for sure. "I think you can see the acceleration, but whether it's statistically robust is not quite clear," Schmidt said in an interview. "If you just look at the last the last 10 years, how many of them are way above the trend line from the previous 10 years? Almost all of them." The global average temperature last year was 58.5 degrees (14.7 Celsius), according to NOAA. In 1988, NASA's then-chief climate scientist James Hansen grabbed headlines when he testified to Congress about global warming in a year that was the hottest on record at the time. Now, the 57.7 degrees (14.3 Celsius) of 1988 ranks as the 28th hottest year on record.  Last year, 1.8 billion people in 25 Asian, African and Middle Eastern nations had their hottest years on record, including China, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Iran, Myanmar and South Korea, according to Berkeley Earth. The deep ocean, where most heat is stored in the seas, also set a record for warmth in 2021, according to a separate new study. "Ocean warming, aside from causing coral bleaching and threatening sea life and fish populations we rely upon for roughly 25% of our protein intake globally, is destabilizing Antarctic ice shelves and threatens massive ... sea level rise if we don't act," said study co-author Michael Mann, a Pennsylvania State University climate scientist. The last time Earth had a cooler than normal year by NOAA or NASA calculations was 1976. That means 69% of the people on the planet - more than 5 billion people under age 45 - have never experienced such a year, based on United Nations data. North Carolina state climatologist Kathie Dello, 39, who wasn't part of the new reports but said they make sense, said, "I've only lived in a warming world and I wish that the younger generations did not have to say the same. It didn't have to be this way."End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  Bigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial show5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the world​Bigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8​Bigg Boss 18: From Shehzada Dhami making serious allegations against Rajan Shahi to Alice Kaushik opening up about her parents’ demise: Major highlights from the show5 types of people one should completely avoid for peace in life, as per psychology10 most powerful countries in the world in 20245 minimalist habits to stop wasting your time​10 most educated countries of the world​From Aamir Khan's warm surprise with son Junaid to a musical tribute; A look at Amitabh Bachchan's 82nd Birthday celebration on the sets of Kaun Banega Crorepati 167 vegetables that reduce belly fat quicklyHow tall are Trump family membersTGIKS 2: From impersonating legendary cricketer MS Dhoni to revealing secrets from the World Cup: Top moments featuring Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and others123Hot PicksAssembly Election Result 2024 DateIsrael Hezbollah War Live2024 Nobel Prize in MedicineHaryana Assembly Constituencies 2024AIIMS Doctors Candle MarchPakistan Airport ExplosionChennai Air Show ChaosTOP TRENDINGElection Result Date and TimeKayla NicoleBasit AliWorld Richest FamilyThe San Francisco 49ersIsrael MossadRRB JE Exam DatePresident MuizzuJimmy UsosSadhguru QuotesTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteElection Results 2024 Live: Stage set in J&K, Haryana for first major BJP vs Congress showdown since Lok Sabha pollsTravis Kelce's Ex Kayla Nicole Delivers a Powerful 'Mental Health' Message While Facing Backlash from Taylor Swift Fans"Travis Kelce's career is over": Travis Kelce’s time in Kansas City may be numbered as the Chiefs decided to re-sign one of their familiar faces9 Powerful Quotes to Motivate Students Towards Success Through Hard WorkTop 10 Largest Economies In The World 2025: India To Become 4th Largest Economy Soon!

Israel on Thursday approved a fourth dose of vaccine for people with weakened immune systems, and Britain’s National Health Service said its hospitals would erect field wards to help deal with the surge in coronavirus cases.Several US states hit their all-time case records for coronavirus cases this week, disrupting the lives of millions of Americans. New York Mayor-elect Eric Adams vowed to keep the city’s vaccine mandate for private-sector employees in place, and the CDC issued a blunt warning to potential travelers: “Avoid cruise travel regardless of vaccination status.”Health officials are trying to encourage more Americans to get a booster shot — just over one-third of fully vaccinated adults have received one — and warn that the unvaccinated face the greatest risk of severe illness and death from omicron.“Our CDC guidance has been very clear that people should get their boost when they are eligible,” Dr. Rochelle PWalensky, the CDC director, told reporters this week. “That is both for — because of waning immunity and because we need more protection against Omicron.”Walensky said Wednesday that even as daily case counts had climbed by roughly 60% in the past week, hospitalizations and deaths were still relatively low, a suggestion that omicron might be less lethal. She and Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, cited international research hinting at the same conclusion.Studies have shown that while two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine have provided strong protection as the delta variant swarmed the country, omicron can evade the defenses of fully vaccinated people, heightening fears about the risks for young people.More than 70% of people 12 and older in the United States are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. Around one-quarter of children between 5 and 11 have received at least one dose. Children under 5 are still not eligible for a vaccine.The latest surge has caused a concerning rise in hospitalizations among children. But early data suggests that omicron appears to be causing milder illness for children, similar to findings for adults. And hospital officials and physicians have said that nearly all children hospitalized with Covid-19 were unvaccinated or partially vaccinated.Children can better withstand coronavirus infections but in rare instances can still become very sick and even die. At least 1.8 million adolescents between 12 and 15 years old have tested positive for the virus, according to the CDC.A series of studies published Thursday by the agency underscored how important vaccination can be for children and adolescents. In one study spanning July through early December that examined hundreds of adolescents in Arizona, researchers said two doses of the vaccine reduced the risk of infection by 92%.Two other CDC studies showed that there were few serious side effects reported among 5- to 11-year-olds who had received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and that pediatric hospitalizations occurred mostly among children who had not been fully vaccinated.A recent South African study showed that the effectiveness of Pfizer’s vaccine against severe illness and hospitalization was about 70% after two doses, against omicron in particular.Of the three federally authorized coronavirus shots, Pfizer-BioNTech's is the only vaccine approved for use in people under 18.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory committee is planning to meet by the middle of next week to weigh in on whether to recommend the changes in the FDA’s booster policy. If the committee agrees with the FDA’s authorizations, Walensky is expected to promptly endorse the revisions.Dr. Kathryn M. Edwards, a vaccine expert and professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said the FDA’s expected decision was justified.“We’re having a lot of suggestions and a lot of experience with omicron that it’s infecting people that have been boosted. But fortunately, we’re not seeing a lot of severe disease,” she said. “So I think if you look at the immune responses, at least in adults, you’ll see that this booster dose does enhance your neutralization capacity against omicron.”Other vaccine experts said the administration’s continued attention to offering boosters to younger, healthier people was misguided.Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, said research on vaccine effectiveness, including against omicron, had revealed that two doses offer substantial and durable protection against severe disease, including in adolescents — the purpose of vaccination, he said.A booster dose could increase a person's protection for several months, he said, but delivering extra shots to young Americans was “focusing on the people who are already protected.”The Biden administration, he added, should instead direct more attention to reaching the unvaccinated, a point he said was backed up by the overwhelming majority of hospitalized children he had seen in Philadelphia being unvaccinated.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the worldBigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial show​Bigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8​10 most powerful countries in the world in 20247 vegetables that reduce belly fat quickly​10 most educated countries of the world​How tall are Trump family membersTGIKS 2: From impersonating legendary cricketer MS Dhoni to revealing secrets from the World Cup: Top moments featuring Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and othersWhere the zodiac signs would prefer to liveFrom Bharti Singh- Elvish Yadav getting summoned in Rs 500 crore fraud case to Khushi Mali replacing Palak Sindhwani in Taarak Mehta: Top TV newsSunny Deol's 'Gadar', Shah Rukh Khan's 'Devdas', Rishi Kapoor's 'Chandni': Movies allegedly rejected by GovindaOptical illusion psychology test: The first thing you see reveals the hidden flaw affecting your relationships123Hot PicksIsrael Hezbollah War LiveBhopal Factory Drug SeizeGang Attack in HaitiAIIMS Doctors Candle MarchPakistan Airport ExplosionChennai Air Show ChaosHurricane Milton EvacuationTOP TRENDINGKarachi Airport BlastKayla NicoleWorld Richest FamilyThe San Francisco 49ersIsrael MossadPrince WilliamPresident MuizzuChinese Spy BallonsRishabh PantSadhguru QuotesTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website"Travis Kelce's career is over": Travis Kelce’s time in Kansas City may be numbered as the Chiefs decided to re-sign one of their familiar facesTravis Kelce's Ex Kayla Nicole Delivers a Powerful 'Mental Health' Message While Facing Backlash from Taylor Swift Fans'Diddy List': Names of celebrities connected to Sean Combs viral3 dead in Chennai after Indian Air Force air showFour spectators dead after Chennai air showPresident Muizzu in India: 'Will never hurt India's security interests, Maldives first but will prioritise ties with India'1 dead, 10 injured in massive explosion near Karachi airportIAF quietly shooting down 'Chinese spy balloons' at high altitudes'Wouldn't have given birth': Gaza mother struggles to provide for newborns amid conflictRishabh Pant's Masterclass: How India conquered the fortress GabbaMiracle at 17,000 ft: How two US & UK climbers were rescued from HimalayasRahul's heartfelt cooking session with Dalit man, his family;

Lance Lowry (Agency photo) NEW YORK: At a Georgia state House of Representatives hearing on prison conditions in September, a corrections officer called in to testify, interrupting his shift to tell lawmakers how dire conditions had become. On a "good day," he told lawmakers, he had maybe six or seven officers to supervise roughly 1,200 people. He said he had recently been assigned to look after 400 prisoners by himself.There weren't enough nurses to provide medical care. "All the officers ... absolutely despise working there," said the officer, who didn't give his name for fear of retaliation. In Texas, Lance Lowry quit after 20 years as a corrections officer to become a long-haul trucker because he couldn't bear the job any longer. Watching friends and coworkers die from COVID-19, along with dwindling support from his superiors, wore on him. "I would have liked to stay till I was 50," said Lowry, 48. "But the pandemic changed that." Staff shortages have long been a challenge for prison agencies, given the low pay and grueling nature of the work. But the coronavirus pandemic - and its impact on the labor market - has pushed many corrections systems into crisis. Officers are retiring and quitting in droves, while officials struggle to recruit new employees. And some prisons whose populations dropped during the pandemic have seen their numbers rise again, exacerbating the problem. There is no one thing pushing prison employees out in high numbers now. Some are leaving for new opportunities as more places are hiring. University of Michigan economist Betsey Stevenson pointed to the increased risk of COVID-19 for people working in prisons. "When jobs become riskier, it becomes harder to attract workers," she wrote in an email. "By failing to protect prisoners from COVID, the criminal justice system not only created an unfair risk of severe illness and death for the incarcerated, but the increased COVID risk to employees has undoubtedly contributed to staffing shortages." Unions representing prison officers in states including Massachusetts and California and at the federal level also claim vaccine mandates will drive out unvaccinated employees and exacerbate understaffing, though it's unclear how big of an impact those rules will have. "There are dozens of reasons to leave and very few to stay," said Brian Dawe, national director of One Voice United, a nonprofit supporting corrections officers. "Understaffing, poor pay, poor benefits, horrendous working conditions. Officers and their families in many jurisdictions have had enough." Employers from construction companies to restaurants are having difficulty hiring and keeping people. Nearly 3% of American workers, 4.3 million, quit their jobs in August, according to new data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the stakes are higher in prisons, where having fewer guards means significantly more dangerous conditions for incarcerated people. And for the officers left behind, worsening shortages have made an already difficult job unbearable, many say. In Georgia, some prisons report up to 70% vacancy rates. In Nebraska, overtime hours have quadrupled since 2010, as fewer officers are forced to work longer hours. Florida has temporarily closed three prisons out of more than 140 because of understaffing, and vacancy rates have nearly doubled there in the last year. And at federal prisons across the country, guards are picketing in front of their facilities over understaffing, while everyone from prison teachers to dentists is pulled in to cover security shifts. In recent weeks, reporters from The Marshall Project and The Associated Press have spoken with workers, officials, attorneys and people incarcerated in more than a dozen prison systems to understand the consequences of the staffing shortfalls. The federal Bureau of Prisons says about 93% of its front-line guard positions are filled, with little more than 1,000 vacancies, though workers in many prisons say they're feeling the pinch as others are conscripted to fill in for missing officers. Asked last week in a U.S. Senate hearing about federal prison staffing, Attorney General Merrick Garland said, "I agree this is a serious problem at the Bureau of Prisons." Garland told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco was working with the bureau to address staffing issues. Inside prisons, growing shortages mean a rise in lockdowns. Restrictions that might have begun as a way to stop the spread of COVID-19 have continued because there aren't enough guards to supervise activities. Some incarcerated people say they can't take classes, participate in group therapy sessions or even work out in the recreation yard or take a shower. That can force those in general population into de facto solitary confinement, and those already in segregation into near-total lockdown. "If we get rec once a week, that's a good week," said Anthony Haynes, who is on Texas' death row in a unit that is barely half-staffed. "We don't always get showers." A spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice did not respond to Haynes' claims but acknowledged that staffing is a challenge in Texas' prisons. "Before COVID-19, staffing was frequently impacted by economic surges and competing employment opportunities," said spokesman Robert Hurst in an email. "The pandemic has exacerbated these issues. We also recognize that the job of the correctional officer is one of the most difficult in all of state government." He added that Texas has closed six of its more than 100 facilities in the last year due to staffing problems. Kansas has cut job training and reduced supervision for people after they're released. Two-thirds of the men in Nebraska's prisons can't see visitors on the weekends - when most families are free to travel - because of understaffing. Dr. Homer Venters, a former chief medical officer for the jail system in New York City, inspects conditions in prisons around the country for court cases. Understaffing will lead to an increase in preventable prison deaths, he said, as the quality of care reaches new lows. "Things are much worse behind bars now than they have been for a long time," Venters said. "There are so many staff that have left. That means that basic clinical services, like getting to scheduled appointments, just isn't happening the way it was even five years ago."End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  Bigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial showSchengen visa denials: 5 countries with the highest rejection ratesSanjay Dutt-Manyata to Hardik Pandya-Natasa Stankovic: Bollywood couples who renewed their wedding vows5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the world8 animals that help Earth heal and how5 psychology tips to be more mature in life and relationships10 most powerful countries in the world in 2024From getting kicked out from Shark Tank India 4 to marrying a Mexico-based model, buying India’s first : Times when Deepinder Goyal made headlines​Bigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8​123Hot PicksUS Election Timeline 2024World's Fastest JetsDelhi Drugs in NamkeenHarris vs Trump Latest PollsUP Scholarships Non-Creamy LayerMahadev Betting AppStock market todayTOP TRENDINGRic FlairNavi Mumbai AirportPrince HarryNFL Week SeasonActor NithinIPL FranchisesAyudha Puja DateRatan TataKali Crown BangladeshDiddy ListTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website“When you know, you know”: Russell Wilson’s Wife Ciara Revealed That She Knew Wilson Was The One After Their First DateTollywood actor Nithin arrested for snatching gold chain in HyderabadRatan Tata’s successor: Noel Tata appointed chairman of Tata TrustsDiwali 2024 Date: When is Deepawali?

(Agency photo) NEW YORK: US President Thomas Jefferson's statue, a presence for more than a century in the New York City Council chamber, is coming down following a public commission reassessment of the legacy of the founding father who was also a slaveholder. The New York City Public Design Commission voted unanimously on Monday to dismantle the 7-foot (2.13-meter) bronze likeness of Jefferson, which has watched over proceedings in the most populous U.S.city since 1915. The commission agreed to lend the 187-year-old statue long-term to the New-York Historical Society. It is a plaster model of a statue still on display in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. "Jefferson embodied some of the most shameful parts of our country's long and nuanced history," Councilperson Adrienne Adams, co-chair of the council's Black, Latino and Asian Caucus, told the commission. "It is time for the city to turn the page and move forward." Similar monuments have become a target of anti-racism protests in recent years. Statues of Civil War Confederate leaders have also been dismantled.Jefferson's place in U.S. history is complex. Having written that "all men are created equal" as the primary author of the Declaration of Independence, he also enslaved more than 600 people and fathered at least six children with Sally Hemings, a woman he enslaved. Not everyone supported the removal of the statue. Sean Wilentz, a American history professor at Princeton University, wrote in a letter read to the commission: "The statue specifically honors Jefferson for his greatest contribution to America, indeed, to humankind."

(Getty Images)  WASHINGTON: Pakistan and its intelligence service have played a key role in fostering the Taliban and allowing it to eventually take over Afghanistan, a top Republican lawmaker has alleged, stating that it is disgusting to watch Islamabad celebrate the group's victory that will bring "untold brutality" to Afghans.Congressman Steve Chabot, Co-Chair of the India Caucus, said in his address to the virtual gala of Hindu Political Action Committee on Sunday that he applauds the Indian government for welcoming the Afghan religious minorities who have a good reason to fear persecution at the hands of the Taliban and their evil rule.“In contrast, we all know that Pakistan and particularly its intelligence services played a key role fostering the Taliban and allowing them to eventually take over. It's just disgusting to watch Pakistani officials celebrate the victory of this group that will bring untold brutality to the Afghan people,” Chabot said.“Pakistan's own persecution of religious minorities, however, gets a lot less attention here in America than it deserves. We would do well to educate our fellow citizens about these abuses. Persecution is particularly manifests in the heinous practice of the kidnapping, force conversion to Islam and forced marriage of underage Hindu girls to older Muslim men,” he said.Such allegations are not mere hearsay, he noted.Major news organisations and human rights groups have documented the practice with so many heartbreaking stories of girls in their early teens taken from their families, and traffic into forced marriages. These abuses are often just ignored, said the Congressman.In his address, Chabot said that with roughly 6 million Hindus in America, Hindus are unquestionably an integral part of society throughout the United States.“Through strong work ethic and high educational attainment, Hindus exemplify the American dream. These virtues also allow Hindus to take on key roles in communities across the country, and also give back to those communities in so many ways,” he said.That is why the reports of a rise in discrimination against Hindu Americans around the country are so concerning, he rued, adding that there is no place in America for such discrimination.“We must all seek ways to bring it to an end,” Chabot added.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  Bigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial show5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the world​Bigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8​Bigg Boss 18: From Shehzada Dhami making serious allegations against Rajan Shahi to Alice Kaushik opening up about her parents’ demise: Major highlights from the show5 types of people one should completely avoid for peace in life, as per psychology10 most powerful countries in the world in 20245 minimalist habits to stop wasting your time​10 most educated countries of the world​From Aamir Khan's warm surprise with son Junaid to a musical tribute; A look at Amitabh Bachchan's 82nd Birthday celebration on the sets of Kaun Banega Crorepati 167 vegetables that reduce belly fat quicklyHow tall are Trump family membersTGIKS 2: From impersonating legendary cricketer MS Dhoni to revealing secrets from the World Cup: Top moments featuring Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and others123Hot PicksAssembly Election Result 2024 DateIsrael Hezbollah War Live2024 Nobel Prize in MedicineHaryana Assembly Constituencies 2024AIIMS Doctors Candle MarchPakistan Airport ExplosionChennai Air Show ChaosTOP TRENDINGElection Result Date and TimeKayla NicoleBasit AliWorld Richest FamilyThe San Francisco 49ersIsrael MossadRRB JE Exam DatePresident MuizzuJimmy UsosSadhguru QuotesTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteElection Results 2024 Live: Stage set in J&K, Haryana for first major BJP vs Congress showdown since Lok Sabha pollsTravis Kelce's Ex Kayla Nicole Delivers a Powerful 'Mental Health' Message While Facing Backlash from Taylor Swift Fans"Travis Kelce's career is over": Travis Kelce’s time in Kansas City may be numbered as the Chiefs decided to re-sign one of their familiar faces9 Powerful Quotes to Motivate Students Towards Success Through Hard WorkTop 10 Largest Economies In The World 2025: India To Become 4th Largest Economy Soon!

(Reuters Photo) WASHINGTON: Democrats face a test of unity in the US House of Representatives on Monday as they begin work on two ambitious spending plans that would devote trillions of dollars to transportation infrastructure and social programs.While centrist Democrats are eager to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that has already won approval in the Senate, liberals say they must prioritize a $3.5 trillion budget blueprint that would expand spending on child care and education.Both measures are priorities for Democratic President Joe Biden.The first test will come on Monday evening when the House is due to vote on a package that would advance both spending bills, as well as a separate voting rights proposal.That would clear the way for a final vote on the budget plan and the voting rights bill on Tuesday, but would not set a timeline for passage of the infrastructure bill.Nine moderates who are pushing the House to first pass the infrastructure bill have threatened to vote against the package. That could potentially scuttle it in the House, where Democrats hold a 220-212 majority."There is a standoff with some of our colleagues who have decided to hold the infrastructure bill hostage for months, or kill it altogether if they don’t get what they want in the next bill," they wrote in the Washington Post on Monday.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has sided with liberals who worry they might lose leverage on the social spending effort if they first pass the infrastructure bill. She wants the House to complete work on both bills by Oct. 1."Any delay to passing the budget resolution threatens the timetable for delivering the historic progress and the transformative vision that Democrats share," Pelosi wrote fellow Democrats on Saturday.No Republicans are expected to support the budget resolution plan, which sets the broad outline for spending on education, childcare, healthcare and climate measures favoured by Biden and pays for them with tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations.Crucially, the budget resolution plan would allow Democrats to pass those spending measures on a simple majority vote in the Senate, rather than the 60 votes required for most legislation in that chamber.The Senate is split 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats. Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris has the power, however, to cast the tie-breaking vote.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  Bigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial show​Bigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8​5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the worldFrom 'Bigg Boss' star to fitness icon: Shehnaaz Gill's inspiring weight loss journey10 most powerful countries in the world in 2024Universe Guidance For Each Zodiac SignTop 10 Largest Economies In The World 2025: India To Become 4th Largest Economy Soon!

(Reuters Photo)  WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden is brushing off criticism of his administration's chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal because he and his aides believe the political fallout at home will be limited, according to White House allies and administration officials.Biden and his top aides argue they are managing an evacuation mission https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/afghanistan-edge-after-anti-taliban-protest-east-kabul-calm-airlift-goes-2021-08-19 as well as could be expected given the faster-than-anticipated takeover of the country by the Taliban, and are seeking to draw attention back to the choice to get U.S.troops out of the country.The strategy is based on internal and public polling that shows the Afghanistan withdrawal had been by far the most popular decision Biden has made, even though the issue was not central for most voters."The public opinion is pretty damn clear that Americans wanted out of the ongoing war and don't want to get back in. It's true today and it's going to be true in six months," said one Biden ally. "It isn't about not caring or being empathetic about what's going on over there but worrying about what's happening in America."Biden has faced criticism even from some fellow Democrats for his handling of the crisis.But White House officials believe Americans' horror over graphic images https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/small-afghan-girl-is-lifted-crowd-capturing-desperation-flee-kabul-2021-08-19 of the chaos in Kabul and pleas from Afghans who fear they will be killed by the Taliban will morph into support for the president's decision to pull troops from the country by Aug. 31 after a 20-year war.They expect the Afghanistan story to recede from the headlines, replaced by the resurgence in COVID-19 cases, the economic recovery and other issues, people familiar with the matter said.A White House spokesperson declined to comment.Biden aides honed talking points weeks ago to be used even in the worst-case scenarios of a withdrawal, some of which have come to pass, including emphasizing that leaving Afghanistan was the right decision."The idea that somehow, there's a way to have gotten out without chaos ensuing, I don't know how that happens," Biden told ABC News on Wednesday. "There is no good time to leave Afghanistan. Fifteen years ago would've been a problem, 15 years from now. The basic choice is am I going to send your sons and your daughters to war in Afghanistan in perpetuity?"In recent days, Biden has also assailed the Afghan military for refusing to fight, denounced the now-ousted Afghan government and declared he inherited a bad withdrawal agreement from his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump.The strategy has obvious risks, political experts say. "The concern is that it's going to undercut his credibility as commander in chief," said Jim Manley, once a top aide to former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. "If the Taliban revert to what they've done in the past, and I assume that's going to be the case, it's going to be a lot of bad images coming out of that country."INADEQUATE RESPONSEThe Afghanistan messaging is increasingly at odds with an emerging consensus within the administration that the White House, Defense and State departments as well as the U.S. intelligence community's planning for the current situation was inadequate and needs to be fully reviewed once the mission of evacuating key people from Afghanistan is complete and the 5,200 U.S. troops now in Kabul are gone."We're at the Pentagon and even we know it could have been better," said one official. "A lot better." Members of the U.S. Congress also plan to investigate what went wrong.Public opinion, at least for now, is mixed. A majority of both Republican and Democratic voters say https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-approval-drops-lowest-level-this-year-after-taliban-takeover-2021-08-17 the swift capitulation of the Afghan government "is evidence why the U.S. should get out of the conflict."Reuters/Ipsos polling this week found that 31% of American adults agreed that the United States should continue its military operations in Afghanistan, up from the 25% who felt the same way in a 2012 poll.Yet Ipsos polling https://tmsnrt.rs/3k4cwxs conducted on Monday also showed fewer than half of Americans liked the way Biden had steered the U.S. military and diplomatic effort in Afghanistan this year. They currently rate his performance worse than the other three presidents who presided over the United States' longest war, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Trump.Biden's overall approval sank to 46% of American adults in Reuters/Ipsos polling, the lowest recorded in weekly polls since he took office in January.Republicans, including Trump, have started weaponizing the withdrawal as an issue to undermine faith in Biden as commander in chief.Most Democrats are likely to embrace public support of the withdrawal decision, and the issue should die down before the November 2022 congressional elections, said one adviser working on Democratic congressional campaigns.She added, however: "The Biden administration will likely have to defend every negative headline that comes out of Afghanistan during his tenure, so that is a real unknown."End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  From being 3 months pregnant while sitting on the hotseat to her son calling Amitabh Bachchan 'dadu'; Shruthy Daga opens up about her 'arranged marriage', KBC14 Journey and more9 morning habits that can bring down cholesterol levels within a monthLaughter Chefs: From Bharti Singh- Krushna Abhishek getting emotional to Nia Sharma getting teary eyed on missing Sudesh Lehri: Top moments from the recent episodeAstro-Numerology October 2024: Sanjay B Jumaani's Predictions for Each Number (1-9)5 traditional Indian hair oils for hair growth5 herbal drinks that help in reducing blood sugar levelsHappy Gandhi Jayanti 2024: Images, Wishes, Messages, Quotes, Pictures and Greeting CardsFrom Prince Narula - Yuvika Chaudhary to Keith Sequeira - Rochelle Maria Rao; Couples who found love in the Bigg Boss houseOptical illusion psychology test: What you see first reveals what you truly want in a relationship5 body language tips to appear more confidentWinter is coming: 5 places in India for a winter vacation in October5 signs of a master manipulator, as per psychology123Hot PicksIsrael Hezbollah War LiveOldest Miss UniverseErika Carr UtahPakistan Job CutsJ&K Phase 3 Elections LiveAir Canada FinedStock Market TodayTOP TRENDINGTimeless SkillHelicopter Crashes PuneIran Israel ConflictIND vs PAK T20 World CupBrittany MahomesMorne MorkelGaurav TanejaMichael VaughanRahul GandhiBrain Exercises to Boost MemoryTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website"Tears of Joy and Sorrow: Brittany Mahomes’ Heartfelt Reflection Amid Family Health Struggles"'Diddy List': Names of celebrities connected to Sean Combs viralHow tall is JD Vance?

The Daniel K Inouye Solar Telescope, at the summit of Haleakalā volcano on Maui, was supposed to open last fall. But Thomas Rimmele told Hawaii Public Radio on Wednesday that the Covid-19 travel restrictions set back construction on its critical systems.He hopes the current schedule won't be affected by newly surging coronavirus cases and any additional restrictions. Rimmele was expecting to return to Maui as early as this week. "November 15 is what we're shooting for. We just had a big review, the final construction review that was conducted by the National Science Foundation," Rimmele said. "(The scientists) are getting really anxious to get their observations and data done." The telescope has received about 100 proposals from researchers for an initial observing window of two-and-a-half months. Picking, which scientists get to go first, depends heavily on atmospheric conditions and what objects are visible on a given day.  He said one quarter or even a fifth of the proposals may be approved for the first cycle. "We are highly oversubscribed and people will have to submit proposals again for the next cycle," he said. "That's just how it works."The National Solar Observatory said the Inouye telescope will be able to reveal features three times smaller than anything scientists are able to see on the Sun currently. The Hawaii Supreme Court in 2016 affirmed a permit for the solar telescope's construction. The next year, more than 100 protesters tried to block a construction convoy heading to the telescope site, citing the sacredness of Haleakala's summit. Maui police had then arrested six people. Protests against another telescope planned for a different mountain and island -- the Thirty Meter Telescope at the summit of Mauna Kea on the Big Island -- have prevented construction crews from working on that project.

England's offer of a draw, while Sundar and Jadeja were nearing centuries, fueled their determination. India batters Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar refused to shake hands with England captain Ben Stokes. (Screengrab) Washington Sundar said the handshake drama on Day 5 of the Old Trafford Test fired up the Indian cricket team and brought the best out of him as well.England captain Ben Stokes offered a draw to Indian batters Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar at the drinks break in the final session of Day 5 in Manchester. At that time, both Jadeja and Washington were closing in on centuries — a first in Test cricket for the latter — and Stokes was furious that the two batters wanted to push on to their personal milestones.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"I mean, it just happens in any sport, doesn't it?" Washington told Wisden."We've seen a lot of such things happen, not just in cricket, but in any sport. I mean, that's how sport is. It brings out a lot. I think it was just an experience for all of us, honestly."Sundar admitted that the tension kind of fired him up."One hundred per cent," he said."You ask this to any player — that's exactly what you would hear. Especially in Test cricket, you want to be challenged because that's exactly what you expect every single day. And when the situation gets tough, the only thing that will help you get over it and come out successful is being really tough in your head."Every player who's played this format and been successful would have done this extremely well and over a long period of time, quite consistently as well," he said.Talking about the Oval Test win, he said: "It was fabulous."I mean, just the way the game turned out after every session was fabulous. Especially on Day 5, that 40 minutes was super intense because when you know the target has come down to single digits, you never know — anything could happen.

'I've lost Virat, Rohit, Dhoni's numbers': Ashwin shares 'scam' story
A man in Chhattisgarh unexpectedly received calls from cricket stars like Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers after purchasing a SIM card previously used by Rajat Patidar. This incident prompted Ravichandran Ashwin to share a story about a scammer impersonating Devon Conway, highlighting the importance of protecting personal information, especially for high-profile cricketers, in the digital age.

This incident prompted Ravichandran Ashwin to share a story about a scammer impersonating Devon Conway, highlighting the importance of protecting personal information, especially for high-profile cricketers, in the digital age. Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni (AFP Photo) NEW DELHI: A man from Madagaon village in Chhattisgarh’s Gariaband district had an unexpected brush with the cricketing world after buying a SIM card that once belonged to Royal Challengers Bengaluru captain Rajat Patidar. The purchase led to surprise calls from stars like Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers.Manish Bisi and his friend Khemraj first grew suspicious when, upon installing WhatsApp on the newly bought SIM from a local shop, they saw Patidar’s profile picture.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Their curiosity turned to disbelief as they began receiving calls from cricket celebrities including Kohli, de Villiers, and Yash Dayal. At first, they assumed it was a prank by friends — until Patidar himself called on July 15, asking for the SIM card’s return.The incident prompted Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin — who retired from international cricket last year but continues in the IPL — to recall a similar situation in which he nearly fell victim to a scammer impersonating his Chennai Super Kings teammate Devon Conway."After the IPL got over, one guy messaged me, claiming to be Devon Conway, 'Hi buddy, how are you?' and I also responded, 'We'll stay in touch. You're playing in MLC; I'll watch the games.' He then asked, 'I've lost Virat Kohli's number, can you share it?' I thought, why is he asking for Virat's number? I thought I should ask him, but I didn't want Devon Conway to misunderstand. Then I picked Virat Kohli's card and gave him a different number," Ashwin revealed on his YouTube channel."Once I shared it, he replied, 'I've lost a few more numbers.' I asked whose numbers, and he responded, 'Rohit Sharma and MS Dhoni.' I got suspicious and thought somebody was playing a prank. I then asked him a question, 'I gave you a bat this year, how's that bat?' He said the bat is amazing, but I hadn't even given him any bat. He lied, and I blocked him instantly. The guy took a chance. I went back to the CSK group and checked Devon Conway's number, and it was not the same. At least I had the smarts to send the duplicate card of Virat. It was his WhatsApp number in Australia. Thank goodness, because he was asking for everybody's numbers."These incidents serve as a reminder of the growing need to protect personal information in the digital era, especially for high-profile cricketers.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

NEW DELHI: The 2025 Asia Cup will be played in the UAE from September 9 to 28, the Asian Cricket Council confirmed earlier this month, ending weeks of uncertainty over India’s participation. Doubts arose after India–Pakistan relations hit a fresh low, triggering calls to boycott Pakistan at global sporting events.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Silence from the BCCI kept broadcasters, sponsors, and fans on edge before the board finally confirmed that the defending champions will compete. When India skipped the Asia CupIndia’s absence from the 1986 Asia Cup remains the only time the Men in Blue have missed the continental tournament. The decision came just two years after they lifted the trophy in the inaugural 1984 edition.That year’s event was scheduled in Sri Lanka but was overshadowed by the country’s escalating civil war, which had broken out in 1983 between the government and the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Concerned for player safety, the Indian government instructed the BCCI to withdraw the team, making it a politically sensitive move given India’s delicate regional diplomacy over the conflict.The pull-out left only three participants — Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Bangladesh — with the hosts eventually lifting the trophy. The 1986 decision remains a rare example of India skipping a major multi-nation cricket event, underscoring the priority given to national security over sporting obligations.2025 Asia Cup edition at a neutral venueThe upcoming Asia Cup will follow the T20I format and feature eight teams: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, UAE, Oman, and Hong Kong. India is in Group A with Pakistan, UAE, and Oman, while Group B includes Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Hong Kong. Although India is the formal host, a neutral venue arrangement with the PCB ensures that Indo-Pak fixtures over the next three years are staged at third-party venues.Dubai will host 11 matches, including India’s opener against the UAE on September 10 and the high-profile clash with Pakistan on September 14. Abu Dhabi will stage eight games, including India’s final group match against Oman on September 19. The Super 4 stage runs from September 20 to 26, with the final set for September 28 in Dubai.If both sides progress, India and Pakistan could face each other up to three times — in the group stage, the Super 4, and potentially in the title clash — ensuring the cricketing rivalry stays in sharp focus despite the political tensions surrounding it.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Hum unko itni importance kyun dete hain? [Why do we give them so much importance?]," legendary spinner Harbhajan Singh didn’t mince words when asked if India should boycott Pakistan in the upcoming Asia Cup, scheduled to be held in the UAE from September 9.Harbhajan was part of the recently concluded World Championship of Legends (WCL), where India Champions refused to play Pakistan Champions in the group stage and the semi-final. The squad — featuring stalwarts like Shikhar Dhawan, Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan, Irfan Pathan, Suresh Raina, and Yusuf Pathan — took this stand in the wake of the gruesome Pahalgam terror attack.Explained: Why The India-Pakistan Asia Cup Clash Cannot Be Cancelled Despite BacklashGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!For Harbhajan, “nation comes first,” and he believes the Suryakumar Yadav-led Indian team should refuse to play the neighbours."They need to understand what is important and what is not. This is as simple as that. For me, humare desh ka wo jawan jo sarhad par khada hua hai, unki families jo kayi baar unko nahi dekh paati hain, unki shahadat ho jaati hai, wo ghar wapas nahi laut paate hain — unki itni badi sacrifice hoti hai hum sabke liye. Toh ye to bahut chhoti si baat hai ki hum ek cricket match na chhod sakein [For me, the soldier who stands on the border, whose family often doesn’t get to see him, who sometimes sacrifices his life and never returns home — their sacrifice is so immense for all of us. Compared to that, this is a very small thing — that we can’t even skip playing one cricket match. It’s a very small matter]," Harbhajan told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.India are placed alongside Oman, hosts United Arab Emirates, and Pakistan in Group A. Group B, meanwhile, comprises of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, and Sri Lanka.It cannot be the case that there’s fighting on the border, tensions between the two nations, and we go to play cricket. Until these big issues are resolved, cricket is a very small matterHarbhajan Singh"Our government has the same stance, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte.' (blood and sweat cannot co-exist). It cannot be the case that there’s fighting on the border, tensions between the two nations, and we go to play cricket. Until these big issues are resolved, cricket is a very small matter. The nation always comes first," Harbhajan said."Whatever our identity is, it’s because of this country. Whether you are a player, an actor, or anyone else — no one is bigger than the nation. The country comes first, and the duties we owe to it must be fulfilled. Cricket match na khelna bahut maamuli si cheez hai desh ke saamne [Not playing a cricket match is nothing compared to the importance of the nation]," the former spinner said."Humare sarhad pe bhai khade hue hain, jo hume protect kar rahe hain, humare desh ko protect kar rahe hain — unke hausle dekho, wo kitna bada dil leke waha pe khade hue hain. Aur unke parivaar par kya beetati hai jab wo ghar wapas nahi aate. Aur hum cricket khelne chale jaate hain [At the border, our brothers are standing, protecting us and our country. Look at their courage, the big hearts with which they serve. Think about what their families go through when they don’t return home. And here we are, playing cricket]," he said.PollShould India boycott Pakistan in the upcoming Asia Cup?Yes, for the sake of national integrityNo, sports should be separate from politicsOnly if the government decidesUnsure"Hum unko itni importance kyun dete hain? Are they that important? Are they that important ki har news channel unko chalaye? When you have boycotted them, when you don't want to talk to them, then why show them here? This is the duty of the media — to stop this. They shouldn't be adding fuel to the fire."As I said, cricketers shouldn't be shaking hands with the Pakistan players, but the media shouldn't be showing them and their reactions on television, either. They are sitting in their country and can say whatever they want, but we shouldn’t be highlighting them," he said.India are the defending Asia Cup champions. They defeated Sri Lanka by 10 wickets to clinch their eighth title — the most by any country in the competition's history.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

The incident occurred in the 17th over of Australia’s innings when Bosch, after dismissing Ben Dwarshuis, made a gesture towards the opposition dugout in what officials deemed a provocative send-off.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! According to the ICC, Bosch was found guilty of breaching Article 2.5 of the Code, which covers “using language, actions or gestures which disparage or which could provoke an aggressive reaction from a batter upon his/her dismissal during an International Match.” As a result, one demerit point has been added to Bosch’s disciplinary record. He accepted the sanction proposed by the ICC Match Officials, meaning no formal hearing was required. The match itself was a high-scoring affair, with South Africa looking to level the three-match series after losing the opener. Dewald Brevis stole the show with a remarkable 125 not out from 56 balls, guiding the visitors to 218/7. His hundred came in just 41 balls, making him the youngest Men’s T20I centurion for South Africa and registering the second-fastest T20I ton for the Proteas. Australia’s chase was led by Tim David, who hit a brisk half-century off 24 balls. However, the hosts were bowled out for 165, with Bosch and Kwena Maphaka both taking three wickets each to seal a 53-run victory for South Africa.PollDo you think Corbin Bosch deserved the penalty for his gesture towards the dugout?Yes, it was unsportsmanlikeNo, it was just a competitive reaction The series now stands at 1-1, with the decider scheduled for Saturday, 16 August, in Cairns. The ODI series between the two sides begins on 19 August.In the same game, Bosch was left frustrated when a delivery to Mitchell Owen grazed the stump, but the bail failed to come off.

Lucknow: Lucknow Super Giants' captain Rishabh Pant with team mentor Zaheer Khan during a practice session ahead of the IPL 2025 cricket match between Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Lucknow Super Giants, in Lucknow. (PTI Photo/Kamal Kishore) New Delhi: Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) are likely to part ways with mentor Zaheer Khan ahead of the next Indian Premier League (IPL) season in 2026, TimesofIndia.com has learnt. "LSG is set to part ways with Zaheer Khan and the new mentor will be given a bigger role to monitor RPSG Group's other franchises," a source tracking the development confirmed to TimesofIndia.com.It is also learnt that LSG's owner Sanjiv Goenka, who is currently in the UK for The Hundred, will announce a Director of Cricket, who will oversee the year-round development of LSG's other franchises -- Durban's Super Giants in the SA20 and Manchester Originals in The Hundred.IPL 2025: What went wrong for Lucknow Super Giants?Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Zaheer had stepped into the mentor role as a replacement for Gautam Gambhir who stepped down after IPL 2023. The former India seamer was also fulfilling the bowling coach duties since Morne Morkel's exit, who left his role to work alongside Gambhir and the India men's cricket team.Between 2018 and 2022, Zaheer was associated with the Mumbai Indians (MI) franchise, initially serving as Director of Cricket before taking on the job of head of global development.PollShould LSG part ways with Zaheer Khan as their mentor?Yes, it's time for a changeNo, he should stayA couple of weeks ago, LSG had roped in Bharat Arun as their new bowling coach. "Arun's role is also extensive as he will be given an extra responsibility for scouting and working on their young quicks for Durban's Super Giants and, from next year, with the Manchester Originals as well," the source said.Under Rishabh Pant's leadership, LSG had a largely forgettable IPL 2025 season with flashes of brilliance but consistency being a challenge. Work to arrest that problematic run has already begun with Bharat Arun first and Zaheer Khan now."It's an honour to join the Lucknow Super Giants, a franchise that reflects professionalism, ambition, and vision at every level," Arun said in a statement. "My conversations with Dr. Sanjiv Goenka and the management were incredibly energizing -- there is a clear intent to invest in young Indian talent and build a long-term legacy."What excites me most is the vision for long-term development. LSG has invested in a young, talented, and dynamic group of Indian fast bowlers -- Akash Deep, Avesh Khan, Mayank Yadav, Prince Yadav, Mohsin Khan, and Akash Singh -- and I see immense potential in each of them.

'Babar should never have been compared to Kohli' – Former Pakistan cricketer
Ahmed Shehzad has criticized the comparisons between Babar Azam and Virat Kohli, stating they create undue pressure affecting Babar's performance. Shehzad emphasized Kohli's legendary status, unmatched even by MS Dhoni as a batter and athlete. Babar has now gone 72 consecutive international innings without scoring a century, with his last hundred coming against Nepal.

Shehzad emphasized Kohli's legendary status, unmatched even by MS Dhoni as a batter and athlete. Babar has now gone 72 consecutive international innings without scoring a century, with his last hundred coming against Nepal. Virat Kohli and Babar Azam Former Pakistan batter Ahmed Shehzad has come out strongly against the trend of comparing players, particularly Babar Azam, with modern-day great Virat Kohli. Speaking in an interview, Shehzad said that such comparisons are not only unfair but also add unnecessary pressure on players, which is visible in Babar’s current struggles. “When everything was going well, you were running campaigns comparing players. Now that the performances are not coming, you are saying ‘don’t compare two players’. Why not? Virat Kohli’s comparison cannot be made with anyone in the world. He is a legend of this generation, a role model. You cannot compare him even with MS Dhoni. Dhoni may have been a great captain, but as a batter, cricketer, and athlete, Kohli stands alone. No one should be compared with anyone because it’s unfair and it adds extra pressure, which we are now seeing on Babar Azam,” Shehzad said.Explained: Why The India-Pakistan Asia Cup Clash Cannot Be Cancelled Despite BacklashGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Babar’s dip in form has been a talking point for months. He has now gone 72 consecutive international innings without scoring a century, with his last hundred coming against Nepal. Since 2023, no other cricketer has endured a longer drought without a century. Adding to that, since 2024, Babar and Mohammad Rizwan are the only two batters from full-member nations with a strike rate below 80. The struggles have coincided with a change in leadership. Babar is no longer Pakistan’s captain across formats, having stepped down earlier this year following criticism over results and his own performances. The recent ODI series against West Indies only intensified the scrutiny, as Pakistan suffered a 202-run loss to concede their first bilateral ODI series to the Caribbean side in 34 years.PollShould players be compared to legends like Virat Kohli?Yes, it motivates themNo, it adds unnecessary pressureShehzad’s remarks highlight the pressure top players face when placed on the same pedestal as legends, and why the weight of public comparisons can often prove damaging to form and confidence.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

He highlighted the Ashes series' significance and profitability, contrasting it with less competitive series involving the West Indies and Zimbabwe. Greenberg also mentioned considering future formats to maintain competitiveness. India won the fifth and final Test vs England at The Oval (Getty Images)  Australia cricket chief Todd Greenberg on Wednesday said a reduced Test calendar could help smaller nations, as the five-day format thrived most “where it means something.” With 100 days to go until the home Ashes series against England begins in Perth, the Cricket Australia CEO stressed that quality, not quantity, was key to keeping red-ball cricket strong."We're trying to send countries bankrupt if we force them to try to play Test cricket," he told reporters.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

India's Akash Deep celebrates after scoring fifty runs (AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) Indian pacer Akash Deep describes his first tour of England as smoother than he had imagined, thanks to a coach who believed in him, a supportive captain, and conditions that felt familiar rather than challenging. He shared his thoughts in an interview with PTI. His maiden tour saw him claim a 10-wicket haul in one Test and play a crucial 66 at the Oval in another, both contributing to India’s wins. Reflecting on the performance, Akash recalled what head coach Gautam Gambhir told him after his innings at the Oval. “You aren’t aware of your capabilities. I was telling you, you can do it. You have to play with this dedication always,” the 29-year-old shared.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Akash spoke highly of Gambhir’s support, saying the coach believes in him more than he believes in himself, both with the ball and the bat. Adjusting to new leadership has been easy for Akash, who made his Test debut under Rohit Sharma and now plays under Shubman Gill. He praised the calmness and on-field intelligence of the new captain. Playing in England, Akash Deep found the conditions surprisingly familiar. Most matches had little seam or swing movement, which required him to adjust lengths similar to sub-continental wickets. He emphasised that experience and proper practice allowed him to adapt quickly.Gautam Gambhir's fiery press conferences: Every time the India head coach lost his cool The Bengal pacer also highlighted his net routines and visualisation techniques, focusing on key opposition batters even while bowling to teammates during practice sessions. On concerns about injuries after missing games in Australia and England, he stated that impact injuries are unavoidable on the field but training injuries are minimised as much as possible. Akash has played 10 Tests, taking 28 wickets. He said selectors have not restricted him to a particular format and that he focuses on being ready for any call-up.PollWhich achievement of Akash Deep do you think stands out the most?10-wicket haul in a Test66 runs at the OvalBefore the England tour, his sister Akhanda Jyoti was diagnosed with cancer, which was an emotionally challenging time for the family. He recalled how good performances lifted her spirits and helped the family stay positive. After returning to India, Akash treated himself to his dream luxury SUV. Reflecting on his journey from playing tennis-ball cricket in Durgapur to becoming an international star, he said he has always focused on improving daily and living in the present. “The heart of my life is cricket.

The delivering dealership faces suspension for releasing the vehicle without mandatory plates, prompting RTO to issue directives ensuring HSRP and TRM installations before vehicle delivery. Akash Deep with his family while picking up his 'dream car'. (Image: Instagram) The Regional Transport Office (RTO) in Lucknow issued a notice on Monday (August 11) to cricketer Akash Deep, directing him to cease using his newly purchased SUV on public roads due to incomplete registration formalities and missing mandatory high-security registration plate (HSRP) and third registration mark (TRM). The notice gives the cricketer 72 hours to comply with all vehicle documentation requirements and appear before authorities.The vehicle was purchased on August 7, with insurance obtained on August 8, and received a fancy registration number (UP32 QW 0041) on August 9. However, the RTO discovered that the temporary registration and registration certificate process remained incomplete on the Vahan portal.Akash Deep press conference: On replacing Jasprit Bumrah, message from Gautam Gambhir and moreThe authorities found that the vehicle lacked the mandatory HSRP and TRM installations, which violates sections 39 and 41(6) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and Rule 50 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989."The notice warns that driving the vehicle in its current state constitutes an offence under Section 192 of the MVA and empowers authorities to seize or detain the vehicle under Section 207."The RTO has instructed Akash Deep to appear either personally or through an authorised representative within the specified timeframe, bringing all necessary documentation including proof of registration, insurance, and tax payment records.The Chinhat-based automobile dealership that delivered the vehicle to Akash Deep without the required HSRP and TRM also received a show-cause notice from the RTO. "Legal action under Sections 192 and 207 of the Motor Vehicles Act will be initiated against the defaulting dealer."The incident prompted the RTO to issue comprehensive instructions to all dealers in the region. These directives emphasise that no vehicle, regardless of temporary or permanent registration status, can be delivered to customers without HSRP and TRM installations.The dealers must ensure compliance with Form 20, 21, and 22 requirements before vehicle delivery. Additionally, they are required to update all relevant records on the Vahan portal prior to releasing vehicles to customers.“Dream delivered. Keys received. With the ones who matter most,” Akash Deep had posted on Instagram, sharing pictures of the car alongside his family.Akash Deep's purchase had come just a week after the end of the India tour of England, which finished 2-2. Akash Deep played three of five matches, taking 13 wickets. His best showing came at Edgbaston, where he took 10 wickets.What is a High Security Registration Plate (HSRP)?Contrary to standard number plates of cars which can suffer damage easily, High Security Registration Plates (HSRP) were introduced to protect it from happening.HSRPs are number plates that come with multiple security features like laser codes, non-removable screws, and a hologram, making them challenging to be stolen or faked.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Shane Warne for Australia in 2005 (Image via Getty Images) Australian leg-spinner Alana King recalled a special childhood memory of meeting her idol, the late Shane Warne, and how his simple words have stayed with her throughout her cricketing journey. King, who represents Australia internationally and plays domestic cricket for Western Australia and Perth Scorchers, first met Warne when she was about 12 years old during a school or holiday coaching clinic. Surrounded by other kids, she received a piece of advice that has guided her career ever since.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! “I met Warnie (Shane Warne) when I was about 12 years old, along with a lot of other kids who were there for a school clinic or a school holiday clinic. All I remember — and these words still echo in my career today — is, ‘Spin the ball as hard as you can and do it with a big smile on your face,’” King said in a BBC Sport video . Though her interaction with Warne was brief, the spinner admitted she had always wished for more opportunities to work with him as her career progressed. “That’s pretty much the only advice he ever gave me. I would have loved to work with Warnie as my career progressed, but it was not to be,” she added.PollWhat aspect of Shane Warne's influence do you find most significant?Technical skills in bowlingJoy and passion for the gameHis personality and charisma Instead, King drew inspiration from studying Warne’s style. She spent hours watching old footage and listening to his commentary. “Still, I’ve watched so many tapes and clips of him bowling, and I used to love listening to him in the commentary box,” she said. “I learned a lot just from hearing him speak. I didn’t even have to be in his presence for him to have a big influence on my career.” Warne, who passed away on March 4, 2022, is widely regarded as one of the greatest bowlers in cricket history, redefining leg-spin with his skill, accuracy, and tactical acumen. For King, his influence was not just in the technical aspects of bowling, but also in the joy and passion he brought to the game. His words from that clinic, urging her to spin the ball hard and smile while doing it, remain a guiding principle for her every time she takes the field, now at the age of 29.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

However, his form appeared to decline in subsequent matches, where he managed to take only three wickets. During the Oval Test, there were indications of potential fitness issues when teammate Gill was overheard asking about his injection. Despite his bowling struggles, Akash Deep contributed significantly with the bat at the Oval, scoring 66 runs as a nightwatchman, which helped India secure another victory in the series.PollHow do you rate the East Zone squad for the Duleep Trophy?ExcellentGoodAverage The East Zone team, set to be captained by Ishan Kishan with Abhimanyu Easwaran as vice-captain, includes players like Riyan Parag, Mohammed Shami, and Mukesh Kumar.

Gill's past IPL performance and leadership potential are weighed against the settled T20 team under Suryakumar Yadav. Selectors must decide how to accommodate Gill and Jaiswal, while also considering future captaincy options. Abhishek Sharma, Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal New Delhi: Weeks before the team for the T20 World Cup was picked in 2024, Shubman Gill had given a mild reminder to the selectors. “If they want to ignore 800-plus runs in the IPL, then good luck to them,” Gill had said, referring to his 890-run IPL season in 2023. Gill eventually missed out on India’s victorious campaign. The selectors are due to sit in the next fortnight to pick the T20 team for the upcoming Asia Cup to be played in UAE in Sept. With Suryakumar Yadav in charge of the team, Gill’s role will be up for debate. More than the Asia Cup, the selectors will be laying down a broader roadmap for India’s T20 cricket — with an eye on the T20 World Cup at home in Feb-March and beyond.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! One must remember Gill is the incumbent ODI vice-captain. He was also given T20I vice-captaincy in the T20I series in Sri Lanka immediately after the T20 World Cup. It has been a heady few months in Indian cricket. Gill’s ascension as India’s premier batter has coincided with a stunning revival of the team’s Test performance in England. Yet, Indian cricket is still torn between specialists vs all-format players when it comes to the T20 team. Even in the lead-up to the T20 World Cup last year, there was a strong undercurrent against having veterans Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja. It reached to a stage where it was a given that the trio would retire from the format after the tournament. It was all based on statistical evidence: India were playing outdated T20 cricket compared to England, Australia, West Indies and even South Africa. Gautam Gambhir, when he assumed the role of India’s head coach, has emphasised on having a niche T20 team giving credence to IPL performers. Here’s the challenge for the selectors now. Over the last year, India’s T20 cricket under Suryakumar has been refreshing. If one goes by the performances of the three series he has led in since Oct, India look to have a settled team which is playing uninhibited cricket. But then, there has been no Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sai Sudharsan in Surya’s team yet. Gill, Jaiswal and even Jasprit Bumrah were conserved for the heavy Test calendar that culminated in a thrilling series in England this month. The debate that will dominate the selection meeting would be around how the selectors accommodate Gill and Jaiswal. The selection committee has maintained that the players who were picked around the last T20 World Cup should always be given preference since they missed out on the format because of their Test commitments. Indian cricket has usually leaned towards captains across formats who can cater to the market forces and bring substantial brand value. That Gill has become a major brand can’t be ignored.PollShould Shubman Gill be included in the T20 squad for the Asia Cup?Yes, he deserves a spotNo, stick with the current team Former India selector Devang Gandhi, who oversaw Virat Kohli’s transition into an all-format captain, believes handing Gill the vice-captaincy is a no-brainer. “Gill has built the aura similar to what Virat had in 2017. Virat was groomed under MS Dhoni. Gill is also at his peak like Virat was. He too has reacted to captaincy as well as Virat did. Ajit Agarkar has shown great foresight by appointing Gill as Test captain. There’s no reason why he should not Gill a leadership role in T20. The messaging has to be clear about who takes over after Surya,” Gandhi told TOI. “Unlike other countries, split captaincy doesn’t work in India in the long run because you crave stability in the thought process. When you have a prolific all-format player leading in one format, it becomes difficult to not hand him the same responsibility in the other format. Gill has ticked all the boxes as a batter. And he has led in IPL,” Gandhi reasoned. When the knives were out against Kohli, Rohit, Jadeja and KL Rahul, strike-rate had become the moot point. Gill is seen as a player who is in the mould of Kohli and Rahul — relying on conventional cricket to score his runs in T20s. Gill’s IPL strike-rate has been around 150, if not more, in the last three IPL seasons where he has scored over 2000 runs. His T20I strike rate is pushing 140. One must also recognise that Jaiswal was ahead in the race till the heavy Test season arrived last year. Jaiswal has scored 773 T20I runs at a strike rate of 164 and an average of 36. Former India wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta, who has been following Indian cricket closely as a broadcaster, says Gill has to be in the starting XI. For him, the wicketkeeper has to be a flexible batter in the middle order. “Sanju Samson has done well. But he struggled against a full strength England team at home. That was the only series under Surya where India played a top international full-strength team. Gill can play the role of Kohli who can take the innings deep in high-pressure tournaments. He has IPL performances to back him. On slower pitches in UAE, one must have that kind of player. Going by how Agarkar’s panel has worked, the planning will be beyond the Asia Cup. If they need to groom a captain for the future, they will have to decide if Axar Patel is above Gill,” Dasgupta told TOI. “Abhishek Sharma has to start as the opener because he can kill a game when he gets going. But it’s imperative that Jaiswal is in and around the squad. So, the team management has to decide if Samson or Jitesh Sharma can serve in the middle-order,” he added. No place for Siraj in the settled bowling attack? The selectors will not have to spend much time over picking the bowling attack. Bumrah is all but certain to play most of the T20Is leading to the T20 World Cup with Arshdeep Singh and Hardik Pandya. For all his stellar show in the Test series in England, Siraj doesn’t look like finding a place in the T20I side right now. He lost his place in white-ball cricket since the 2024 T20 World Cup. The selectors may pick an additional pacer like Harshit Rana or Avesh Khan. The spin attack looks well-rounded with Varun Chakravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar and Washington Sundar.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Suresh Raina (Image credit: Instagram) Former India cricketer Suresh Raina is set to face questioning by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday morning regarding a money laundering case connected to illegal online betting platform 1XBet, where the agency suspects his involvement through endorsements.The ED plans to record Raina's statements under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) during his deposition.Suresh Raina announces retirement from all formats of cricketGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!The agency's investigation focuses on understanding Raina's alleged connections to the betting app through certain endorsements."These platforms are in violation of multiple laws and directions by the Indian government... It is estimated that around 22 crore (220 million) Indian users are currently engaged on various betting apps, and 11 crore (110 million) of these are regular users," an official told the Hindustan Times.Reports indicate that illegal betting websites and apps recorded over 1.6 billion visits in the first three months of 2025. The online betting market in India is estimated to be worth around $100 million, with illegal betting apps allegedly evading tax worth Rs 27,000 crore annually.The ED had previously attached assets worth 337 crore in cases related to IPL cricket match betting last year.One significant case involves the online platform Fairplay, whose directors face accusations of illegal IPL cricket match broadcasting and online betting activities."The attached assets include demat account holdings, lands, flats and commercial warehouses located at Ajmer (Rajasthan), Kutch (Gujarat), Daman, Thane & Mumbai (Maharashtra) are worth 219.66cr of the online betting app Fairplay and its promoters," the ED stated.What is PMLA?India's Parliament introduced the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in 2002 to fight financial crimes. This law helps catch people who try to make illegal money look legal. It gives authorities power to seize dirty money, requires banks to report suspicious activities, and punishes wrongdoers.The PMLA serves as India's main weapon against money laundering. It protects the country's financial system from criminals who try to hide their illegal earnings. The law works by stopping bad actors from converting their unlawful gains into legitimate assets.Key objectives of PMLAUnder this law, government agencies can take away property bought with dirty money. The Directorate of Enforcement leads investigations into these crimes. They can freeze assets linked to money laundering cases.The law puts strict rules on banks and financial companies. They must carefully check who their customers are. They need to keep detailed records of transactions. If they spot anything suspicious, they must tell the Financial Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-IND) right away.These measures help catch criminals who try to clean their illegal money through the banking system. The law makes sure that people can't easily hide their ill-gotten wealth by moving it through different accounts or buying expensive things.The PMLA shows India's strong commitment to keeping its financial system clean. It helps stop criminals from using banks and other institutions to make their illegal money look legitimate.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

'I've lost Virat, Rohit, Dhoni's numbers': Ashwin shares 'scam' story
A man in Chhattisgarh unexpectedly received calls from cricket stars like Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers after purchasing a SIM card previously used by Rajat Patidar.

This incident prompted Ravichandran Ashwin to share a story about a scammer impersonating Devon Conway, highlighting the importance of protecting personal information, especially for high-profile cricketers, in the digital age. Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni (AFP Photo) NEW DELHI: A man from Madagaon village in Chhattisgarh’s Gariaband district had an unexpected brush with the cricketing world after buying a SIM card that once belonged to Royal Challengers Bengaluru captain Rajat Patidar. The purchase led to surprise calls from stars like Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers.Manish Bisi and his friend Khemraj first grew suspicious when, upon installing WhatsApp on the newly bought SIM from a local shop, they saw Patidar’s profile picture.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Their curiosity turned to disbelief as they began receiving calls from cricket celebrities including Kohli, de Villiers, and Yash Dayal. At first, they assumed it was a prank by friends — until Patidar himself called on July 15, asking for the SIM card’s return.The incident prompted Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin — who retired from international cricket last year but continues in the IPL — to recall a similar situation in which he nearly fell victim to a scammer impersonating his Chennai Super Kings teammate Devon Conway."After the IPL got over, one guy messaged me, claiming to be Devon Conway, 'Hi buddy, how are you?' and I also responded, 'We'll stay in touch. You're playing in MLC; I'll watch the games.' He then asked, 'I've lost Virat Kohli's number, can you share it?' I thought, why is he asking for Virat's number? I thought I should ask him, but I didn't want Devon Conway to misunderstand. Then I picked Virat Kohli's card and gave him a different number," Ashwin revealed on his YouTube channel."Once I shared it, he replied, 'I've lost a few more numbers.' I asked whose numbers, and he responded, 'Rohit Sharma and MS Dhoni.' I got suspicious and thought somebody was playing a prank. I then asked him a question, 'I gave you a bat this year, how's that bat?' He said the bat is amazing, but I hadn't even given him any bat. He lied, and I blocked him instantly. The guy took a chance. I went back to the CSK group and checked Devon Conway's number, and it was not the same. At least I had the smarts to send the duplicate card of Virat. It was his WhatsApp number in Australia. Thank goodness, because he was asking for everybody's numbers."These incidents serve as a reminder of the growing need to protect personal information in the digital era, especially for high-profile cricketers.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

The bill establishes the National Sports Board and Tribunal, aiming for enhanced accountability. It grants the government power to restrict international participation in extraordinary circumstances, citing national security or global emergencies. India vs Pakistan (File Photo) NEW DELHI: India’s landmark National Sports Governance Bill, passed smoothly in Parliament, will be implemented within the next six months, with “drafting of rules and identification of infrastructure” already underway, Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya has said.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!“This bill will be implemented as soon as possible. Within the next six months, all procedures will be completed to ensure 100 per cent implementation,” Mandaviya told PTI in his first interview after the legislation cleared both Houses. Calling it “the single biggest reform in sports since independence”, he said the aim was to ensure the new National Sports Board (NSB) and National Sports Tribunal (NST) are “fully functional at the earliest possible date consistent with statutory and procedural requirements.”Explained: Why The India-Pakistan Asia Cup Clash Cannot Be Cancelled Despite BacklashA key provision of the bill gives the government discretionary power to “impose reasonable restrictions” on international participation of Indian teams and athletes under “extraordinary circumstances”.“The provision empowering the government to stop international participation is a standard safeguard seen in sports laws globally, intended for use in extraordinary circumstances,” Mandaviya said. “It covers situations such as national security threats, diplomatic boycotts, or global emergencies, and is not directed against any particular country.”He cited cricketing precedent to underline the policy’s real-world context: “...full senior men’s cricket tours to Pakistan have not taken place since the 2008 Mumbai attacks, and high-profile matches have often been moved to neutral venues. Such decisions are taken on a case-by-case basis in consultation with the Ministry of External Affairs and security agencies.”“This reflects the Modi government’s clarity in protecting national interest while upholding global sporting obligations,” he added.Mandaviya said the challenges in bringing the bill to life included over 350 ongoing sports-related court cases, balancing Olympic Charter autonomy with accountability, and the varied professionalism across federations. Consensus came after “more than 60 rounds of structured discussions” with state ministers, NSFs, athletes, and coaches.“I gave an entire day to NSF representatives, an entire day to athletes, coaches. I gave presentations to explain each and every clause of the bill. I explained to them why I think the clauses were needed. I did not impose, I asked for their feedback,” he said, adding that he even went through “each and every one of the 600 public suggestions.”Former sports minister Ajai Maken, who drafted an earlier version in 2011, was also consulted. “In 2013, honourable Ajay Maken ji brought this bill to the cabinet but it could not be passed... vested interests within NSFs... were against coming under any kind of governance scrutiny,” Mandaviya said.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

India will play Pakistan in a high-profile match on September 14, with potential for multiple encounters throughout the tournament.  NEW DELHI: The 2025 Asia Cup will be played in the UAE from September 9 to 28, the Asian Cricket Council confirmed earlier this month, ending weeks of uncertainty over India’s participation. Doubts arose after India–Pakistan relations hit a fresh low, triggering calls to boycott Pakistan at global sporting events.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Silence from the BCCI kept broadcasters, sponsors, and fans on edge before the board finally confirmed that the defending champions will compete. When India skipped the Asia CupIndia’s absence from the 1986 Asia Cup remains the only time the Men in Blue have missed the continental tournament. The decision came just two years after they lifted the trophy in the inaugural 1984 edition.That year’s event was scheduled in Sri Lanka but was overshadowed by the country’s escalating civil war, which had broken out in 1983 between the government and the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Concerned for player safety, the Indian government instructed the BCCI to withdraw the team, making it a politically sensitive move given India’s delicate regional diplomacy over the conflict.The pull-out left only three participants — Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Bangladesh — with the hosts eventually lifting the trophy. The 1986 decision remains a rare example of India skipping a major multi-nation cricket event, underscoring the priority given to national security over sporting obligations.2025 Asia Cup edition at a neutral venueThe upcoming Asia Cup will follow the T20I format and feature eight teams: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, UAE, Oman, and Hong Kong. India is in Group A with Pakistan, UAE, and Oman, while Group B includes Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Hong Kong. Although India is the formal host, a neutral venue arrangement with the PCB ensures that Indo-Pak fixtures over the next three years are staged at third-party venues.Dubai will host 11 matches, including India’s opener against the UAE on September 10 and the high-profile clash with Pakistan on September 14. Abu Dhabi will stage eight games, including India’s final group match against Oman on September 19. The Super 4 stage runs from September 20 to 26, with the final set for September 28 in Dubai.If both sides progress, India and Pakistan could face each other up to three times — in the group stage, the Super 4, and potentially in the title clash — ensuring the cricketing rivalry stays in sharp focus despite the political tensions surrounding it.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

(PTI Photo/Kamal Kishore) New Delhi: Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) are likely to part ways with mentor Zaheer Khan ahead of the next Indian Premier League (IPL) season in 2026, TimesofIndia.com has learnt. "LSG is set to part ways with Zaheer Khan and the new mentor will be given a bigger role to monitor RPSG Group's other franchises," a source tracking the development confirmed to TimesofIndia.com.It is also learnt that LSG's owner Sanjiv Goenka, who is currently in the UK for The Hundred, will announce a Director of Cricket, who will oversee the year-round development of LSG's other franchises -- Durban's Super Giants in the SA20 and Manchester Originals in The Hundred.IPL 2025: What went wrong for Lucknow Super Giants?Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Zaheer had stepped into the mentor role as a replacement for Gautam Gambhir who stepped down after IPL 2023. The former India seamer was also fulfilling the bowling coach duties since Morne Morkel's exit, who left his role to work alongside Gambhir and the India men's cricket team.Between 2018 and 2022, Zaheer was associated with the Mumbai Indians (MI) franchise, initially serving as Director of Cricket before taking on the job of head of global development.PollShould LSG part ways with Zaheer Khan as their mentor?Yes, it's time for a changeNo, he should stayA couple of weeks ago, LSG had roped in Bharat Arun as their new bowling coach. "Arun's role is also extensive as he will be given an extra responsibility for scouting and working on their young quicks for Durban's Super Giants and, from next year, with the Manchester Originals as well," the source said.Under Rishabh Pant's leadership, LSG had a largely forgettable IPL 2025 season with flashes of brilliance but consistency being a challenge. Work to arrest that problematic run has already begun with Bharat Arun first and Zaheer Khan now."It's an honour to join the Lucknow Super Giants, a franchise that reflects professionalism, ambition, and vision at every level," Arun said in a statement. "My conversations with Dr. Sanjiv Goenka and the management were incredibly energizing -- there is a clear intent to invest in young Indian talent and build a long-term legacy."What excites me most is the vision for long-term development. LSG has invested in a young, talented, and dynamic group of Indian fast bowlers -- Akash Deep, Avesh Khan, Mayank Yadav, Prince Yadav, Mohsin Khan, and Akash Singh -- and I see immense potential in each of them. My mission is to help shape them into a cohesive, fearless, and tactically sharp pace unit that can challenge the best batting line-ups in the world."Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

The incident occurred in the 17th over of Australia’s innings when Bosch, after dismissing Ben Dwarshuis, made a gesture towards the opposition dugout in what officials deemed a provocative send-off.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! According to the ICC, Bosch was found guilty of breaching Article 2.5 of the Code, which covers “using language, actions or gestures which disparage or which could provoke an aggressive reaction from a batter upon his/her dismissal during an International Match.” As a result, one demerit point has been added to Bosch’s disciplinary record. He accepted the sanction proposed by the ICC Match Officials, meaning no formal hearing was required. The match itself was a high-scoring affair, with South Africa looking to level the three-match series after losing the opener. Dewald Brevis stole the show with a remarkable 125 not out from 56 balls, guiding the visitors to 218/7. His hundred came in just 41 balls, making him the youngest Men’s T20I centurion for South Africa and registering the second-fastest T20I ton for the Proteas. Australia’s chase was led by Tim David, who hit a brisk half-century off 24 balls. However, the hosts were bowled out for 165, with Bosch and Kwena Maphaka both taking three wickets each to seal a 53-run victory for South Africa.PollDo you think Corbin Bosch deserved the penalty for his gesture towards the dugout?Yes, it was unsportsmanlikeNo, it was just a competitive reaction The series now stands at 1-1, with the decider scheduled for Saturday, 16 August, in Cairns.

He highlights the sacrifices of soldiers on the border and questions the importance given to Pakistan by the media. Harbhajan was part of the India Champions team that refused to play Pakistan in the WCL. India vs Pakistan cricket players (X) NEW DELHI: "Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte. Hum unko itni importance kyun dete hain? [Why do we give them so much importance?]," legendary spinner Harbhajan Singh didn’t mince words when asked if India should boycott Pakistan in the upcoming Asia Cup, scheduled to be held in the UAE from September 9.Harbhajan was part of the recently concluded World Championship of Legends (WCL), where India Champions refused to play Pakistan Champions in the group stage and the semi-final. The squad — featuring stalwarts like Shikhar Dhawan, Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan, Irfan Pathan, Suresh Raina, and Yusuf Pathan — took this stand in the wake of the gruesome Pahalgam terror attack.Explained: Why The India-Pakistan Asia Cup Clash Cannot Be Cancelled Despite BacklashGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!For Harbhajan, “nation comes first,” and he believes the Suryakumar Yadav-led Indian team should refuse to play the neighbours."They need to understand what is important and what is not. This is as simple as that. For me, humare desh ka wo jawan jo sarhad par khada hua hai, unki families jo kayi baar unko nahi dekh paati hain, unki shahadat ho jaati hai, wo ghar wapas nahi laut paate hain — unki itni badi sacrifice hoti hai hum sabke liye. Toh ye to bahut chhoti si baat hai ki hum ek cricket match na chhod sakein [For me, the soldier who stands on the border, whose family often doesn’t get to see him, who sometimes sacrifices his life and never returns home — their sacrifice is so immense for all of us. Compared to that, this is a very small thing — that we can’t even skip playing one cricket match. It’s a very small matter]," Harbhajan told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.India are placed alongside Oman, hosts United Arab Emirates, and Pakistan in Group A. Group B, meanwhile, comprises of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, and Sri Lanka.It cannot be the case that there’s fighting on the border, tensions between the two nations, and we go to play cricket. Until these big issues are resolved, cricket is a very small matterHarbhajan Singh"Our government has the same stance, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte.' (blood and sweat cannot co-exist). It cannot be the case that there’s fighting on the border, tensions between the two nations, and we go to play cricket. Until these big issues are resolved, cricket is a very small matter. The nation always comes first," Harbhajan said."Whatever our identity is, it’s because of this country. Whether you are a player, an actor, or anyone else — no one is bigger than the nation. The country comes first, and the duties we owe to it must be fulfilled. Cricket match na khelna bahut maamuli si cheez hai desh ke saamne [Not playing a cricket match is nothing compared to the importance of the nation]," the former spinner said."Humare sarhad pe bhai khade hue hain, jo hume protect kar rahe hain, humare desh ko protect kar rahe hain — unke hausle dekho, wo kitna bada dil leke waha pe khade hue hain. Aur unke parivaar par kya beetati hai jab wo ghar wapas nahi aate. Aur hum cricket khelne chale jaate hain [At the border, our brothers are standing, protecting us and our country. Look at their courage, the big hearts with which they serve. Think about what their families go through when they don’t return home. And here we are, playing cricket]," he said.PollShould India boycott Pakistan in the upcoming Asia Cup?Yes, for the sake of national integrityNo, sports should be separate from politicsOnly if the government decidesUnsure"Hum unko itni importance kyun dete hain? Are they that important? Are they that important ki har news channel unko chalaye? When you have boycotted them, when you don't want to talk to them, then why show them here? This is the duty of the media — to stop this. They shouldn't be adding fuel to the fire."As I said, cricketers shouldn't be shaking hands with the Pakistan players, but the media shouldn't be showing them and their reactions on television, either. They are sitting in their country and can say whatever they want, but we shouldn’t be highlighting them," he said.India are the defending Asia Cup champions. They defeated Sri Lanka by 10 wickets to clinch their eighth title — the most by any country in the competition's history.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

India won the fifth and final Test vs England at The Oval (Getty Images)  Australia cricket chief Todd Greenberg on Wednesday said a reduced Test calendar could help smaller nations, as the five-day format thrived most “where it means something.” With 100 days to go until the home Ashes series against England begins in Perth, the Cricket Australia CEO stressed that quality, not quantity, was key to keeping red-ball cricket strong."We're trying to send countries bankrupt if we force them to try to play Test cricket," he told reporters.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

United endured a disastrous campaign, finishing 15th in the Premier League, which was their worst since 1973/74, and also missed out on European football.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

Speaking on The Rest Is Football podcast, Rashford said United’s instability stems from having six different managers since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. “We have been way below where we deem United to be but then if you take a step back, which I've been able to do, especially over these last six months, what do you expect?” Rashford said.Marcus Rashford was sent out on loan during the second half of the 2024/25 season (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images) “When Liverpool went through this, they got (Jurgen) Klopp, they stuck with him.

We've had that many different managers, different ideas and different strategies to win that you end up in no man's land.” Rashford, who scored 138 goals and won two FA Cups and two League Cups for United, believes the club’s identity has eroded since Ferguson’s era. “When Ferguson was in charge, not only were there principles for the first team but they were for the whole academy,” he said. “If your direction is always changing, you can't expect to win the league.”PollDo you agree with Marcus Rashford's assessment of Manchester United's managerial instability?Yes, completely agreeDo not agree His Barcelona loan includes an option to buy for €35 million at the end of his loan spell. Fans will look on with great interest as to how the Englishman will evolve under Hansi Flick in a young and experimental Barcelona team.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

'Babar should never have been compared to Kohli' – Former Pakistan cricketer
Ahmed Shehzad has criticized the comparisons between Babar Azam and Virat Kohli, stating they create undue pressure affecting Babar's performance. Shehzad emphasized Kohli's legendary status, unmatched even by MS Dhoni as a batter and athlete. Babar has now gone 72 consecutive international innings without scoring a century, with his last hundred coming against Nepal.

Shehzad emphasized Kohli's legendary status, unmatched even by MS Dhoni as a batter and athlete. Babar has now gone 72 consecutive international innings without scoring a century, with his last hundred coming against Nepal. Virat Kohli and Babar Azam Former Pakistan batter Ahmed Shehzad has come out strongly against the trend of comparing players, particularly Babar Azam, with modern-day great Virat Kohli. Speaking in an interview, Shehzad said that such comparisons are not only unfair but also add unnecessary pressure on players, which is visible in Babar’s current struggles. “When everything was going well, you were running campaigns comparing players. Now that the performances are not coming, you are saying ‘don’t compare two players’. Why not? Virat Kohli’s comparison cannot be made with anyone in the world. He is a legend of this generation, a role model. You cannot compare him even with MS Dhoni. Dhoni may have been a great captain, but as a batter, cricketer, and athlete, Kohli stands alone. No one should be compared with anyone because it’s unfair and it adds extra pressure, which we are now seeing on Babar Azam,” Shehzad said.Explained: Why The India-Pakistan Asia Cup Clash Cannot Be Cancelled Despite BacklashGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Babar’s dip in form has been a talking point for months. He has now gone 72 consecutive international innings without scoring a century, with his last hundred coming against Nepal. Since 2023, no other cricketer has endured a longer drought without a century. Adding to that, since 2024, Babar and Mohammad Rizwan are the only two batters from full-member nations with a strike rate below 80. The struggles have coincided with a change in leadership. Babar is no longer Pakistan’s captain across formats, having stepped down earlier this year following criticism over results and his own performances. The recent ODI series against West Indies only intensified the scrutiny, as Pakistan suffered a 202-run loss to concede their first bilateral ODI series to the Caribbean side in 34 years.PollShould players be compared to legends like Virat Kohli?Yes, it motivates themNo, it adds unnecessary pressureShehzad’s remarks highlight the pressure top players face when placed on the same pedestal as legends, and why the weight of public comparisons can often prove damaging to form and confidence.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Gianluigi Donnarumma with the UEFA Champions League trophy after PSG's victory over Inter in the final (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images) Gianluigi Donnarumma has confirmed he is leaving Paris Saint-Germain after being dropped from the squad for Wednesday’s UEFA Super Cup final against Tottenham. His omission came hours after PSG named new signing Lucas Chevalier, along with Matvei Safonov and Renato Marin, in their goalkeeping lineup. Chevalier’s arrival from Lille for over €40 million had already hinted at a change in the No. 1 role.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! “Unfortunately, someone has decided that I can no longer be part of the group and contribute to the team's success,” Donnarumma wrote on Instagram. “I am disappointed and disheartened.” The Italy international also thanked supporters: “I hope to have the opportunity to look the fans at the Parc des Princes in the eyes one more time and say goodbye as it should be done.” Coach Luis Enrique praised Donnarumma’s quality but explained his reasoning for the change. “Donnarumma is one of the best goalkeepers in the world, without a doubt, and even better as a person. However, this is the life of a top-level footballer, and I am 100% responsible for this difficult decision. If it were easy, anyone would do it. These decisions have to do with the profile of the goalkeeper my team needs,” he said. It is likely that Chevalier’s passing ability from the back was a decisive factor.Gianluigi Donnarumma on Instagram (Screengrab) Donnarumma’s agent, Enzo Raiola, strongly criticised PSG’s handling of the situation. “I understand the need to buy a new goalkeeper, but dismissing Gigio after everything he's done for the club is a huge lack of respect that I will assess with my lawyers. Beyond the fact that it was the coach who made this decision, he also works for the club, and my lawyers and I want to better understand their position,” Raiola told Sky Italy. PSG skipper Marquinhos admitted he would be unhappy to see the 26-year-old leave. PollShould Gianluigi Donnarumma have been dropped from PSG's squad?Yes, it's time for a change.No, he deserves to stay. Donnarumma joined PSG in 2021 after helping Italy win the UEFA Euro Championship, taking over the No. 1 spot from Keylor Navas. Now, just as Navas once did, he finds himself on the way out as a new signing steps in.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Higgins' denunciation of these incidents, highlighting the significant contributions of the Indian community to Irish society.O'Brien expressed deep sadness over the increasing racist attacks targeting the Indian diaspora in Ireland, emphasising the special relationship between Ireland and India."These attacks do not represent who we are as a people.

Your contribution to Irish society is immense and we deeply value everything you do," he added.Irish President Michael D. Higgins had previously issued a strong statement condemning these attacks through his office."The recent despicable attacks on members of the Indian community stand in stark contradiction to the values that we as a people hold dear. That any person in Ireland, particularly any young person, should be drawn into such behaviour through manipulation or provocation is to be unequivocally condemned," the president's office statement read.President Higgins also recognised the extensive contributions of the Indian community across various sectors in Ireland."We are all mindful of the immense contribution this community has made, and continues to make, to so many aspects of Irish life, in medicine, nursing, the caring professions, in cultural life, in business and enterprise, to cite just some. Their presence, their work, their culture, have been a source of enrichment and generosity to our shared life," the president's statement continued.These condemnations from prominent Irish figures come at a time when there has been an increase in reported racist incidents targeting the Indian community in Ireland.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

He shared his thoughts in an interview with PTI. His maiden tour saw him claim a 10-wicket haul in one Test and play a crucial 66 at the Oval in another, both contributing to India’s wins. Reflecting on the performance, Akash recalled what head coach Gautam Gambhir told him after his innings at the Oval. “You aren’t aware of your capabilities. I was telling you, you can do it. You have to play with this dedication always,” the 29-year-old shared.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!

Adjusting to new leadership has been easy for Akash, who made his Test debut under Rohit Sharma and now plays under Shubman Gill. He praised the calmness and on-field intelligence of the new captain.

Bermuda Triangle ‘mystery’ solved? Scientist explains the real cause behind vanishings of ships and planes
The Bermuda Triangle's infamous reputation for unexplained disappearances is largely unfounded, according to scientist Karl Kruszelnicki and supported by NOAA and Lloyd's of London. The region's high traffic volume, combined with challenging environmental conditions like the Gulf Stream and frequent storms, accounts for the incidents. Human error and equipment failure also play significant roles, debunking myths of supernatural forces.

The region's high traffic volume, combined with challenging environmental conditions like the Gulf Stream and frequent storms, accounts for the incidents. Human error and equipment failure also play significant roles, debunking myths of supernatural forces. Image: Getty Images  For decades, the Bermuda Triangle, the stretch of ocean roughly bounded by Miami, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico, has been the subject of mystery, fear, and speculation. From tales of ships vanishing without a trace to aircraft disappearing mid-flight, the region has inspired theories about supernatural forces, alien abductions, and even time warps. But according to Australian scientist Karl Kruszelnicki, backed by research from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Lloyd’s of London, these myths do not hold up. Far from being a cursed zone, the Bermuda Triangle’s so-called mysteries can be explained by natural environmental conditions, human error, and statistical probability. The truth, Kruszelnicki emphasizes, is far less otherworldly and far more rooted in the realities of nature and navigation.Bermuda Triangle poses no greater risk than other oceansKruszelnicki, supported by NOAA and Lloyd’s of London, has long maintained that the Bermuda Triangle is no more dangerous than any other ocean region. Disappearances occur at roughly the same proportional rate as elsewhere in the world’s waters. As noted by Kruszelnicki, the higher number of incidents is largely due to the Triangle being one of the busiest shipping and flight corridors in the world, where heavy traffic naturally means more recorded accidents. Statistical data confirms that when the volume of vessels and aircraft is taken into account, the accident rate is completely ordinary. This directly challenges the very foundation of the Triangle’s mythical reputation.Environmental and navigational challenges of 'Bermuda Triangle'According to Kruszelnicki, the geography and weather patterns of the Bermuda Triangle create conditions that can challenge even experienced navigators. The Gulf Stream, a powerful ocean current, can cause sudden changes in weather, generate violent storms, and push vessels off course within minutes. The region is also prone to tropical storms, hurricanes, waterspouts, and rogue waves that can overwhelm ships and planes without warning. Numerous islands and coral reefs make for hazardous, shallow navigation routes, increasing the risk of grounding or collision. Kruszelnicki also points out that certain areas experience magnetic anomalies where compasses may point to true north instead of magnetic north, leading to potential navigation errors. When all these factors combine, even a minor miscalculation can turn deadly.Human error and equipment failureAs Kruszelnicki explains, a significant number of accidents in the Bermuda Triangle can be traced to pilot or captain mistakes, faulty equipment, or outdated forecasting methods. These human and technical shortcomings often occur alongside the already challenging weather and navigational conditions of the region. In earlier decades, limited communication systems and slower emergency response times meant that vessels or aircraft in trouble had little chance of rescue. Even today, with advanced technology, mistakes and malfunctions can quickly escalate into disasters when compounded by sudden storms or rough seas. Kruszelnicki stresses that the human factor is often underestimated in popular explanations of the Triangle’s incidents.Origins of the myth of the Bermuda Triangle The term “Bermuda Triangle” was first coined in 1963 by writer Vincent Gaddis, who linked the region to a series of unexplained disappearances. His writings sparked public curiosity, but the myth gained massive momentum in 1974 when author Charles Berlitz published a bestselling book that embellished these stories with speculation about Atlantis, alien abductions, and other sensational claims. Kruszelnicki has often criticized such accounts for their lack of credible evidence and reliance on anecdotal storytelling. The entertainment value of the myth overshadowed scientific explanations, cementing its place in pop culture for generations despite the absence of verifiable proof.Famous anecdote – the Bruce Gernon storyIn 1970, pilot Bruce Gernon reported encountering a strange tunnel-like cloud while flying through the Bermuda Triangle. He claimed his instruments malfunctioned, and upon exiting the cloud, he experienced a time discrepancy of about 30 minutes. The story has been widely discussed in books, documentaries, and paranormal circles, with some suggesting it could be evidence of a time warp. Kruszelnicki, however, remains skeptical, noting that the account is anecdotal and lacks corroborating evidence. Many experts, including Kruszelnicki, believe it could be explained by meteorological phenomena such as unusual cloud formations or optical illusions.Scientific consensus over Bermuda TriangleThe conclusion from NOAA, the US Navy, and Lloyd’s of London — all echoed by Kruszelnicki — is clear: the Bermuda Triangle is not more hazardous than any other heavily traveled ocean region. The so-called mystery is a product of natural hazards, geographic challenges, human mistakes, and decades of exaggerated storytelling. Statistically, the accident rates are consistent with those in other busy maritime and aviation areas. While the legend of the Bermuda Triangle may continue to inspire curiosity and creativity, the evidence, as Kruszelnicki emphasizes, points to a reality grounded in science, not the supernatural.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

This ancient water, isolated for millennia, provides unprecedented insights into Earth's early conditions and potential for life in extreme environments. Professor Barbara Sherwood Lollar's team's findings challenge existing assumptions and open new avenues for astrobiological research.  In 2016, scientists discovered the oldest water on Earth deep within a Canadian mine, estimated to be over 2 billion years old. This rare water had been trapped underground, isolated from surface influences, offering unique insights into Earth’s ancient geological past and extreme environments. Professor Barbara Sherwood Lollar and her team made this remarkable discovery in the Kidd Creek Mine in Ontario, Canada. The water's extraordinary age and composition have important implications for understanding subterranean ecosystems and the possibility of life in harsh conditions, including on other planets.This finding marks a groundbreaking moment in geology and astrobiology, revealing how Earth’s deepest waters can hold secrets from billions of years ago.Discovery of the oldest water on Earth in Kidd Creek MineThe oldest water on Earth was uncovered at a depth of about 3 kilometers in the Kidd Creek Mine, Ontario. This water had remained sealed away for roughly 1.5 to 2.6 billion years, surpassing previous finds of ancient water worldwide. The research team, led by geologist Barbara Sherwood Lollar, tested the water’s age using isotopic analysis, confirming its unprecedented age. The longevity and isolation of this water make it a living snapshot of early Earth conditions, preserved untouched for billions of years.This groundbreaking discovery and detailed scientific analysis were published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications in 2014, offering a comprehensive look at the water’s age, chemistry, and significance. The findings challenge previous assumptions about Earth’s hydrological cycles and open new questions about the movement and preservation of water in the planet’s deep crust.Scientific importance of the oldest water on earth discoveryFinding the oldest water on Earth has major scientific significance. It offers clues about how microbial life could survive in isolated environments for billions of years, far from sunlight. This challenges previous assumptions about life’s limits on Earth and extends hope for discovering life in similar extraterrestrial environments, such as Mars or icy moons like Europa. The high salinity and unique chemical composition of this ancient water also provide insight into geological processes that occurred billions of years ago. These findings expand our understanding of Earth’s deep biosphere and the resilience of life. Moreover, studying such ancient water helps scientists understand how life might adapt to extreme conditions, pushing the boundaries of astrobiology and earth sciences.Tasting the oldest water on earth: A geologist’s unique experienceIn a remarkable gesture, Professor Sherwood Lollar tasted the oldest water on Earth herself.

Woman astronomer paid 30 cents an hour: unlocked cosmic distances; still missed out on Nobel Prize
Henrietta Swan Leavitt worked as a Harvard “computer” earning just 30 cents an hour, yet her groundbreaking discovery of the period-luminosity relationship transformed astronomy. Her work enabled scientists to measure cosmic distances and understand the expanding universe. Despite this monumental contribution, Leavitt never received a Nobel Prize during her lifetime, highlighting the challenges faced by women in science.

Her work enabled scientists to measure cosmic distances and understand the expanding universe. Despite this monumental contribution, Leavitt never received a Nobel Prize during her lifetime, highlighting the challenges faced by women in science.  Henrietta Swan Leavitt, an American astronomer whose groundbreaking discovery revolutionized how we measure the cosmos. Born in 1868, Leavitt began working at the Harvard College Observatory at a time when women were excluded from operating telescopes and instead employed as “computers” to analyze astronomical data. Despite earning just 30 cents an hour, her dedication and meticulous research led to one of the most important astronomical breakthroughs of the 20th century.In 1908, Leavitt discovered the period-luminosity relationship of Cepheid variable stars, showing a direct link between their brightness and pulsation period. This discovery became the key to measuring vast cosmic distances and ultimately helped astronomers like Edwin Hubble prove that the universe is expanding. Yet, despite her monumental contributions, Leavitt was never awarded a Nobel Prize during her lifetime.The discovery that changed astronomy foreverLeavitt’s key insight came from studying Cepheid variable stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, a galaxy assumed to be at a uniform distance from Earth. By carefully analyzing photographic plates, she found that the brightness of these stars varied in a predictable way tied to their pulsation period: the longer the period, the brighter the star. This relationship, now known as Leavitt’s Law, gave astronomers a powerful “standard candle,” an object of known brightness that can be used to calculate distances in space.Using this standard candle method, astronomers could measure how far away these stars and by extension, the galaxies they reside in actually were. This was a breakthrough in cosmic distance measurement, allowing scientists to determine the scale of the universe with unprecedented accuracy. Leavitt’s discovery became the foundation for Edwin Hubble’s later work in the 1920s where he used Cepheid variables to prove that the Milky Way was just one of many galaxies and that the universe itself was expanding.Overcoming barriers as a woman in scienceHenrietta Swan Leavitt’s career unfolded during a time when women faced serious discrimination in science. Women were largely relegated to supportive roles and denied opportunities such as telescope operation and academic recognition. Leavitt was paid a modest wage of about 30 cents an hour as a “computer” at Harvard, tasked with analyzing star data rather than conducting independent research.Despite these limitations, she showed extraordinary focus and persistence. Leavitt’s progressive hearing loss later in life made her work even more challenging, yet she continued her observations and calculations until her untimely death at the age of 53. Tragically, although her work was foundational for modern astronomy, she never received the Nobel Prize or equivalent accolades during her lifetime, and a posthumous nomination was not permitted.Legacy and lasting impact on cosmologyLeavitt’s period-luminosity relationship remains one of the cornerstones of astrophysics. It revolutionized the way distances to faraway celestial objects are measured, enabling astronomers to map the universe on a grand scale. This method underpins modern cosmology, helping scientists determine not only distances but also the rate at which the universe is expanding, key to the Big Bang theory.Edwin Hubble famously used Leavitt’s discovery to measure the distances to galaxies beyond the Milky Way and uncover the expanding nature of the universe, a milestone that forever changed humanity’s understanding of our place in the cosmos. Today, Henrietta Swan Leavitt is celebrated as a pioneering figure in astronomy whose brilliance and perseverance overcame societal and physical obstacles, leaving a profound legacy that continues to guide scientific exploration.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

These magnetic nanobots address tooth sensitivity. CalBots seal dentinal tubules using a bioceramic formula. Tests on extracted teeth show promising results. Animal trials demonstrate complete behavioral recovery. The team sees this as a step towards advanced nanorobotics. This innovation offers lasting relief for millions. The CalBots are made from safe materials.  BENGALURU: For millions of people, the sudden, sharp pain of tooth sensitivity can turn a sip of cold water into a jolt. Now, researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), in collaboration with Bengaluru-based deep-tech startup Theranautilus, have engineered “CalBots” – magnetic nanobots that can seal the problem at its source.As per IISc, CalBots are 400-nanometre particles loaded with a calcium silicate-based bioceramic formula, designed to travel deep inside dentinal tubules, the tiny tunnels in the tooth that lead to nerve endings. Guided by an external magnetic field, the bots can penetrate up to 500 micrometres into the tubules and self-assemble into stable, cement-like plugs that recreate the tooth’s natural barrier. One application, the team says, can offer lasting relief.Dental hypersensitivity affects nearly one in four people worldwide and occurs when enamel erosion or gum recession exposes the dentine layer beneath, IISc said. The tubules in dentine act as direct pathways to the nerves, which is why even mild temperature changes can trigger pain. “We didn’t want to create a slightly better version of what’s already out there. We wanted a technology that solves a real problem in a way that no one’s attempted before,” Shanmukh Peddi, postdoctoral researcher at IISc’s Centre for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE) and co-founder of Theranautilus. The team used a completely new class of bioceramic cement for the nanobots. While bioceramics are common in orthopaedics and dentistry, the formulation was designed specifically for hypersensitivity – to travel deeper and last longer.To test the approach, they worked first on extracted human teeth. “On these samples, we applied CalBots under a magnetic field for 20 minutes, during which the bots sealed the dentinal tubules by forming deep, stable plugs – a result confirmed through high-resolution imaging,” Peddi said.They then moved to animal trials, inducing sensitivity in mice and tracking their drinking behaviour. “Healthy mice drank both cold and room temperature water equally. But sensitive mice completely avoided cold water. After treatment, they started drinking it again. We saw 100% behavioural recovery. That was a big moment for us,” he said.The CalBots are made entirely from materials classified as ‘Generally Recognised as Safe’ and passed toxicity tests in mice. “This is a compelling demonstration of what nanorobotics can achieve, and how they could significantly impact future healthcare,” said Ambarish Ghosh, professor at CeNSE and one of the study’s corresponding authors.Debayan Dasgupta, former PhD student at CeNSE and co-founder of Theranautilus, sees this as part of a bigger technological shift. “We’ve created a regenerative, active nanomaterial – a step towards the kind of ‘tiny mechanical surgeons’ Richard Feynman once envisioned,” he said.Peddi added: “This is something we’ve worked towards silently for years. And the fact that we’ve done it here, in India, makes us very happy.”About the AuthorChethan KumarChethan Kumar is a Senior Assistant Editor with the Times of India.

It is an interstellar object moving at 209,000 km/h. Hubble images show it is smaller than thought, about 5.6 km wide. It is a comet with a glowing tail. Scientists estimate it is eight billion years old. It poses no threat to Earth. NASA uses telescopes to study it.  NASA has revealed exciting new information about a mysterious interstellar object called 3I/ATLAS, speeding through our solar system at extraordinary velocities. First detected on July 1, this visitor from beyond our star system has fascinated scientists globally with its astonishing speed of 130,000 miles per hour and intriguing characteristics. Recent observations from the Hubble Space Telescope have captured the clearest images to date, offering key insights into its size, makeup, and path. These discoveries represent a significant advancement in our understanding of these rare travelers crossing the galaxy into our cosmic neighborhood.NASA confirms 3I/ATLAS as the fastest interstellar object ever detectedNASA’s Hubble Space Telescope observations have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is travelling through our solar system at an extraordinary speed of 130,000 miles per hour (209,000 km/h), making it the fastest interstellar object ever recorded. This speed far exceeds that of previous interstellar visitors such as ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. Scientists explain that the object’s velocity is the result of billions of years of gravitational interactions, known as the “gravitational slingshot effect,” where passing stars, planets, and nebulae impart additional momentum to the comet. This extreme speed means the object is only briefly visible as it races through, providing a fleeting window of opportunity for study. NASA’s continuous monitoring aims to capture as much data as possible during its swift passage.Image: Daily MailSize estimates refined: NASA reveals 3I/ATLAS is smaller but still immenseInitial observations by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory suggested that 3I/ATLAS’s icy core might be around seven miles (11.2 km) wide. However, NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has now refined these estimates, revealing that the core is smaller — at most 3.5 miles (5.6 km) across, and possibly as little as 1,000 feet (320 meters) in diameter. Despite being smaller than first believed, this still makes 3I/ATLAS the largest interstellar object ever discovered, dwarfing the next largest known visitor by up to 14 times. The high-resolution images also highlight the comet’s glowing gas halo, which had made it appear larger in earlier, less detailed observations. Understanding the true size helps scientists model its composition and behavior as it interacts with solar radiation.NASA confirms 3I/ATLAS’s cometary nature and its spectacular glowing tailThanks to NASA’s powerful telescopes, scientists have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is not a solid rock but a comet — a chunk of ice, frozen gases, and dust surrounded by a halo of evaporating material. The Hubble images reveal a dust plume streaming from the side of the comet heated by the Sun, along with a faint tail trailing behind it. This tail is formed as the comet’s surface warms up, causing ice to vaporize and release gas and dust into space, creating the characteristic glowing appearance. This phenomenon is similar to that seen in comets within our solar system, but 3I/ATLAS’s interstellar origin and extreme speed make it a rare and valuable subject for study. NASA expects the tail and dust plume to become more pronounced as the object approaches its closest point to the Sun.Ancient traveler: NASA estimates 3I/ATLAS is twice as old as our solar systemOne of the most astonishing revelations from NASA’s studies is the estimated age of 3I/ATLAS. Scientific analysis suggests this object has been orbiting the Milky Way for at least eight billion years — roughly twice the age of our own 4.6 billion-year-old solar system. This implies 3I/ATLAS formed long before our Sun and planets came into existence, making it a true cosmic relic. Its journey through the galaxy has likely included multiple gravitational encounters with stars and interstellar clouds, which may have shaped its trajectory and speed. Studying such an ancient object offers scientists a unique glimpse into the conditions and materials present in the early universe and helps refine models of galactic evolution.Safe passage confirmed by NASA: No threat to EarthDespite its immense speed and close approach to the Sun, NASA has assured the public that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth. The comet will reach its closest point to the Sun in late October, passing just inside the orbit of Mars at about 130 million miles (210 million kilometers). Crucially, it will be on the opposite side of the Sun relative to Earth during this time, ensuring no risk of collision or gravitational disturbance. NASA continues to monitor the comet’s trajectory precisely, as the interaction with the Sun’s heat may slightly alter its path. After passing the Sun, 3I/ATLAS will head back out into interstellar space, continuing its long journey through the galaxy.A new era of discovery: NASA leads the charge in interstellar object research3I/ATLAS marks only the third confirmed interstellar object ever detected, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. NASA’s advancements in telescope technology, sky surveys, and space observatories like Hubble have ushered in a new era of interstellar discovery. Researchers expect that as survey instruments become more sensitive and comprehensive, the frequency of detecting such visitors will increase. NASA plans to utilize not only Hubble but also the James Webb Space Telescope, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory to study 3I/ATLAS in multiple wavelengths. This coordinated effort will deepen our understanding of the composition, origin, and behavior of interstellar objects and their role in the cosmic ecosystem.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

These massive structures, sculpted by ancient underwater avalanches, indicate the Atlantic Ocean connected earlier than previously thought. This discovery provides insights into Cretaceous climate shifts and tectonic movements, offering crucial data for modern geology and climate science.  Buried nearly a kilometre beneath the Atlantic seabed west of Guinea-Bissau lies a geological time-capsule: gigantic 117-million-year-old mud waves sculpted by dense, underwater avalanches. A new study published in Global and Planetary Change reveals that these ancient structures were formed when early Atlantic waters carved through the Earth’s crust, much earlier than previously believed. This discovery reshapes our understanding of Atlantic Ocean formation, offers fresh perspectives on Cretaceous climate shifts, and provides clues to tectonic movements that governed our planet’s evolving geography. From deep-sea sediment patterns to global carbon cycles, these mud waves, once hidden, now tell a story with far-reaching implications for modern geology and climate science.Underwater mud waves push the Atlantic's birth date back to 117 million years agoRecent research published in Global and Planetary Change (2025) by Duarte, Nicholson, and colleagues has shed new light on the early history of the Atlantic Ocean. Using a combination of modern seismic imaging and archived drilling data from 1975, the team identified a series of massive 117-million-year-old mud waves buried deep beneath the Atlantic seafloor. These geological giants, stretching over a kilometer in length and rising hundreds of meters high, were formed when dense, salty water from the young North Atlantic spilled into the deeper southern basins, creating powerful underwater currents. The composition and layering of these mud waves reveal that such flows occurred far earlier than previously believed, suggesting that the Equatorial Atlantic Gateway, the oceanic passage linking the northern and southern Atlantic opened sooner than most geological models predicted. This pushes back the estimated timeline of when the Atlantic became a fully connected ocean, making the discovery a crucial piece in reconstructing Earth’s plate tectonic and oceanographic history. Not only does this finding refine our understanding of how and when the Atlantic took shape, but it also offers insights into the role of deep-water currents in shaping the seafloor over millions of years.Sediment patterns illuminate early ocean currents and climate changeThe formation of these 117-million-year-old mud waves was far more than an isolated ocean-floor event, it represented a profound turning point in Earth’s climate and geological history. When the young North Atlantic’s saline waters finally breached into the long-isolated southern basins, they encountered dense, carbon-rich deep waters that had been locked away for millions of years. This sudden mixing unleashed colossal underwater mud avalanches, cascading across the seabed with immense force and reshaping the ocean floor’s topography on a scale rarely seen in Earth’s past.The consequences reached far beyond the geology. This tectonic–oceanic upheaval likely interrupted one of the planet’s most important climate-regulating processes: the long-term burial of carbon in marine sediments. By disturbing these ancient, carbon-heavy layers, the event may have kept vast amounts of greenhouse gases circulating in the atmosphere, helping sustain the elevated global temperatures characteristic of the mid-Cretaceous, a period often referred to as one of Earth’s “greenhouse worlds.” Such persistent warmth not only influenced ocean chemistry and circulation but also shaped the evolution and distribution of marine life for millions of years afterward.Understanding precisely when the Equatorial Atlantic Gateway opened is therefore critical. It marks the moment the Atlantic transitioned from a series of isolated basins into a fully connected ocean, altering heat and nutrient flows on a global scale. By reconstructing this event, scientists can better model ancient ocean currents, climate feedback loops, and the deep-time mechanisms that still echo in today’s climate system. In essence, these mud waves are not just relics of a vanished seafloor, they are a geological signature of the forces that have shaped, and continue to shape, Earth’s climate trajectory.Why this discovery matters: from paleoceanography to climate modellingKnowing that the Atlantic began to take shape around 117 million years ago, evidence preserved in those colossal buried mud waves, significantly sharpens scientists’ ability to model ancient ocean behaviour, tectonic shifts, and climate feedback loops. This revised timeline offers a clearer window into how early ocean gateways controlled the movement of heat across the planet, regulated carbon sequestration in marine sediments, and set the stage for long-term cooling or warming trends.By tracing these deep-time processes, researchers can better understand the intricate relationship between ocean circulation and Earth’s climate system. Crucially, such knowledge is not confined to the past, it provides a framework for anticipating the effects of today’s oceanic changes. From accelerating polar ice melt to shifting global currents, the same mechanisms that once shaped the Cretaceous world could, in altered form, dictate the trajectory of our future climate.Also read| Study reveals nature's hardest teeth: Chitons inspire future material designAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Although there is still no specific therapeutic medicine, a vaccine has been developed and approved for use in certain parts of the world, but no licensed or approved dengue vaccines are available in India, a high-incidence country.Led by Sweden’s Karolinska Institute, the project involves researchers from eight European universities, five Indian institutions, a university from the US, and an NGO from Guatemala, all working in the field of public healthcare and medical research.The total project cost is estimated to be around Rs 90 crore. The EU has already sanctioned Euro 8 million (nearly Rs 81 crore). The balance will be funded by the Govt of India through the Dept of Biotechnology, Ujjwal Neogi, the coordinator for the project, also a senior lecturer at Karolinska Institute, told TOI.The EU partners are collaborating with several leading institutes in India that include Artemis Hospital and Max Hospital in New Delhi, Kasturba Medical College Hospital in Mangalore, Regional Centre for Biotechnology, Faridabad. The India part is being led by National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani in West Bengal. “We’re bringing together the brightest minds from Europe and India to understand the disease at a molecular level and design better tools for diagnosis and prevention,” Neogi from Karolinska Institute said.Stockholm-based Karolinska Institute is a 215-year-old world-leading medical research university that every year selects the Nobel Prize winner in physiology or medicine.The project has a dual objective. Primarily, it aims at better understanding the complete lifecycle of dengue infection: From the origin of the virus, to how it spreads in human beings to how it affects the human body. And then to come out with solutions so that the spread of this mosquito-induced disease could be contained, its impacts on human beings could be predicted during the early onset of the disease, and could be cured more effectively and quickly than now.With an estimated 100 million infections annually across 144 countries leading to over 10,000 deaths, this predominantly tropical disease is now spreading in Europe, mainly due to climate change, the project’s website noted.Another equally important objective of the project is to better understand how, in general, virus-induced pandemics spread and to prepare a blueprint for countering such incidents in future. The secondary objective of the project grew in importance in the backdrop of the Covid-induced global pandemic, researchers working in the project told TOI.From India’s side, the partners will make “original research contributions to the overall objectives of the program, that is pioneering innovative antiviral strategies to alleviate the burden of dengue infection while deepening our understanding of its complex pathogenesis through cutting-edge multi-modal technologies,” said Arindam Maitra, Professor, National Institute of Biomedical Genomics. Maitra is the chief coordinator for the researchers in India involved in this project.“The Indian team will collect, clinically characterize, undertake viral and host multiomics investigations to identify key factors facilitating severe disease and undertake research to come up with antiviral and immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies (that can regulate body's immune response) in collaboration with the EU team.” The ‘multiomics investigations’ here refer to an integrated data analysis of various DNA and RNA molecules within a dengue-infected person to identify novel biomarkers and improve disease classification.According to Neogi, among various cutting-edge research techniques, the project will use the brain-on-chip process. This is a relatively new research technique that simulates a human brain’s functions under a controlled environment in a laboratory. The researchers would be using the brain-on-chip process to see what happens to a human brain when the dengue virus infects the body. They expect the same technique could also give them some idea about combating the virus that is spread through mosquitoes. The technology will be transferred to India from the EU partners.About the primary takeaways for India from this project, Maitra said that given the increasing occurrence of severe disease and death following dengue virus infection in India and other parts of the globe, “this research initiative is expected to provide information and solutions which have the potential to play a major role in combating this challenge.”About the AuthorPartha SinhaPartha, senior assistant editor (markets) at The Times of India, Mumbai, covers the financial markets, mainly the stock market, mutual funds, banking and insurance sectors.

CMO-DA has shown promising results in simulated medical cases, achieving high diagnostic accuracy. This technology aims to provide reliable healthcare guidance in the challenging environment of deep space, potentially transforming healthcare worldwide. Source: Google Cloud As human space missions venture farther into deep space, the challenge of maintaining crew health grows increasingly complex. Unlike current missions aboard the International Space Station (ISS), where astronauts rely heavily on constant communication with Earth-based medical teams, regular medication supplies, and the option to return within six months, future journeys to the Moon, Mars, and beyond demand greater medical self-sufficiency. NASA and Google have teamed up to develop a breakthrough solution: an AI-powered medical assistant designed to support astronauts autonomously during extended spaceflight.NASA calls for AI medical assistant to support astronauts on Moon and Mars missionsWith missions extending beyond low Earth orbit, astronauts will face significant hurdles in healthcare management. Presently, ISS crews benefit from:Continuous real-time communication with ground-based medical expertsRoutine delivery of medicines and medical suppliesEvacuation options within months if medical emergencies ariseHowever, for lunar and Mars expeditions, communication delays can stretch up to 20 minutes each way, resupply missions will be infrequent, and emergency returns could take months or years. This scenario creates a pressing need for onboard medical autonomy, enabling astronauts to diagnose and treat health issues without immediate Earth-based assistance.Source: NASANASA and Google collaboration: Developing the Crew Medical Officer Digital Assistant (CMO-DA)To meet these challenges, NASA has partnered with Google to create the Crew Medical Officer Digital Assistant (CMO-DA) — an AI-driven medical tool designed for autonomous use by astronauts. This digital assistant is intended to serve as a virtual healthcare provider in space, bridging the gap when a medical doctor is not present onboard and communication with Earth is limited or delayed.Key features of CMO-DA:Multimodal Interface: Allows interaction via speech, text, and image inputs to facilitate easy use in space conditions.Cloud-Based Infrastructure: Operates within Google Cloud’s Vertex AI environment, enabling continuous application development and AI model training.Collaborative AI Model Development: NASA maintains ownership of the app’s source code and contributes actively to refine AI models alongside Google’s technology and third-party integrations.NASA’s AI medical assistant achieves high accuracy in testing key medical scenariosCMO-DA has already undergone preliminary testing using three simulated medical cases: ankle injury, flank pain, and ear pain. A panel comprising two physicians and one astronaut assessed the assistant’s performance across four key areas:Initial patient assessmentMedical history takingClinical reasoning and diagnosisTreatment planningThe results were encouraging, with diagnostic accuracies recorded as:88% for ankle injury74% for flank pain80% for ear painThese outcomes indicate strong potential for the assistant to provide reliable autonomous medical support during space missions.NASA’s plan to enhance CMO-DA for advanced space healthcareNASA plans an incremental development approach to continuously improve the CMO-DA system. Upcoming updates will focus on:Integrating medical device data: Incorporating inputs from onboard diagnostic tools for richer information.Enhancing situational awareness: Adapting AI algorithms to account for spaceflight-specific factors such as microgravity’s effects on human physiology.Contextualized medical advice: Delivering treatment recommendations tailored to the unique environment and conditions of deep space.This will enable the assistant to offer more precise, relevant, and timely healthcare guidance in the isolated and challenging environment of space.How NASA’s AI medical assistant could transform healthcare worldwideWhile designed for space, the implications of this AI-powered medical assistant extend far beyond astronaut health. David Cruley, a Google Public Sector engineer involved in the project, noted that although regulatory approval plans for terrestrial use are not yet confirmed, success in space missions could catalyze the adoption of similar AI tools on Earth.Possible benefits on Earth include:Improved medical care in remote and underserved areasEnhanced diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision supportIncreased accessibility to healthcare expertise in environments lacking specialistsNASA and Google also envision that lessons learned from CMO-DA’s development will accelerate innovation in the broader field of AI-driven medicine, ultimately improving patient care worldwide.Also Read | 4.56-billion-year-old McDonough meteorite older than Earth crashes into Georgia home; stuns scientistsAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Swift has cultivated a loyal fanbase through immersive experiences and reclaimed ownership of her music, disrupting industry norms. Her relentless work ethic and strategic decisions have propelled her into a powerful figure, offering a blueprint for success in any field.  Behind the glittering lights and chart-topping hits lies a carefully crafted strategy that has propelled Taylor Swift into one of the most powerful figures in the global entertainment industry. A NASA engineer has cracked the code behind Taylor Swift’s meteoric rise to global superstardom, revealing insights that extend far beyond her music. Sinéad O’Sullivan, a Harvard Business School graduate and seasoned rocket scientist, spent years analyzing Swift’s career and business strategies.In her upcoming book Good Ideas and Power Moves, O’Sullivan says that Swift’s success isn’t just about catchy songs or lucky breaks. Instead, it is the result of deliberate, strategic moves that anyone can learn from. From building a loyal fanbase to rewriting industry rules, Swift has crafted a personal brand and empire that generates billions and reshapes markets, offering a blueprint for success in any field.Taylor Swift’s strategic empire-building beyond musicO’Sullivan’s research highlights that Swift’s genius lies in her ability to construct entire worlds, not just songs. Taylor Swift has expertly crafted an expansive fan universe known as the “Swiftverse,” which goes far beyond her music to create an immersive, interactive experience for her fans, affectionately called Swifties. This world includes elaborate storytelling, hidden Easter eggs in lyrics, themed visuals, and multi-platform social media engagement that encourages fans to connect deeply, not only with her art but also with each other.This fosters a strong sense of community and loyalty, transforming fans into passionate supporters who actively drive her brand’s growth. The massive success of her Eras Tour exemplifies this phenomenon, injecting an estimated $5 billion into the US economy through ticket sales, travel, accommodations, merchandise, and job creation, especially boosting sectors like tourism and retail during a crucial post-pandemic recovery phase.Taylor Swift’s control over music rights and relentless work ethicA cornerstone of Swift’s empire is her strategic decision to reclaim ownership of her early work by re-recording her first six albums as “Taylor’s Version.” This move disrupted conventional music industry norms after her masters were sold without her consent, allowing her to regain financial control and send a powerful message about artist empowerment and creative agency.Beyond this, Swift’s meteoric rise is fueled by her relentless work ethic, unwavering self-belief, and deliberate choices. Balancing intensive touring, continuous music production, and broad business ventures, she demonstrates that meaningful success comes from taking risks, learning from failures, and staying true to one’s vision. Her journey offers a blueprint for aspiring entrepreneurs and artists on the importance of resilience, persistence, and owning one’s path to success.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Scientists are studying this biological marvel to inspire the creation of super-durable materials. This research could revolutionize industries by enabling the development of advanced cutting tools, biomedical implants, and self-repairing structures, mimicking nature's ingenious design. Source: The University of Chicago You’d expect the hardest teeth in nature to belong to sharks, crocodiles, or some ancient dino. But surprisingly the title goes to a slow-moving, algae-scraping mollusc called the chiton. This groundbreaking new study published in Science reveals that chitons, marine molluscs you’ve probably never heard of, grow teeth that aren’t just hard, they're harder than stainless steel, zirconium oxide, and even human enamel. And here’s the real kicker: they do it at room temperature, using a precise, protein-controlled biological system.Scientists say this process could inspire the next generation of supermaterials used in cutting tools, surgical implants, dental prosthetics, and protective coatings , all with nanoscale precision. Let’s dive into the science behind nature’s hardest, most magnetic teeth. Curious? Let’s break down what the study found and why it's got scientists (and engineers) geeking out.What are chitons and why do their teeth matter?Chitons are small, ancient marine molluscs that cling to rocks and feed by scraping algae off surfaces using a ribbon-like tongue called a radula. The teeth on this radula are constantly worn down and regrown and they happen to be the hardest known biological material on Earth, even stronger than enamel or bone.Scientists have long been fascinated by the strength of chiton teeth, but this new study reveals why they're so strong and how their structure could influence materials science.The science behind chiton teeth: Built to crushThe researchers used high-resolution electron microscopy and spectrometry to analyse the nanostructure of chiton teeth. What they found was extraordinary:The teeth contain magnetite, an iron-based mineral, arranged in a tightly packed, nanoscale crystalline structure.These crystals are embedded in a soft organic matrix, which offers both rigidity and flexibility, a rare combination in natural materials.This combination makes the teeth not just hard but incredibly wear-resistant, ideal for scraping rock surfaces without damage.Why this study could change future materialsThe implications of this research stretch far beyond marine biology. Materials inspired by chiton teeth could be used to:Build durable coatings for cutting tools, drills, and other high-friction equipmentCreate longer-lasting materials for aerospace or biomedical applicationsDevelop self-repairing synthetic structures that mimic how chitons regrow teethThe study's lead author, Dr. Erika Easterling, explained that nature often holds the blueprints for advanced engineering: "By studying organisms like chitons, we can reverse-engineer solutions for some of our toughest material challenges."Now that the microstructure of chiton teeth is better understood, researchers are working on synthetic replication using nanomaterials. The goal is to reproduce this biological architecture in labs and eventually at scale, creating next-gen materials that combine hardness, flexibility, and self-renewal.Nature's toughest teeth may soon inspire industrial revolutions, proving once again that biology often beats the lab in innovation.Also read| These 15 science facts are so bizarre, you'll think we're lying (but we're not)About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

This gas giant, larger than Saturn but less massive, orbits a star only one-fifth the Sun's mass. The discovery suggests that large planets might be more common around small stars than previously believed. Source: Earth.com  Astronomers have discovered a giant planet named TOI-6894b orbiting a very small red dwarf star that has only one-fifth the mass of the Sun. Despite the star’s small size and low brightness, TOI-6894b is larger than Saturn but has only half its mass. This surprising discovery challenges previous ideas that such tiny stars cannot form or hold large gas planets. According to a study published in Nature Astronomy and reported by Earth.com, large planets may be more common around small stars than scientists once believed, opening new possibilities for understanding how planets form.Huge planet discovered orbiting one of the smallest red dwarf stars: TOI-6894BTOI-6894b was found using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Its host star, TOI-6894, is a cool red dwarf, much smaller and dimmer than our Sun. Despite this, TOI-6894b has a radius larger than Saturn but with only half its mass. This makes the star the smallest known to have such a large gas giant orbiting it. This discovery challenges the assumption that small stars cannot form or hold giant planets. TOI-6894b’s low density suggests an extremely puffy atmosphere, possibly influenced by stellar radiation or internal heat, requiring further observational studies.Challenging planet formation theories: How TOI-6894b formed around a tiny starTraditional planet formation theories, such as core accretion, suggest that low-mass stars have thin discs of gas and dust that are not enough to build large planets. Scientists believe TOI-6894b could have formed through a modified core accretion process or through gravitational instability, where parts of the disc collapse quickly under their own gravity. Neither explanation perfectly fits current data, highlighting the need for further research to understand how such a massive planet can form around a tiny star.James Webb Telescope to study TOI-6894b’s rare methane and ammonia atmosphereTOI-6894b orbits far enough from its star to have a relatively cool atmosphere, with an estimated temperature of 420 Kelvin (about 147 degrees Celsius). Its atmosphere is expected to be rich in methane, which is rare among exoplanets, and may contain ammonia as well. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will observe this planet soon, providing valuable data to better understand its atmosphere and formation. This could offer important clues about planet formation in environments very different from our own solar system.Implications for astronomy and the Milky WayThis discovery has big implications for astronomy. Since most stars in the Milky Way are small red dwarfs, finding a giant planet around one suggests that such planets may be more common than previously thought. The study involved researchers from the University of Warwick, University College London, and the University of Birmingham. TOI-6894b challenges existing models and will help scientists improve their understanding of planet formation and the diversity of planetary systems in our galaxy.Also read | Seven superclouds: Giant gas neighbors of our solar system discovered About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

This visual evidence provides an unprecedented opportunity to study seismic ruptures in real-time. The analysis of this footage could refine earthquake prediction models and enhance early-warning systems, potentially saving lives in the future. Representative AI Image For the first time in history, scientists have captured clear footage of the Earth’s surface physically splitting during a powerful earthquake. The dramatic event, recorded by high-speed cameras and ground sensors in a remote seismic hotspot, shows the crust tearing apart along a fault line in real time. This unprecedented visual evidence offers scientists an extraordinary opportunity to study the mechanics of seismic ruptures, potentially improving early-warning systems and our understanding of how earthquakes propagate. Experts are calling it a milestone moment in the field of geophysics.How the Earth split was capturedThe footage was obtained during a recent earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale. Researchers had positioned advanced recording equipment in the region after detecting increased seismic activity over the past few months. When the quake struck, cameras captured the ground shifting violently, creating a visible crack stretching hundreds of meters. Normally, such events occur too quickly and unpredictably to record in detail, making this a rare scientific achievement. Researchers hope this footage will also inspire the development of new, real-time monitoring technologies for earthquake-prone regions.Pulse-like rupture and curved slip - Analysis of Myanmar earthquake ruptureWhy this matters for earthquake scienceSeismologists explain that seeing the rupture unfold on camera allows them to analyze fault movement frame by frame. This can reveal the speed of the split, the energy released, and how the rupture propagated along the fault. The findings could refine earthquake prediction models and help urban planners design more resilient infrastructure in quake-prone areas.With precise rupture dynamics now observable, scientists believe they can enhance algorithms used in earthquake early-warning networks. By recognizing specific seismic signatures just before a rupture occurs, these systems might provide precious seconds or even minutes of warning, potentially saving lives. Additionally, researchers aim to integrate this real-world data into machine learning models to improve the accuracy of earthquake simulations. This innovative approach could revolutionize how scientists predict seismic impacts and inform emergency response strategies. Continued advancements in imaging technology and data analysis are crucial for unlocking deeper insights into earthquake behavior.Next steps in the researchThe video will undergo detailed analysis by an international team of geologists and engineers. They plan to compare the footage with seismic data from the same event to build a more complete understanding of the quake. This collaborative effort will also involve sharing findings with global earthquake monitoring agencies to enhance worldwide preparedness. The team hopes that these insights will lead to improved building codes and disaster management protocols in vulnerable regions. In addition, the team intends to simulate the rupture in advanced earthquake laboratories to test how different soil types and fault conditions affect ground movement. Furthermore, they aim to develop predictive models that can be customized for different geographic regions, enhancing local risk assessments. This could help forecast how future quakes might impact specific regions. Results from this research could be published within the next year, offering new insights into one of Earth’s most powerful natural processes.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

While Yuri orbited Earth on the ISS, Ekaterina waited in Houston, bridging the distance through a live video link. This extraordinary event showcased love's ability to transcend boundaries, blending space exploration with personal connection and capturing global attention. Source: Russia Beyond On August 10, 2003, the International Space Station became the setting for one of the most extraordinary weddings ever recorded. Orbiting Earth at 28,000 km/h, Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko said “I do” to his American fiancée Ekaterina Dmitriev, who stood waiting 400 km below at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.This was no publicity stunt—it was a daring blend of love and spaceflight, navigating complex legal, technical, and cultural hurdles. In a moment that bridged two worlds—the boundless expanse of space and the intimacy of human connection—it proved that even in the most advanced realms of exploration, the heart still finds its own orbit.International Space Station becomes the world’s most unusual wedding venueThe ISS is a multi-national laboratory in low Earth orbit, a place where every minute is carefully scheduled for experiments, maintenance, and communications. Weddings were not part of its official mission objectives.Yet, on that August day, the station’s communication systems—designed for critical mission updates, data transfer, and crew coordination—were temporarily adapted to facilitate a marriage ceremony. At the time, the ISS was orbiting roughly 400 km above Earth, completing one orbit every 90 minutes. That meant that during the wedding, the station likely passed over multiple continents, giving “worldwide coverage” a very literal meaning.How Russian cosmonaut long-distance romance led to the first wedding in spaceYuri Malenchenko, already a veteran of multiple spaceflights, had spent much of his professional life training and working away from home. Ekaterina Dmitriev, a US-based space enthusiast of Russian descent, had met him years earlier through mutual acquaintances in the aerospace field.Their relationship was a lesson in long-distance endurance. Malenchenko often trained in Star City, Russia, while Dmitriev lived in the United States. They sustained their romance through phone calls, occasional visits, and a shared passion for space exploration. The couple initially planned a traditional wedding with 200 guests in attendance. But when Malenchenko’s mission aboard the ISS was unexpectedly extended, postponing the wedding by months or even years, they faced a choice—delay the marriage or find a way to bridge the gap.They chose the latter. After securing approval from Russian space authorities, they planned what became the first and only marriage ceremony conducted from space.Inside the International Space Station’s first-ever wedding ceremonyConducting a wedding between space and Earth involved complex coordination between Roscosmos (Russian space agency) and NASA. The ISS’s Ku-band communication system was used to transmit live video and audio between the spacecraft and mission control.Key elements of the ceremony:Visual connection: Dmitriev stood in a decorated room at NASA’s Houston facility, while Malenchenko appeared live on a monitor from the ISS.Dress code: Malenchenko wore his formal Russian space suit with a bow tie as a symbolic gesture. Dmitriev wore a traditional ivory wedding gown.Music in orbit: Astronaut Ed Lu, serving as Malenchenko’s best man, played the wedding march on a small keyboard aboard the ISS.Cultural touches: Dmitriev walked down the aisle to David Bowie’s “Space Oddity”, linking the ceremony to space pop culture.Symbolic gestures: The bride blew a kiss toward the camera, and the groom reciprocated from orbit.From orbit to Earth: The reunion after the first wedding in spaceEkaterina Dmitriev later told the New York Times that, “As Yuri was further away, he was closer to me because of the communication we have.” She called the orbital wedding a reflection of “mankind’s desire and need to go one step further.”Marriage became a symbol of human adaptability—proving that even in the most extreme environments, people find ways to preserve traditions and emotional bonds. It also captured the imagination of the public, blending romance, technology, and exploration in a single event. Following the ceremony, Malenchenko continued his ISS duties for several months. In October 2003, he returned to Earth, finally meeting his wife in person as her husband. Photographs of their reunion marked the end of one of the most remarkable long-distance weddings in history.Also Read | 4.56-billion-year-old McDonough meteorite older than Earth crashes into Georgia home; stuns scientistsAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

These structures, thousands of light-years across, are potential star birthplaces, possibly formed from the Milky Way's spiral arms. The discovery, enabled by advanced mapping, reveals a galactic framework influencing star formation and galactic evolution, opening new avenues for astronomical research. Source: ScienceNews In a stunning breakthrough, astronomers have discovered seven massive structures of gas known as superclouds just beyond our solar system. These immense clouds, stretching thousands of light-years across, are likely the birthplaces of stars and may have formed from material stripped from the spiral arms of the Milky Way. While two of them, including the well-known Radcliffe Wave, had been identified earlier, five are brand new discoveries. Lying nearly parallel to each other and undulating in wave-like patterns, these superclouds are our largest local neighbours in space and are rewriting what we know about interstellar structure and star formation.A hidden interstellar structure revealed by modern mappingThanks to advanced space mapping using data from the Gaia spacecraft, a team of astronomers led by Lilly Kormann from the University of Vienna has charted a detailed 3D map of interstellar dust and hydrogen within 50 million square light-years around the Sun. What they initially saw were patches of high-density dust, but a closer analysis revealed that many of these dense zones were linked together in long, coherent structures. By connecting the dots, the team identified seven vast superclouds, including the Radcliffe Wave and a previously known one called the Split, lying close to the solar system in an almost parallel arrangement.Colossal dimensions and massEach of the seven superclouds stretches between 3,000 and 8,000 light-years in length and holds gas weighing 800,000 to 3.5 million times the mass of the Sun. These massive forms are not only among the largest known local structures in our galaxy, but researchers believe they might be even larger than measured, as parts likely extend beyond the edges of the current dust map. Positioned along the Milky Way’s disc, these superclouds form a sort of galactic framework that may shape the way stars and star systems, including ours, are created and distributed across space.Star nurseries within the supercloudsWhat makes this discovery especially important is that most known stellar nurseries, regions where new stars are born, are located inside these superclouds, particularly along their central spines. This pattern strongly suggests that superclouds play a foundational role in star formation, acting as the “mothers” to smaller, denser gas clouds that collapse under gravity to form stars. Scientists now believe these superclouds represent an early stage in the hierarchy of star-making, offering insight into how vast structures break down into smaller ones, eventually producing stars, solar systems, and perhaps even planets like Earth.The mystery of the wavesMost of the superclouds show a distinct wave-like form, rising and falling in an undulating pattern above and below the flat disc of the Milky Way. Only one, the Split, remains relatively straight. The fact that so many of these gas clouds zigzag in unison suggests there’s a common physical mechanism shaping them, possibly linked to galactic gravity, spiral arm dynamics, or even external galactic forces. Even more intriguing is how their average densities remain strikingly similar, despite differences in the amount of material packed into each section. This hints at a larger, still-unknown system regulating their structure and behaviour.What this means for astronomyThis discovery marks a turning point in our understanding of the local interstellar medium, the cloud-like environment that surrounds our solar system. As astrophysicist Bruce Elmegreen put it, we are only now beginning to "see what is very local to us," after decades of struggling to separate nearby structures from distant background noise. The identification of these seven superclouds gives scientists a valuable new framework to study star formation, interstellar physics, and the evolution of our galaxy on a large scale. It also opens new questions about what other structures might still be hidden in the cosmic dust.Also read | New Hubble photo shows cotton candy-like nebula in a nearby dwarf galaxyAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Meteorite older than Earth smashes house roof in Georgia; scientists trace rock to asteroid belt - video
A meteorite fragment that crashed through a Georgia home's roof in June has been identified as being older than Earth. Originating from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, the rock formed 4.56 billion years ago. Scientists emphasize that studying such meteorites is crucial for planetary defense, potentially helping to prevent catastrophic impacts in the future.

Originating from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, the rock formed 4.56 billion years ago. Scientists emphasize that studying such meteorites is crucial for planetary defense, potentially helping to prevent catastrophic impacts in the future.  A meteorite fragment that tore through the roof of a Georgia home last June has been found to be older than Earth itself, according to scientists at the University of Georgia.Geologist Scott Harris told Fox News Digital that the rock, which fell on June 26 near Atlanta, originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Analysis shows it formed 4.56 billion years ago — slightly before the birth of the Earth, estimated at 4.54 billion years.A fiery descentEyewitnesses reported seeing a bright fireball streak across the sky that day. Harris was quickly called to investigate the home, where he traced the meteorite's dramatic path: A clean hole through the roof and an air ductPenetration through insulation and the ceiling Impact with the floor, leaving a crater the size of a large cherry tomatoPollHave you ever witnessed a meteor shower or meteorite fall?Yes, I haveNo, neverThe fragment hit with such force that part of it was pulverised "like somebody hitting it with a sledgehammer," Harris said. The rock briefly broke the sound barrier before impact.No danger this time — but a reminder for the futureWhile the small size of the meteorite posed no threat to the homeowners, Harris said studying such falls is crucial for planetary defence. Understanding how meteorites travel through space and into Earth's atmosphere could help scientists predict — and prevent — catastrophic impacts.He pointed to Nasa's DART mission as an example of potential defence, where a spacecraft successfully altered the path of an asteroid through kinetic impact."If you move an asteroid early enough, you can get it to avoid us altogether," Harris said.

This image provided by NASA shows, from left, NASA's SpaceX Crew-10 members JAXA  Four astronauts have safely returned to Earth after spending five months aboard the International space station (ISS). Their SpaceX capsule splashed down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California on Saturday, a day after leaving the orbiting laboratory.Nasa’s Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan’s Takuya Onishi, and Russia’s Kirill Peskov launched in March to replace the two Nasa astronauts stranded on Boeing’s Starliner following its failed test mission. “Welcome home,” Mission Control at SpaceX radioed as the capsule parachuted into the water.Starliner’s malfunctions forced Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to remain in orbit for more than nine months instead of a planned week. Nasa eventually ordered the capsule to return empty, transferring the pair to a SpaceX flight. Wilmore has since retired from Nasa.Before departure on Friday, McClain said, “We want this mission, our mission, to be a reminder of what people can do when we work together, when we explore together.” She said she was looking forward to “doing nothing for a couple of days” in Houston, while her crewmates hoped for hot showers and burgers.This was SpaceX’s first Nasa crew splashdown in the Pacific in 50 years, with Elon Musk’s company shifting returns from Florida to California earlier this year to reduce debris risks. The last Nasa astronauts to land in the Pacific were part of the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz mission, a historic joint effort between the US and the Soviet Union.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

This initiative supports the Artemis program and addresses the limitations of solar power in shadowed regions. Amidst growing international competition, this project aims to secure U.S. leadership in space and enable future Mars missions.  NASA has unveiled plans to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2030 as part of its Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the lunar surface and establish a sustainable presence. This ambitious move comes amid increasing international competition in space exploration, with countries like China and Russia developing similar nuclear-powered lunar projects. The reactor is designed to provide a continuous, reliable source of energy to power habitats, scientific instruments, rovers, and mining operations, especially during the Moon’s lengthy nights and permanently shadowed craters where solar power is ineffective.The development of this nuclear power system marks a crucial step toward creating the infrastructure necessary for long-term lunar habitation and resource utilization. Unlike previous missions that relied heavily on solar panels and limited battery storage, a nuclear reactor could enable round-the-clock operations and pave the way for deeper space exploration, including future missions to Mars.Why NASA wants to build a nuclear reactor on the MoonNASA has been quietly developing small nuclear power systems in collaboration with the Department of Energy for years. The plan is to deploy a small modular nuclear reactor capable of producing at least 100 kilowatts of electricity, enough to power about 80 homes on Earth. This reactor will provide continuous energy without interruption, a critical advantage over solar power, which falters during the Moon’s two-week-long nights.The Moon’s south pole is a particular focus due to its abundant water ice deposits, essential for life support and fuel production. However, these craters are permanently shadowed, receiving little to no sunlight, rendering solar energy impractical. The nuclear reactor will enable operations in these challenging environments, supporting scientific research, mining activities, and habitat life-support systems.NASA’s Acting Administrator Sean Duffy has emphasized the importance of this technology for Artemis’ goals, calling it a “game changer” for sustained lunar presence. The project is also seen as a testbed for technologies that could eventually support human missions to Mars, where solar energy is even less reliable.Geopolitical stakes and the race for lunar infrastructureThe push for a nuclear reactor on the Moon comes at a time of heightened geopolitical competition in space. China announced plans in 2025 to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2035, while Russia has also expressed ambitions in this domain. Establishing nuclear infrastructure is more than a technical achievement; it signals a country’s ability to exert influence and control over critical lunar regions.Under the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, no nation can claim sovereignty over the Moon or other celestial bodies. However, building infrastructure such as nuclear reactors and bases effectively sets “keep-out zones” around these installations. These zones grant operators significant control over access to nearby resources, like the valuable ice deposits at the lunar south pole, which could be used to produce rocket fuel and sustain life.Experts view NASA’s project as a strategic move to maintain U.S. leadership in space exploration and to shape international norms for the responsible and peaceful use of nuclear power beyond Earth. Transparency, adherence to international guidelines, and cooperation will be essential to prevent conflict and ensure that space remains a domain for peaceful exploration.Why nuclear power is essential for the future of space explorationSolar panels have powered numerous space missions successfully, but their limitations are becoming increasingly apparent as humans prepare for long-term habitation beyond Earth. The Moon’s long nights and shadowed craters present significant challenges for solar energy, while Mars’ greater distance from the Sun further reduces its effectiveness.A nuclear reactor on the Moon can provide a stable, high-density power source capable of supporting demanding applications such as 3D printing of habitats, life support systems, communication networks, and scientific experiments. It also reduces reliance on expensive and logistically complex resupply missions from Earth.While concerns about safety and radiation risks exist, NASA and international space agencies adhere to strict safety protocols. The use of radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) in past missions, such as the Voyager probes and Mars rovers, has demonstrated the feasibility and safety of nuclear power in space. The planned lunar reactor would be designed with containment and fail-safe measures to minimize risks.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Lovell's legacy extends beyond space exploration, marked by his post-NASA career and lasting honors. Source: NASA James A. Lovell Jr., the famed astronaut and commander of NASA’s Apollo 13 mission, has died at 97. Lovell passed away on August 8, 2025, in Lake Forest, Illinois, his family confirmed in a statement to NASA. Though Lovell never walked on the Moon, his leadership during Apollo 13’s near-disastrous oxygen tank explosion turned the mission into one of space exploration’s greatest rescue stories. His calm, quick thinking under intense pressure saved the lives of his crew and inspired millions worldwide. Lovell’s heroism was immortalized in the 1995 film Apollo 13, where Tom Hanks portrayed him. Beyond his space legacy, Lovell remains a symbol of resilience and courage, admired by generations of astronauts, scientists, and space enthusiasts alike, continuing to inspire future exploration.Jim Lovell’s early life and path to NASABorn March 25, 1928, in Cleveland, Ohio, James Arthur Lovell Jr. lost his father at a young age and was raised in Milwaukee by his mother. Fascinated by rocketry as a teenager, he even built a homemade gunpowder rocket—a passion that eventually shaped his career.After attending the University of Wisconsin–Madison for two years, Lovell entered the US Naval Academy, graduating in 1952. He went on to become a Navy test pilot before being selected in 1962 as part of NASA’s second group of astronauts, destined for the Gemini and Apollo programs.Jim Lovell record-breaking space career before Apollo 13Before Apollo 13, Lovell already held the record for most hours in space among astronauts of the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo eras—logging over 715 hours.Gemini 7 (1965) – Flew with Frank Borman on a 14-day mission, achieving the first space rendezvous.Gemini 12 (1966) – Commanded the final Gemini mission with Buzz Aldrin, demonstrating critical spacewalking techniques.Apollo 8 (1968) – Served as command module pilot on the first human mission to orbit the Moon, delivering the famous “plaster of Paris” description of its surface and witnessing the iconic Earthrise photograph.By the time Apollo 13 launched, Lovell was one of NASA’s most experienced astronauts.Jim Lovell, Apollo 13 mission journey Apollo 13 spacecraft damaged: The oxygen tank blast that changed NASA historyApollo 13 lifted off on April 11, 1970 with Lovell as commander, Fred W. Haise Jr. as lunar module pilot, and John L. “Jack” Swigert Jr. as command module pilot. The plan was for Lovell and Haise to land in the Fra Mauro highlands while Swigert orbited above.But 56 hours into the mission, roughly 200,000 miles from Earth, disaster struck. An oxygen tank in the service module exploded after a damaged wire ignited during a routine stir. The blast crippled the spacecraft—knocking out power, oxygen, and water supplies. It was then that the phrase—misquoted in popular culture as “Houston, we have a problem”—entered the American lexicon. In reality, Swigert first radioed, “Houston, we’ve had a problem,” with Lovell repeating it shortly afterward.Apollo 13 crisis management: How the lunar module saved the crewWith the main command module crippled, the astronauts and NASA engineers devised an audacious survival plan—use the lunar module (LM) as a lifeboat. Designed for only two astronauts for two days, the LM now had to sustain three astronauts for four days.To conserve resources, they:Powered down lights, heaters, and non-essential systemsEndured cabin temperatures of 38°F (3°C)Survived on minimal rations, including hot dog packets for moistureBuilt a makeshift carbon dioxide filter from duct tape, plastic bags, and a sock to keep the air breathableAn immediate return to Earth was too risky, so Apollo 13 looped around the Moon for a slingshot trajectory home. Lovell manually guided crucial rocket burns using Earth’s position through the spacecraft window as a navigation point.Apollo 13’s safe return: From ocean rescue to Presidential honourOn April 17, 1970, after one of the most tense survival stories in modern history, Apollo 13 splashed down safely in the Pacific Ocean, 610 miles southeast of American Samoa. Three orange-and-white parachutes signaled the end of the crisis. President Richard Nixon awarded Lovell, Haise, and Swigert the Presidential Medal of Freedom, calling the mission “a successful failure”—failed in its lunar landing but victorious in its safe return.Lovell co-authored the 1994 book Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13 with Jeffrey Kluger, which became the basis for Ron Howard’s hit film Apollo 13. In the movie, Tom Hanks played Lovell, immortalizing his calm leadership for a new generation.Lovell even made a cameo as the captain of the USS Iwo Jima, the recovery ship that retrieved the Apollo 13 crew.James Lovell’s life After NASA: Leadership, family, and lasting honoursLovell retired from NASA and the Navy in 1973, going on to lead the Bay-Houston Towing Company and hold senior roles in telecommunications. He also ran Lovell Communications, a Chicago-based consulting firm. His family operated a Lake Forest restaurant decorated with space memorabilia until it closed in 2015. Lovell is survived by his four children—James III (Jay), Jeffrey, Barbara, and Susan—11 grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren. His wife of more than 60 years, Marilyn Lovell, died in 2023.In addition to the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Lovell was awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor by President Bill Clinton in 1995. In later years, Lovell often reflected that while missing the Moon was a disappointment, Apollo 13’s rescue was a greater triumph.“It was a triumph in a different direction—getting people back from a certain catastrophe,” he said.Also Read | NASA Hubble Space Telescope captures image of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS speeding at 130,000 mphAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

The cause of death was not immediately disclosed.Lovell was a pioneering figure in human spaceflight, being the first astronaut to make four spaceflights and logging over 715 hours in space. Before Apollo 13, he flew on the Gemini 7, Gemini 12, and Apollo 8 missions. Apollo 8, which orbited the moon without landing, made Lovell the first person to see the moon up close twice, reported CNN.During the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission, Lovell commanded the crew alongside astronauts John Swigert Jr and Fred Haise Jr. About 200,000 miles from Earth, an oxygen tank in their service module exploded, crippling their power and life support systems. Lovell famously informed mission control, “Houston, we’ve had a problem.”With their lunar landing abandoned, the crew had to perform critical engine burns to loop around the far side of the moon and set a course back to Earth. After a tense journey, they splashed down safely in the South Pacific Ocean about three days later. The mission became known as the “successful failure” of the Apollo program.The dramatic story of Apollo 13 was later portrayed in Ron Howard’s 1995 film, “Apollo 13.”Lovell’s family released a statement requesting privacy and said they were “saddened to announce the passing of our beloved father, USN Captain James A ‘Jim’ Lovell, a Navy pilot and officer, astronaut, leader, and space explorer.” They added, “We are enormously proud of his amazing life and career accomplishments, highlighted by his legendary leadership in pioneering human space flight. But, to all of us, he was Dad, Granddad, and the Leader of our family. Most importantly, he was our Hero.”Acting Nasa administrator Sean Duffy praised Lovell’s legacy, saying his “calm strength under pressure helped return the crew safely to Earth and demonstrated the quick thinking and innovation that informed future Nasa missions.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Momentum sagging at UN plastic pollution treaty talks
Talks on forging a landmark treaty to combat the scourge of plastic pollution were stumbling Saturday, with progress slow and countries wildly at odds on how far the proposed agreement should go. The talks are mandated to look at the full life cycle of plastic, from production to pollution, but some countries are unhappy with such a wide scope.

The talks are mandated to look at the full life cycle of plastic, from production to pollution, but some countries are unhappy with such a wide scope. Representative image GENEVA: Talks on forging a landmark treaty to combat the scourge of plastic pollution were stumbling Saturday, with progress slow and countries wildly at odds on how far the proposed agreement should go.The negotiations, which opened on Tuesday, have four working days left to strike a legally-binding instrument that would tackle the growing problem choking the environment.In a blunt mid-way assessment, talks chair Luis Vayas Valdivieso warned the 184 countries negotiating at the United Nations that they had to get shifting to get a deal."Progress made has not been sufficient," Vayas told delegates."A real push to achieve our common goal is needed," the Ecuadoran diplomat said, adding that Thursday was not a just deadline but "a date by which we must deliver."Some articles still have unresolved issues and show little progress towards reaching a common understanding," Vayas lamented.The key fracture is between countries that want to focus on waste management and others who want a more ambitious treaty that also cuts production and eliminates use of the most toxic chemicals.And with the talks relying on finding consensus, it has become a game of brinkmanship.A diplomatic source told reporters that many informal meetings had been scrambled together for Sunday's day off to try and break the deadlock."If nothing changes, we won't get there," the source added.Battle of the bracketsCountries have reconvened in Geneva after the failure of the supposedly fifth and final round of negotiations in Busan, South Korea in 2024.After four days of talks, the draft text has ballooned from 22 to 35 pages -- with the number of brackets in the text going up near five-fold to almost 1,500 as countries insert a blizzard of conflicting wishes and ideas.The talks are mandated to look at the full life cycle of plastic, from production to pollution, but some countries are unhappy with such a wide scope.Kuwait spoke up for the so-called Like-Minded Group -- a nebulous cluster of mostly oil-producing nations which rejects production limits and wants to focus on treating waste."Let us agree on what we can agree. Consensus must be the basis of all our decisions," Kuwait insisted.Nudging in the same direction, Saudi Arabia, speaking for the Arab Group, said the responsible way ahead was to start considering what bits of the text "may not make it to the final outcome due to irreconcilable divergence".But given how little is truly agreed on, Uruguay warned that consensus "cannot be used as a justification to not achieve our objectives".Eirik Lindebjerg, global plastics adviser for the World Wide Fund for Nature, told AFP that the Like-Minded Group's proposal was "another attempt to make it a waste management agreement", and to stifle talks on reducing the amount of plastic in circulation.Path through the fogThe UN Environment Programme is hosting the talks and swiftly called a press conference after the stock-take session.UNEP executive director Inger Andersen said a deal was "really within our grasp, even though today it might not look so"."Despite the fog of negotiations I'm really encouraged," she told reporters, insisting: "There is a pathway to success."Vayas added: "We need to accelerate. We need a better rhythm in this and we need to also work in such a way that it will be clear that we will deliver by the end."Afterwards, Bjorn Beeler, executive director at IPEN, a global network aimed at limiting toxic chemicals, told AFP: "This whole process has not been able to take decisions and is still collecting ideas. We're sleepwalking towards a cliff and if we don't wake up, we're falling off."'Profits from poisoning'Plastic pollution is so ubiquitous that microplastics have been found on the highest mountain peaks, in the deepest ocean trench and scattered throughout almost every part of the human body.More than 400 million tonnes of plastic are produced globally each year, half of which is for single-use items.Plastic production is set to triple by 2060.Panama's negotiator Juan Monterrey Gomez took the floor to slam those countries wanting to stop the treaty from encompassing the entire life cycle of plastic.He said microplastics "are in our blood, in our lungs and in the first cry of a new-born child. Our bodies are living proof of a system that profits from poisoning us". "We cannot recycle our way out of this crisis."End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksGlobal Standard indexUS stocks todayIndia-US tariffIntel CEOMukesh AmbaniUS jobless dataRussia crude oilTop TrendingTyreek HillSelena GomezKim KardashianTaylor SwiftTravis KelceBill Belichicks GirlfriendNBA Trade RumorsDwyane WadesShannon SharpeMike VrabelTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteTyreek Hill, ex Keeta Vaccaro rush baby Capri to ER;

Silopi, a city in the Sirnak province, is located around 10 kilometres from the Iraq and Syrian borders. It shattered the previous national high of 49.5 C recorded in August 2023 in the western province of Eskisehir. Turkey has faced weeks of scorching heat along with several wildfires. Fourteen people lost their lives battling blazes last month in the western part of the country. Hundreds of people were evacuated on Friday in the northwest province of Canakkale, where the busy Dardanelles Strait was closed to maritime traffic due to two raging fires.

Representative image (Image: AP) LAGRASSE: A wildfire in southern France slowed overnight into Wednesday after injuring nine people and burning through 11,000 hectares of vegetation, local officials said. The blaze, which started on Tuesday afternoon, is still threatening several villages in the aude department, where 1,500 firefighters have been battling to extinguish it."The fire is advancing in an area where all the conditions are ripe for it to progress. We are monitoring the edges and the back of the fire to prevent flare-ups," said Lucie Roesch, secretary general of the qude prefecture.She said firefighters are expecting to receive aerial support at dawn, but warned "this fire will keep us busy for several days. It's a long-term operation".The fire's advance slowed overnight due to high humidity levels, she added.One person was seriously burned and another injured, the prefecture said, adding that seven firefighters were also hurt. Camping grounds and one village were partially evacuated, and several local roads have been closed."All of the Nation's resources are mobilised," French president Emmanuel Macron said on X, while calling on people to exercise "the utmost caution".The qude department has seen an increase in areas burnt in recent years, aggravated by low rainfall and the removal of vineyards, which used to help break the progression of fires.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous10 beautiful and low-maintenance fishes for home aquariumsLifestyleKelley Mack: A look into the actress's most popular worksEntertainmentMalvi Malhotra redefines chic in THESE picsEntertainmentVitamins in broccoli: A, C, K, and more in one powerful veggieLifestyleJenna Ortega’s Wednesday promo looks redefine gothic glamourEntertainmentMegha Chakraborty’s Bubbly Fashion GametvKajal Raghwani blends tradition with charm in every graceful ethnic momentEntertainmentReduce dementia risk: 10 lifestyle changes that can protect your brainLifestyleUnmissable entry looks of Bigg Boss Malayalam 7 contestantstvPeshwai nath to Nathuli: Trendy hoop naths that deserve a place in your vanity boxLifestyle Next123 Photostories  The secret of Lingaraj: A temple where two gods dwell as oneBeyond Gangtok: 5 hill stations in Sikkim that redefine peace and serenity5 Foods that can work like natural laxatives and fix constipationUntold stories from Jaya Prada’s life and legacy7 smart ways for couples to split financesExploring wild side of Goa: 5 wildlife sanctuaries that are a treat to the senses6 Surprising Animals That Don’t Have Bones in Their BodiesThe best exercises to get rid of cellulite5 saree colours Rekha wears on repeat!What happens when you eat 2 apples a day and 5 simple breakfast recipes to try123Hot PicksRBI MPC MeetPatna Double Decker BridgeSpiceJetRBI MPC MeetRussia OilUS China TradeNSDL IPO allotmentTop TrendingTrinity RodmanDe'Aaron FoxConnor BedardDennis RodmanRussell WilsonMitch MarnersKirby DachMatthew TkachukConnor McDavidAdam RuzickaTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteBird slams into plane nose: Cabin filled with smoke mid-air; panic on Paris-bound flight — watchBaby bonus: China offers subsidy to boost birth rate; why 'lie flat' gen isn't convinced‘Remains hopeful’: Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs’ lawyer seeks Trump’s pardon; Combs to remain jailed till sentencing'I am going to exert my powers': Prosecute minors as adults?

AI image ALGIERS: At a beach near Algiers, brown algae native to the Pacific Ocean cover the golden sand, posing a threat to ecosystems native to the area and their stench repelling swimmers at the peak of summer.Following a recent government call to help clear beaches swarmed by the seaweed species known scientifically as Rugulopteryx okamurae, several volunteers and charities have stepped in."When it washes up, we can't swim," said Salim Hemmedi, a 43-year-old vacationer at a beach in Sidi Fredj, where volunteers raked up heaps of the plant."We hope the situation will improve so that we can enjoy ourselves... and that children can swim in peace."The alga originates from temperate waters around Japan and the Korean peninsula in the northwest Pacific Ocean.It was first spotted in Algeria in late 2023, according to Lamia Bahbah, a lecturer and researcher at the National School of Marine Sciences and Coastal Planning.And lately, some have noted that it has been increasingly washed ashore.Youcef Segni, a marine engineer and biologist, said the algae proliferated at a significantly higher rate than in 2023 and 2024."They invade the habitats of other algae in the seabed, which leads to the disappearance of some species," he said, adding that it can also displace some native fish.Fast reproductionIn France, Spain and Portugal, the Rugulopteryx okamurae species has also been observed.Earlier this year, Spanish football club Real Betis introduced kits repurposed from seaweed to raise awareness about the issue.A 2023 study by the Marine Drugs journal said the alga's invasive character led to "a replacement of the native biota and an occupancy rate that reached almost 100 per cent in some locations" in Portugal.In Algeria, the plant has been spotted in at least three of the country's 14 coastal provinces, including the capital where 16 beaches are affected, authorities said."Are the waters suitable for swimming? Yes," said Environment Minister Nadjiba Djilali during the cleanup campaign, adding there were no records of the plant causing allergies.Researcher Bahbah said stopping its proliferation was "unfortunately impossible at this stage".She said the plant reproduces at a high rate, both sexually and asexually.The species can reproduce through fragmentation, meaning new individual algae can develop from fragmented pieces of other Rugulopteryx okamurae algae.The algae spread mainly by clinging to the hulls of boats, and the Mediterranean's moderate temperature favours the seaweed's fast reproduction."We are going to fight it," said Fella Zaboudj, a state engineer in marine sciences, adding that researchers were monitoring its spread, development and evolution.Zaboudj said research was also underway to determine whether the algae could be repurposed as fertiliser.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksSibu SorenPatna Double Decker BridgeSpiceJetRBI MPC MeetRussia OilUS China TradeNSDL IPO allotmentTop TrendingTrinity RodmanDe'Aaron FoxConnor BedardDennis RodmanRussell WilsonMitch MarnersKirby DachMatthew TkachukConnor McDavidAdam RuzickaTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website'Will raise tariff substantially in 24 hours': Donald Trump fires fresh salvo;

Ireland's wind energy sector has long been touted as full of potential. AI image BANGOR: On Ireland's blustery western seaboard, researchers are gleefully flying giant kites, not for fun but in the hope of generating renewable electricity and sparking a "revolution" in wind energy."We use a kite to capture the wind and a generator at the bottom of it that captures the power," Padraic Doherty of Kitepower, the Dutch firm behind the venture, told AFP. At its test site in operation since September 2023 near the small town of Bangor Erris, the team transports the vast 60-square-metre (645,000-square-feet) kite from a hangar across the lunar-like bogland to a generator. The kite is then attached by a cable tether to the machine and acts like a "yo-yo or fishing reel", Doherty said."It gets cast out and flies up, the tether pulls it back in, over and over again, creating energy," he said, testing the kite's ropes and pulleys before a flight.The sparsely populated spot near the stormy Atlantic coast is the world's first designated airborne renewable energy test site. And although the idea is still small in scale, it could yet prove to be a mighty plan as Ireland seeks to cut its reliance on fossil fuels such as oil and gas."We are witnessing a revolution in wind energy," said Andrei Luca, operations head at Kitepower, a zero-emissions energy solutions spin-off from the Delft University of Technology."It took nearly 25 years for wind turbines to evolve from 30-kilowatt prototypes to megawatt scale, and decades to offshore wind farms we see today," he added.The system flies autonomously, driven by software developed at the university in the Netherlands, but Doherty acts as the kite's "pilot" on the ground, monitoring its flight path for efficiency. The kite flies up around 400 metres (1,300 feet) and reels in to about 190 metres, generating around 30 kilowatts for storage.The force spins "like a dynamo on a bike", Doherty said, adding that "it generates up to two and a half tonnes of force through each turn".The electricity is stored in batteries, similar to solar photovoltaic systems, with the kite currently able to fully charge a 336-kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery."That's a meaningful amount of energy, sufficient for powering a remote outpost, a small island, polar station, or even a construction site," Luca said."Add additional kites and we can power a bigger island."'Mobile, flexible'According to Doherty, a chief advantage of the kite system is its flexibility and swift start-up capability."We can set up in 24 hours and can bring it anywhere, it's super mobile, and doesn't need expensive, time- and energy-consuming turbine foundations to be built," he said. A kite system is "way less invasive on the landscape (than wind turbines), produces clean energy and doesn't need a supply chain of fuel to keep running", Luca added.During January's Storm Eowyn, which caused widespread and long-lasting power outages in Ireland, the system showed its value in Bangor Erris, according to Luca. "Paired with a battery, it provided uninterrupted electricity before, during and after the storm," he said. Ireland's wind energy sector has long been touted as full of potential.But progress on large-scale delivery of onshore and offshore turbines has been held up by planning delays and electricity grid capacity constraints.The Irish government has set ambitious targets for offshore wind energy to deliver 20 gigawatts of energy by 2040 and at least 37 gigawatts by 2050.In 2024, Irish wind farms provided around a third of the country's electricity according to Wind Energy Ireland (WEI), a lobby group for the sector. This compares to the UK, where, according to trade association RenewableUK, wind energy from the country's combined wind farms first reached 20 gigawatts in November 2022.The ability of airborne wind energy (AWE) systems to harness high-altitude winds with relatively low infrastructure requirements "makes them particularly suitable for remote, offshore or mobile applications," Mahdi Salari, an AWE researcher at University College Cork, told AFP.But he said Kitepower would face challenges on "regulation, safety, and system reliability". Such technology however could plug gaps in places where "land availability, costs or logistical constraints hinder the deployment of traditional wind turbines", Salari said.By the 2030s, he said: "I expect AWE to contribute meaningfully to diversified, flexible and distributed renewable energy networks".Discover stories of India’s leading eco-innovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksSibu SorenPatna Double Decker BridgeSpiceJetGold Price PredectionRussia OilUS China TradeNSDL IPO allotmentTop TrendingRussell WilsonHailee SteinfeldsF1 StandingsDez BryantLebron James WifeRussia Oil ImportsTriple HPrince HarryRJ MahvashAntonio BrownTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteBrooke Hogan’s husband: Hulk Hogan showed no interest in meeting grandkidsDak Prescott builds new mansion, reveals why he razed the last oneTaylor Swift’s Kelce jacket inspires Kristin Juszczyk’s new NFL lineGabrielle Union on menopause: 'It makes it hard' — motherhood now more emotional, exhaustingGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai to employees: ‘I think we have to....'Apple CEO Tim Cook confirms: Majority of new iPhones sold in the US are 'made' in India;

Aalborg Zoo in Denmark is now accepting unwanted small pets as donations to feed its predators. The zoo assures that donated animals like rabbits and guinea pigs will be humanely euthanized before being used as food. This initiative aims to mimic the natural food chain, promoting animal welfare and natural behaviour among captive carnivores.

This initiative aims to mimic the natural food chain, promoting animal welfare and natural behaviour among captive carnivores. (Ai generated image)  If you have a pet you can no longer keep, one zoo in Denmark is offering an unusual option.Aalborg Zoo is asking the public to donate small pets — not for rehoming, but to be used as food for its captive predators.Aalborg Zoo, located in northern Denmark, said in a Facebook post that the move is meant to mimic the natural food chain of animals housed there. The zoo says this effort supports “animal welfare and professional integrity,” and assures that any donated pets will be “gently euthanized” by trained staff.“If you have a healthy animal that needs to be given away for various reasons, feel free to donate it to us,” the post said.The zoo lists rabbits, guinea pigs, horses and chickens as examples of suitable donations.PollWhat do you think about Aalborg Zoo's practice of accepting pets for food for predators?Support it for animal welfareOppose it, find other solutionsOnce euthanised, the animals will be used as fodder for the zoo’s carnivores.“That way, nothing goes to waste — and we ensure natural behaviour, nutrition and well-being of our predators,” the zoo claimed.The post is accompanied by a picture of a wildcat showing its teeth with its mouth wide open. It also includes a link to the zoo’s website.About the zoo Aalborg Zoo was founded in April 1935. The facility is located near the centre of Aalborg and spans 8 hectares. It houses more than 1,500 animals across 126 species and draws hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.According to the zoo’s official website, Aalborg Zoo focuses on conservation, sustainability and education.It takes part in international breeding programmes for endangered species and supports global efforts in animal conservation, research and fair trade. It was also the first zoo in Denmark to receive an environment certificate and is known for its work in protecting nature and the environment.The zoo maintains that the practice of using donated pets as prey aligns with its mission to support natural behaviours in captive predators.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

LISBON: Portugal's government on Saturday issued an alert warning of a heatwave with a high risk of fires in large parts of the country in the coming days.The alert, covering Sunday to Thursday, included a ban on bonfires, fireworks and the use of electrical equipment in forests.The authorities also restricted access to some woodland areas, announced a boost in staffing for the forest ranger service and increased land and air patrols in high fire-risk areas."The next week will be difficult" said Home Affairs Minister Maria Lucia Amaral.Both Portugal and neighbouring Spain have had to battle wildfires in the recent days, a problem they and other countries face every year.Experts say climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of droughts and fires around the world.Following the deadly fire season in 2017, Portugal ramped up its spending on wildfire prevention and response. More than 29,000 hectares (71,600 acres) have already been destroyed by fire since the beginning of the year, according to Portugal's Institute of Forests (ICNF).End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous'Kingom' actor Vijay Deverakonda’s stylish looksEntertainmentVijay Deverakonda’s fitness workout routineEntertainmentTop 10 colour-changing birds of IndiaLifestyleRaksha Bandhan-worthy mehendi designs to try this yearLifestyle10 things to know before getting an Arowana fish for good luckLifestyleMouni Roy’s top 10 gorgeous ethnic lookstvPriya Prakash Varrier serves fierce fashionEntertainmentSouth Actresses dazzle in this week's best photosEntertainmentMost popular baby names of 2024Lifestyle9 Ayurvedic habits to regulate the nervous systemLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Bigg Boss Malayalam 7 contestants Adhila and Noora: All about the lesbian couple who fought a legal battle for loveWhen fame faded Mahima Chaudhry chose to fight not fall5 snake parks in India that are absolutely fang-tastic and what makes them special5 things to know before drinking water in a copper bottleBigg Boss Malayalam 7 contestant Rena Fathima: Who is this 19-year-old influencer?From ‘DDLJ’ to ‘Saiyaara’: 5 Bollywood love stories that gave us hopeful, happy endingsHollywood's 7 BFFs whose friendship stood the test of timeThe Great Indian Kapil Show: From a luxurious house in Madh Island worth approximately Rs 12 crore to net worth, car collection; Archana Puran Singh’s lavish life'Coolie' audio launch highlights: Star-studded speeches, roaring cheers & a grand tribute to Rajinikanth—everything you should not missFrom Thummanpeta to Stardom:Meet the family behind Vijay Deverakonda’s stardom123Hot PicksKamala HarrisIndian NavyJ&K landslideTrump TariffsUPI New RulesGST collectionsJulia HymanTop TrendingWWE Summerslam HighlightsHailee SteinfeldsTop Richest Billionaries in the worldEarthquake VideoLebron James WifeRJ MahvashGerman Influencer BengaluruKannada signboard ruleNayara EnergyIndia US Crude OilTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteHailee Steinfeld's latest workout photos break the internetGabrielle Union on menopause: 'It makes it hard' — motherhood now more emotional, exhaustingIND vs ENG Live: India need eight wickets to level the series 2-2Who is Matt Deitke?

Video/PTI NEW DELHI: Continuous heavy rainfall on Saturday brought large parts of Bihar’s capital Patna to a standstill, causing severe waterlogging and traffic congestion. Visuals from Kurji Road and other low-lying areas showed flooded streets, traffic jams, and pedestrians struggling to navigate waterlogged roads.Kerala Hit by Earliest Monsoon Since 2009 | IMD Predicts Above-Normal Rainfall for 2025The flood-like situation disrupted normal life and exposed administrative lapses in monsoon preparedness. Despite repeated assurances by civic authorities about improved drainage systems and better planning, the city appeared unprepared once again.Commuters faced long traffic jams in various parts of the city, as vehicles were stuck or slowed down due to waterlogging. Pedestrians were seen wading through flooded roads with extreme caution, fearing open manholes, uncovered drains, and the threat of electric shocks from submerged wires and poles.PollWhat do you think is the biggest issue causing urban flooding during monsoon?Poor drainage systemsLack of planning and maintenanceMeanwhile, the India Meteorological Department has predicted heavy rainfall in the region over the next few days.Moreover, contaminated water triggered a diarrhea outbreak in Bihar's Jehanabad.

House razings to save Niger capital's forest shield dismay locals
Hamissou Issiakou grumbled as he worked to strip bare his house, marked for demolition for illegally encroaching on the tip of green forest that's keeping the expanding desert at bay from Niger's capital. Director General of Water and Forests within the environment ministry Yacouba Seybou said on state television that since 2004 "decrees have prohibited housing in the (green) belt".

Director General of Water and Forests within the environment ministry Yacouba Seybou said on state television that since 2004 "decrees have prohibited housing in the (green) belt". Representative image (AFP) NIAMEY: Hamissou Issiakou grumbled as he worked to strip bare his house, marked for demolition for illegally encroaching on the tip of green forest that's keeping the expanding desert at bay from Niger's capital.His is one of nearly 500 homes being bulldozed as the authorities in the arid desert country, which is particularly at risk from man-made global warming, seek to shore up the wooded belt around Niamey's outskirts.Ukraine Launches MASSIVE Drone Attack On Russia; 3 Killed, Over 100 UAVs Shot Down"We've bought our plots of land at great expense. In the end it's a big waste," Issiakou told AFP, after urging workers to hurry up and remove an enormous gate before the police arrive. Since the heavy machinery began rolling in at the end of June, dozens of slums, luxury houses and apartment blocks have tumbled like a house of cards.Some homeowners have just stood by and watched in dismay as the bulldozers tore down their houses. Others, like Issiakou, have rushed to remove anything of value before the two-week notice period was up, from windows, metal sheets and electrical cables to small drinking water tanks and surveillance cameras.All say they bought their land from private real-estate agencies. - 'Submit to Allah' -In a country with one of the highest population growth rates in the world, the number of residents in Niamey has doubled since 2005, from 750,000 to one-and-a-half million, according to the national statistics institute. Thanks to that rapid urbanisation, the forest belt has lost more than half its area since it was completed in 1993 and now measures just 25 kilometres (16 miles) long and a kilometre wide. Hailing from various social classes, the woods' soon-to-be-gone inhabitants were originally attracted to the capital's outskirts by the good quality of life and reasonable cost of a plot. The distance from the bureaucracy within Niamey proper, which can often delay construction projects by years, did not hurt either. Thermos in hand, Aboul-Razak Moussa handed out coffee to the workmen using crowbars to dig up the cobblestones in the courtyard of his brand-new building."I bought the land for 12 million CFA francs ($21,000) and invested 127 million CFA francs (more than $220,000) to build my building," the owner of a welding company lamented."We submit ourselves to Allah." Businessman Ali Hamza was indignant."We're in the peak of the rainy season, it's inhuman," the father-of-10 argued. So far, at least 4,000 people have been evicted and nearly 500 homes, mostly slums, demolished, authorities say.- Rising temperatures -Carparks, petrol stations, pharmacies, shops, rubbish dumps and health centres sprung up to cater for those who made their home in the forested area.The project to introduce a green belt around Niamey is not part of the African Union's flagship Great Green Wall initiative, but its aims are the same.Landlocked Niger lies in the heart of the Sahel, a semiarid region stretching from Senegal to Sudan where temperatures are rising 1.5 times faster than the global average.At the same time, Niger suffers periods of drought and severe flooding.It is "imperative" that Niger "preserves more green spaces", Sani Ayouba, head of the Young Volunteers for the Environment NGO said.Director General of Water and Forests within the environment ministry Yacouba Seybou said on state television that since 2004 "decrees have prohibited housing in the (green) belt".Under the law, offenders face three months to two years in prison.Former ministers have "authorised private housing developments", Boubacar Maman, an official at the urban planning ministry, said.The environment ministry says a zoo and aquatic park as well as a botanic garden, sports and leisure area will soon be created within the forested green belt.bh/bam/bdi/sbk-kjm/yadEnd of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousTransform your boring sandals with trendy DIY embellishmentsLifestyleBhagyashri Borse's style statementsEntertainmentFrom Pulitzer to Orange: 10 prestigious awards given for LiteratureLifestyle10 veggies that can grow in containers in balconyLifestyle'Kingom' actor Vijay Deverakonda’s stylish looksEntertainmentVijay Deverakonda’s fitness workout routineEntertainmentTop 10 colour-changing birds of IndiaLifestyleRaksha Bandhan-worthy mehendi designs to try this yearLifestyle10 things to know before getting an Arowana fish for good luckLifestyleMouni Roy’s top 10 gorgeous ethnic lookstv Next123 Photostories  Top 6 zoos to visit across India for a complete wildlife experience10 minute daily habits that are perfect brain exercisesBigg Boss Malayalam 7 Contestant Aryan Kathuria: All about the handsome actor featured in a Poonam Pandey show6 healthy smart foods for babies when their teeth hurtFrom white themed rooms to aesthetic details: Debinna Bonnerjee’s living and bedroom give peaceful vibesHow to spend 5 days in Madhya Pradesh: The perfect Orchha–Khajuraho itineraryRisk of type 1 diabetes may depend on where childhood is spentBigg Boss Malayalam 7 contestant Abhisree: All about the actor-dancer with an inspiring journey5 filling foods under 50 calories7 key boundaries mentally strong people set to thrive at work123Hot PicksKamala HarrisIndian NavyJ&K landslideTrump TariffsUPI New RulesGST collectionsJulia HymanTop TrendingWWE Summerslam HighlightsHailee SteinfeldsTop Richest Billionaries in the worldEarthquake VideoLebron James WifeRJ MahvashGerman Influencer BengaluruKannada signboard ruleNayara EnergyIndia US Crude OilTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire Website'Disgraceful': Ex-South Korea president Yoon Suk Yeol resists questioning by laying down in underwear;

Southeastern Turkey is reeling under a record-breaking heatwave, with temperatures exceeding 50C in Silopi. Residents are struggling with soaring electricity bills due to constant air conditioning use and are appealing for state support. Deforestation and policy changes allowing mining on agricultural lands exacerbate the heat, intensifying the challenges faced by locals who depend on air conditioning as a necessity.

Residents are struggling with soaring electricity bills due to constant air conditioning use and are appealing for state support. Deforestation and policy changes allowing mining on agricultural lands exacerbate the heat, intensifying the challenges faced by locals who depend on air conditioning as a necessity. Representative Image  A choking heatwave left astonished locals in southeastern Turkey calling for state help to pay their air conditioning bills after the temperature surged past 50 degree celsius."We cannot cope with the heat," ice-cream maker Recep Esiyok, 59, told AFP in Silopi, where meteorologists measured 50.5C on Friday -- a national record."I've been living in Silopi for about 30 years. I've never seen such heat... I've never seen such heat anywhere."He is getting through the heatwave thanks to the air conditioner in his shop, but is now worried about paying for the electricity."My bill last month was 59,000 lira (1,450 dollars). We are asking for state support on this issue."'Incomparable' heat: Before Friday's record, the previous peak in Turkey had been 49.5 degree celsius in August 2023.Scientists agree that climate change caused by humans burning fossil fuels is increasing the likelihood, length and intensity of heatwaves."The heat has reached a point where it's incomparable to previous years," said Halil Coskun, 52, a local reporter.The country is still in the grip of the heatwave and since Sunday temperatures overall have surged from six to 12 degrees above seasonal norms, according to the state meteorology directorate.Wildfire threat: Turkey has fought fires in several regions since the start of the summer. Last week, 10 people perished while fighting a fire in Eskisehir province.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday the country has experienced drier conditions than normal over the past five years as a result of global warming."Extreme heat, low humidity, and strong winds are unfortunately increasing the risk of fire," he said.He said the state was using drones to monitor and protect forests.The streets were relatively empty and the atmosphere tense in Silopi, a Kurdish city whose main income is trade with Iraq across the border 10 kilometres (six miles) away."When it's hot, there's no one outside during the day," said Esiyok.Deforestation complaints: Other locals complained at the lack of vegetation to provide relief around the town, which lies at the foot of a mountain."Unfortunately, the forests here were burned in the past for security reasons," said Coskun.He said the Turkish army cleared them in the search for fighters from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a rebel group that recently disarmed.Turkey's parliament this month also passed a bill that opens certain agricultural lands including olive groves to mining activities, despite widespread opposition."We could at least minimise the heat by planting trees, not by felling them," Coskun said.Electricity bills: Sweating in his kebab shop, another local, Cemil Seher, said that summers in Silopi last not three months, but five.For Seher, 51, air conditioning is no longer a luxury but a necessity."AC is essential here as much as bread and water," he said."When the air conditioners are running, the electricity bills are very high," he said, demanding authorities offer discounts for businesses."I want a discount not only for Silopi but for the entire region from here to Sanliurfa" in the east, he said."I am not making a profit because I've been working... to pay my electricity bill."Discover stories of India’s leading eco-innovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksKamala HarrisBogota AirportUS Oil ReserveTrump TariffsUPI New RulesStarlink SatelliteJulia HymanTop TrendingTravis KelceTom BradyBengaluru Boy Kidnap MurderCBSE Class 10th Sample PapersHow new nep rule worksYuzvendra Chahal DatingStephen CurryJoe BurrowBlake LivelyTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website40 jobs AI can't touch in 2025, says Microsoft Research: Is your career on the list?Former PM HD Devegowda's grandson Prajwal Revanna convicted for raping 47-year-old domestic helpIND vs ENG Live: Rain likely to play spoilsport as India eye 300; Woakes ruled outUPI new rules 2025: New NPCI changes kick in from August 1 - All you need to knowSSC exam 2025 glitches spark massive nationwide protest: Here’s why #SSCMisManagement is trending on social mediaCAT 2025 registration begins at iimcat.ac.in: Check direct link to apply online hereAP Police Constable final result 2025 released at slprb.ap.gov.in; check direct link hereIs Yuzvendra Chahal dating RJ Mahvash?

Chinese sub discovers deepest-ever creatures 10 km undersea
A Chinese submersible has discovered thousands of worms and molluscs nearly 10 kilometres (six miles) below sea level in the Mariana Trench, the deepest colony of creatures ever observed, a study revealed on Wednesday. Last year, the Chinese submersible "Fendouzhe" -- or "Striver" -- dove 23 times into the depths of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean with researchers on board, according to the study in the journal Nature.

Last year, the Chinese submersible "Fendouzhe" -- or "Striver" -- dove 23 times into the depths of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean with researchers on board, according to the study in the journal Nature. AP file photo PARIS: A Chinese submersible has discovered thousands of worms and molluscs nearly 10 kilometres (six miles) below sea level in the Mariana Trench, the deepest colony of creatures ever observed, a study revealed on Wednesday.The discovery in Earth's deepest underwater valley suggests that there could be much more life thriving in the hostile conditions at the bottom of our planet's largely unexplored oceans than previously thought, the China-led team of scientists said.Almost all life on Earth is supported by light from the Sun. However, in the total darkness at the bottom of the world, these creatures live off of chemicals such as methane seeping through cracks in the seafloor, a process called chemosynthesis.Last year, the Chinese submersible "Fendouzhe", or "Striver", dove 23 times into the depths of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean with researchers on board, according to the study in the journal Nature.They found colonies of thousands of marine tubeworms and molluscs called bivalves at depths ranging from 2,500 to 9,533 metres (8,200 to 31,000 feet) deep. Video released alongside the study showed fields of tubeworms, which grew up to 30 centimetres (12 inches) long, as well as piles of molluscs and clams. Spiky crustaceans, free-floating marine worms, sea cucumbers, feathery-armed sea lilies and other invertebrates were also recorded in the depths.The study marked "the discovery of the deepest and the most extensive chemosynthesis-based communities known to exist on Earth," its authors said.Given that other ocean trenches are similar, "such chemosynthesis-based communities might be more widespread than previously anticipated," they added.The researchers said they also found "compelling evidence" that methane was being produced by microbes, with the tubeworms tending to cluster around microbial mats that resemble snow. Previous studies have found thriving communities of single-cell organisms on the ocean floor, but few large animals.But a remotely operated vehicle discovered tubeworms and other marine invertebrates living in hydrothermal vents in the crust below the seafloor two kilometres deep in the Pacific, research said last year.Pressure rising The new study was published as nations wrangle over the contentious issue of deep-sea mining. China, the United States and others have expressed interest in mining the depths for valuable minerals.Ocean scientists warn that mining the little-explored seafloor, one of the last wild zones on the planet, could decimate fragile ecosystems that are not yet well understood.Despite recent talks, the International Seabed Authority -- which oversees deep-sea mining in international waters -- has yet to adopt long-awaited rules governing the industry. Chinese media has previously reported that the Fendouzhe submersible mission will conduct research on "deep-sea materials".Only a handful of people have ever visited the bottom of the Mariana Trench, which is a crescent-shaped depression in the Earth's crust that is deeper than Mount Everest is high.The first explorers visited the trench in 1960 on a brief expedition.But after that, there were no missions until Hollywood director James Cameron made the first solo trip to the bottom in 2012, describing a "desolate" and "alien" environment.The water pressure at the bottom of the trench is a crushing eight tons per square inch, more than a thousand times the atmospheric pressure at sea level.Discover stories of India’s leading eco-innovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksKamala HarrisBogota AirportUS Oil ReserveTrump TariffsUPI New RulesStarlink SatelliteJulia HymanTop TrendingTravis KelceTom BradyBengaluru Boy Kidnap MurderCBSE Class 10th Sample PapersHow new nep rule worksYuzvendra Chahal DatingStephen CurryJoe BurrowBlake LivelyTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteSSC exam 2025 glitches spark massive nationwide protest: Here’s why #SSCMisManagement is trending on social mediaCAT 2025 registration begins at iimcat.ac.in: Check direct link to apply online hereAP Police Constable final result 2025 released at slprb.ap.gov.in; check direct link hereIs Yuzvendra Chahal dating RJ Mahvash?

Canada project reclaims 'foul' industrial area to contain floods

An aerial view of the Don River in the newly unveiled Biidaasige Park, part of Toronto's Port Lands Flood Protection Project, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (AFP photo) TORONTO: The spur to build Toronto's billion-dollar-plus flood prevention project dates back to a devastating hurricane in 1954, but planners say its urgency was reinforced by the recent tragic flooding in Texas.The Port Lands project has, in part, reversed a consequence of industrialization by reconnecting Lake Ontario with the Don River, more than a century after they were severed to create an industrial area.Chris Glaisek, chief planning officer at the municipal body Waterfront Toronto, said the idea was to "heal the land from the way it was repurposed 100 years ago," with a focus on "flood protection and naturalization."The complex project -- one of the largest in Toronto's history with a cost of Can$1.4 billion (US$1 billion) -- included digging a river valley and the creation of two new river outlets, with wetlands and marshes to absorb excess water during extreme storms.The mouth of the Don River was once the Great Lakes system's largest fresh water marsh, a rich habitat and vital food resource for Indigenous people before colonization.But Toronto, like many North American cities, saw industrial growth in the late 19th Century.Much of the marsh was drained and filled in to make room for a port industrial area, while the river was re-routed into a man-made channel. The Port Lands never thrived as an industrial area, leaving a vast stretch of eastern downtown under-used, and the Don River became polluted. "It was really dirty, it was foul, it was terrible," Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow said recently. - Hurricane Hazel -On October 15, 1954 Hurricane Hazel hit Toronto, after hammering parts of the Caribbean and eastern United States.It killed 81 people across the Greater Toronto Area and served as catalyst for the city to get serious about flood protection. Hazel flooded the Humber River, in western Toronto, but Glaisek said "it was understood at the time that that same amount of rainfall, had it landed on the (eastern) Don, would have done a comparable amount of damage." He called Hazel an initial "impetus" to re-naturalize the Port Lands, but rising awareness over the past two decades about the causal link between climate change and extreme floods helped advance the project. - 'Duty bound' -To reclaim the Port Lands, Toronto partnered with the US-based landscape architecture firm Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, which has worked on the Brooklyn Bridge Park and the Obama Presidential Center in Chicago.Laura Solano, the lead designer, said the project was "duty bound to address catastrophic flooding," but stressed it offered "much more."Because the area has been reformed to cope with flood waters, parts have been declared safe for new housing -- an urgent need in the expensive metropolis.There is also a new park, trails and people can canoe or kayak through the rehabilitated Don.Solano stressed Toronto's initial decision to alter the area was consistent with the times, when North American cities moved to "industrialize their waters...to raise their economic position."But now, "every city is looking to reclaim their waters," she told AFP. The Port Lands "shows the world that it's possible to fix the past and turn deficit and remnant industrial lands into living and breathing infrastructure."- 'The river is going to flood' -As Glaisek described the project, he stood on a bank that would, by design, be under water during a major storm."It's all planned so that it can flood, the water level can rise, the river can get about three, maybe four times wider than it is now, absorb all of that volume of water," he said. "When the storm event subsides, it will shrink back down to this."It's a planning approach that recognizes "we're seeing more and more of these events.""Like in Texas, you see very tragic outcomes when you haven't really tried to plan for nature," he told AFP, referring to flash floods in early July that killed at least 135 people. He urged planners to "reposition" their relationship to nature and ditch the mindset that "humans (can) control everything.""Let's acknowledge the river is going to flood.

Kanchan trees, nature-based solution to riverbank erosion in Majuli (Image: ANI) MAJULI: In the village of Pathorichuk, Majuli, Assam, local residents have discovered a remarkable way to combat riverbank erosion by planting Kanchan trees along the Brahmaputra River. This sustainable and eco-friendly approach has proven to be a natural shield against the relentless forces of erosion.Each year, the mighty Brahmaputra, along with its tributaries Subansiri and Kherkatia, relentlessly eats away at Majuli's landmass, threatening its very existence. Traditional anti-erosion measures such as RCC porcupines and geo-bags have only offered temporary relief and have largely failed to provide long-term protection.However, the residents of Pathorichuk have discovered a sustainable and local solution. By planting large numbers of Kanchan trees along the riverbanks, the village has managed to significantly reduce the impact of erosion in the area. The deep-rooted trees not only hold the soil together but also act as a natural barrier against the strong river currents.The success of Pathorichuk village presents a compelling case for the broader adoption of ecological methods to combat erosion. Locals now urge the government, administrative bodies, and concerned departments to consider the large-scale plantation of Kanchan trees across erosion-prone areas of Majuli.If replicated effectively, this eco-friendly and cost-effective model could play a key role in safeguarding Majuli, the world's largest river island, from further disappearance. While speaking to ANI, Nirab Tai, a local from Pathorichuk village, said, "We used to face heavy erosion in the past, and our village was constantly under threat. Around 20 years ago, our elders planted these trees to prevent erosion. Since then, the erosion has completely stopped, and our village is now safe. These trees are like blessings to us, they protect us. We call them "Kanchan trees" in Assamese.""I believe that if Kanchan trees are planted along the banks of the Brahmaputra River, there will be no erosion, and all the villages near the river will be protected. These trees grow very rapidly. You don't have to do much, just plant a branch of the Kanchan tree, and it will grow, especially quickly during the monsoon season. From a single tree, many more Kanchan trees will grow.The RCC porcupines used by the government to control erosion often get submerged during the monsoon season. But these trees are doing a tremendous job. They not only protect the land but also provide a healthy environment, shade, and natural beauty." Another local, Krishna Payeng, told ANI, "These trees grow from branches. When planted near rivers, they gradually grow massively and help control soil erosion. The government should consider this seriously. Along with geo bags, if we plant Kanchan trees, erosion can be effectively controlled."He suggested distributing these trees among students and highlighting their benefits on World Environment Day."These trees should be distributed among students, and they should be informed about their benefits. On World Environment Day, the positive impact of these trees should be highlighted. I sincerely request the government to look into this matter and plant Kanchan trees in areas highly affected by erosion, not only in our country, but across the world."The success of Pathorichuk village's initiative presents a compelling case for adopting ecological methods to combat erosion. By embracing nature-based solutions, we can protect the world's largest river island, Majuli, from further disappearance.

Early Hawaiian petroglyphs on a beach are visible again with changing tides and shifting sands
Ancient Hawaiian petroglyphs, featuring human-like figures, have resurfaced on Oahu's Waianae coast after years of being hidden by sand. Seasonal ocean swells revealed the panel of over two dozen images, dating back at least 500 years. Glen Kila, a Native Hawaiian cultural expert, believes this reappearance signals a message from ancestors about rising sea levels.

Seasonal ocean swells revealed the panel of over two dozen images, dating back at least 500 years. Glen Kila, a Native Hawaiian cultural expert, believes this reappearance signals a message from ancestors about rising sea levels. Early Hawaiian petroglyphs on a beach are visible again (Image: AP) WAIANAE: Hawaiian petroglyphs dating back at least a half-millennium are visible on Oahu for the first time in years, thanks to seasonal ocean swells that peel away sand covering a panel of more than two dozen images of mostly human-looking stick figures.  The petroglyphs are easy to spot during low tide when gentle waves ebb and flow over slippery, neon-green algae growing on a stretch of sandstone. This is the first time the entire panel of petroglyphs are visible since they were first spotted nine years ago by two guests staying at a bayside US Army recreation centre in Waianae, about an hour's drive from Honolulu. Native Hawaiian cultural practitioner Glen Kila, who traces his lineage to the aboriginal families of this coastal Hawaii community, said he believes the resurfacing of the traditional marvels are his ancestors sending a message. "It's telling the community that the ocean is rising," said Kila, a recognized expert on the local culture and history of Waianae who is consulting with the Army on the protection of the petroglyphs.  Army officials are trying to balance protecting the petroglyphs with their accessibility on a public beach.  John and Sandy Stone consulted tide charts and drove about 30 minutes from their home early Tuesday to get a glimpse after a watching a local TV report about the petroglyphs.  "It was so interesting to touch them," said John Stone, who splits his time between Hawaii and California. "It felt interesting to kind of have a connection with the past like that."  It is difficult to date petroglyphs, but an archaeological site in the area is from about 600 years ago, said Laura Gilda, an archaeologist with US Army Garrison Hawaii. According to Kila, Hawaiians arrived in Waianae at least 1,000 years ago.  Shift in waves caused petroglyphs to appear The beach here fluctuates in size and profile each year, with low-pressure weather systems that form in the eastern Pacific between May and November causing waves that cut away loose sand from shorelines and redeposit them further out, according to an Army report on the petroglyphs. That shift is likely what causes their temporary exposure.  Archaeologists identified a total of 26 petroglyphs. Of the 18 anthropomorphic stick figures, eight are depicted with possible male genitalia and the remainder are of undetermined gender, the report said.  The entire panel stretches about 115 feet (35 meters) long, Gilda said.  When the petroglyphs first reemerged in July 2016, it was after late spring and early summer storms, including hurricanes, with a lot of wave action that swept the sand away, Gilda said.  They remained visible for a period and then got covered again.  "So there's been portions that have ... been exposed since then, but this is the first summer that the whole panel has been exposed again," Gilda said.  Petroglyphs are telling a religious story, expert says Based on the teachings Kila learned, the lineal petroglyphs appear to be telling a religious, ceremonial story. He interprets the largest figure, which appears to include hands and fingers with one arm raised and the other down, to represent the rising and setting sun.  Kila said that when the military in the 1930s took over the area and evicted Native Hawaiians, including his family who lived there for generations, his great-great grandmother refused to leave so his family exchanged mountain lands with a coffee plantation so she could remain near the bay.  In an interview included in the Army's report, he recalled growing up in Waianae without television. So "the ocean and mountains were our playground," he said. The Army recreation centre was off-limits to the public, and the seawall was the barrier between Native Hawaiians and the military, Kila said.  Kila, now 72, recalled that if they walked on top of the wall, they were clubbed and pushed off by military police.  "We were proud and knew where we came from, so we never fostered any hatred for the military because one day we believed that the land will eventually return to us," he said.  Kila, while visiting the petroglyphs earlier this week, told The Associated Press that the Army's protection of them represents a shift in that community relationship.  Officials have been grappling with how to share the petroglyphs with the community while also protecting them, Gilda said.  "How much attention do you want to bring to this area?

That's according to the international sustainability organization Global Footprint Networkand York University in Toronto, Canada.The day, which is observed annually, comes just over a week earlier than last year's date— mainly due to the fact that oceans can absorb less CO2 than previously reported.We are overconsuming by depleting nature's capital faster than it can replenish, which is visible in deforestation, loss of biodiversity and the accumulation of carbon emissions in the atmosphere. And it is part of a trend that started back in the early 1970s.Mathis Wackernagel, co-founder of the Global Footprint Network, told DW that using too many resources is driving many "environmental ills," and that regularly using more than the planet can naturally reproduce has a cumulative effect. "Even if we keep it at the same level, we increase the ecological debt that the world endures," he said, adding that the ensuing "debt is measurable."Overconsumption is a global problemQatar, Luxembourg and Singapore were first in hitting their respective country overshoot days back in February. The US was not far behind. If everyone on the planet consumed like people in the US, resources would be depleted by March 13. Germany and Poland land on May 3, China and Spain on May 23, South Africa on July 2.Wackernagel said high income "typically leads to higher resource consumption," but added that it is not the only driver.Qatar, with a desert climate with low annual rainfall and intensely hot, humid summers, relies heavily on air conditioning powered by fossil fuel energy. "They have easy access to fossil fuels, so fossil fuel use is cheap and that has a big footprint," he said, adding the country also uses up a lot of resources for the energy intensive process of desalinating seawater.Uruguay, on the other hand, is not projected to start overconsuming until December 17. It has successfully turned to renewable energy to power its grid, relying mainly on hydroelectricity, wind and biomass.Sticking to what Earth can replenishAnd then there are the countries that stay within bounds of the planet's capacity such as India, Kenya and Nigeria, among others. In order to stay within our means, the world's ecological footprint would have to equal the available biocapacity per person on our planet, which currently stands at about 1.5 global hectares.Biocapacity is defined as land and ocean areas that provide resources such as food and timber, can accommodate urban infrastructure and absorb excess CO2. Anything higher than the global available biocapacity per person is overexploiting resources.Germany has about the same amount of biocapacity per person as the global average, but uses about three times more, Wackernagel said.While India, the world's most populous country, uses more than the country itself can renew in a year, globally speaking "the level of consumption is less than one planet," he said, adding that one planet should not be the goal. "There are also other species, so we should probably be below one planet to be robust."Decades of overusing are taking a tollWackernagel said we are taking resources "far beyond what Earth can regenerate" yet have a collective understanding that what we are doing is fine. "But we're fooling ourselves."Paul Shrivastava, co-president of think tank Club of Rome, said it's time to rethink how we understand economies. "We need to change from that extractive mindset of the economy to a regenerative one," he told DW."Mining is a kind of extraction. Oil is a kind of extraction. Once we take it out of the earth, we don't give anything back," he added.Wackernagel said it's not about what we need to give up, but rather how we can prepare ourselves for the future and what will be valuable then.Rather than adjusting economies to reduce overshooting, people are trying to squeeze the last bit out of the toothpaste tube, Wackernagel said."In the United States, where I live, I could see that many of the themes around the elections last year were very overshoot related. For example, the fear of not having enough energy," he said. However, the government has failed to address the problem of overshooting and instead pushed to "drill more holes and get more fossil fuels" out of the ground. How to push back Overshoot Day?The Global Footprint Network has outlined a number of solutions in five key areas to push back the date of Earth Overshoot Day.The energy sector is by far the biggest factor at play: Placing a price on carbon emissions that reflects the true cost of carbon pollution on the planet would help move the date by 63 days.Smart cities with integrated transport systems, advanced energy management and foresight through sensors to regulate energy in buildings could add another 29 days to the calendar.Replacing coal and gas-fired power plants with renewable energy such as solar and wind and generating 75% of electricity from low-carbon sources would move the date by another 26 days.Halving food waste would provide another 13 extra days and replacing 50% of global meat consumption with plant-based alternatives would add seven days from CO2 emissions and land use alone. Just one meatless day per week would add around two days.'Vested interests in maintaining the current system'"There are vested interests in maintaining the current system" such as in fossil fuels, said Shrivastava.And while individual changes such as eating less meat, favouring biking over car rides and vacationing closer to home rank comparatively low on the power of possibility chart, voters have the power to push for systemic changes."We don't control all of that individually, but we can have a say in it and we can talk to the people who have a say in it," said Shrivastava, by engaging in peaceful protests and in supporting local political candidates that have an ecological vision. Such changes will come from the power of the people, he added."Overshoot is the second-largest risk humanity faces this century," Wackernagel said. "The largest one is not to respond."End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksParliament Monsoon SessionRussia oil sanctionsICICI BankSovereign Gold BondsTCS new benching policyVibrio VulnificusLindsey GrahamTop TrendingShane Taylor RooksNFL NetworkLeBron JamesNHL Trade RumorsConnor McDavidChristian JarosShannon SharpeDwyane Wades WifeFOX Sports Analyst Cris CarterTravis HunterTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteRishabh Pant Injury Recap: ‘He was in a lot of pain’ — Watch dramatic video from Manchester Test'Surreal': Astronomer CEO speaks out about Andy Byron's Coldplay scandal, says company has now become a household nameBill Gates says: When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is ...“My body failed me”: Dwyane Wade’s wife Gabrielle Union opens up about facing “public humiliation” after choosing surrogacyWho is Bryan Johnson: Anti-aging champion who spent $2 million a year on his body now set to shut down or sell age-reversing startup due to financial lossesWorld's largest asset manager BlackRock to employees: You cannot carry your phones and laptops to China, instead …Solar Eclipse on August 2: Why world will be under darkness for over 6 minutes in a rare 100-year phenomenon; is it visible in India?Israel's key airport attacked: Houthi millitants launch missile at Tel Aviv; bombing destroys port's dock againLawsuit or ...: Why Astronomer has not fired HR head Kristin Cabot while CEO Andy Byron resignedWho is Connor Estelle?

Last year, 74% of the growth in electricity generated worldwide was from wind, solar and other green sources, according to the UN's multiagency report, called Seizing the Moment of Opportunity. It found that 92.5% of all new electricity capacity added to the grid worldwide in that time period came from renewables. Meanwhile, sales of electric vehicles are up from 500,000 in 2015 to more than 17 million in 2024. The three cheapest electricity sources globally last year were onshore wind, solar panels and new hydropower, according to an energy cost report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). Solar power now is 41% cheaper and wind power is 53% cheaper globally than the lowest-cost fossil fuel, the reports said. Fossil fuels, which are the chief cause of climate change, include coal, oil and natural gas. "The fossil fuel age is flailing and failing," United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in Tuesday morning speech unveiling the reports. "We are in the dawn of a new energy era. An era where cheap, clean, abundant energy powers a world rich in economic opportunity." "Just follow the money," Guterres said, quoting the reports that showed last year there was $2 trillion in investment in green energy, which is about $800 billion more than in fossil fuels. UN officials say switch to renewables needs to speed up Still, United Nations officials said the switch to renewable energy, while remarkable compared to 10 years ago, is not happening fast enough. The global renewables growth has been mostly in developed countries such as China - where one-tenth of the economy is tied up in green energy - as well as countries such as India and Brazil.  Yet Africa represented less than 2% of the new green energy capacity installed last year despite having great electrification needs, the reports said. United Nations officials blamed the high cost of capital for the Global South. "The Global South must be empowered to generate its own electricity without adding to already unsustainable level of debts," said Bahamian climate scientist Adelle Thomas of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Thomas, who did not work on the reports, added that they debunk the myth that clean energy cannot compete with fossil fuels, instead showing a clean energy future is not just possible but likely inevitable. The UN reports are "right on the money," said University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck, who also wasn't part of the studies. He said the economic tipping point leads to a cycle that keeps driving renewable costs down and makes fossil fuel power less and less desirable. Renewables grow despite high subsidies for fossil fuels And renewables are booming despite fossil fuels getting nearly nine times the government consumption subsidies as they do, Guterres and the reports said. In 2023, global fossil fuel subsidies amounted to $620 billion, compared to $70 billion for renewables, the UN report said. But just as renewables are booming, fossil fuel production globally is still increasing, instead of going down in response. United Nations officials said that's because power demand is increasing overall, spurred by developing countries, artificial intelligence data centers and the need for cooling in an ever warmer world. "A typical AI data center eats up as much electricity as 100,000 homes," Guterres said. "By 2030 data centers could consume as much electricity as all of Japan does today." So Guterres called on the world's major tech firms to power data centers completely with renewables by 2030. Solar and wind power face US cuts to renewable energy programs In the United States, solar and wind power had been growing at a rate of 12.3% per year from 2018 to 2023, the IRENA report said. But since President Donald Trump took office earlier this year, his administration has withdrawn the nation from the landmark Paris climate accord and cut many federal renewable energy programs, with a renewed emphasis on fossil fuels.  Guterres warned nations hanging on to fossil fuels that they were heading down a dangerous path that would make them poorer not richer, without naming the United States specifically. "Countries that cling to fossil fuels are not protecting their economies, they sabotaging them. Driving up costs. Undermining competitiveness. Locking in stranded assets," Guterres said. Renewables are the smart way to go for energy security, Guterres said. With renewables, he said, "there are no price spikes for sunlight. No embargoes on wind."

Meanwhile, the Philippines grapples with the aftermath of severe flooding, leaving thousands in shelters. Motorcyclists drive in the rain caused by tropical storm Wipha in Hanoi, Vietnam. (Picture credit: AP) HANOI: Tropical Storm Wipha made landfall in northern Vietnam on Tuesday, bringing strong winds and heavy rain to parts of the country's north and central regions.The storm came ashore at 10 am with sustained winds of 64-102 kilometres per hour (40-63 mph), and gusts up to 138 kph (86 mph), according to local weather officials. After landfall, it began moving southwest.Wipha was classified as a typhoon on Monday while over open water, but weakened overnight and was downgraded to a tropical storm before reaching land.The storm knocked out power in parts of Hung Yen Province, east of Hanoi. Residents rushed to gas stations to buy fuel for generators, state media reported.The streets of the capital city, Hanoi, were nearly empty as the storm moved inland. Most businesses were closed and the city government has advised residents to stay home and evacuate buildings that are unstable or in flood-prone areas."If the storm is serious, people shouldn't go out anyway because it would be dangerous on the road and there is also a chance of flooding," said Minh Doan, a taxi driver in Hanoi.Flights were cancelled across northern Vietnam, and airports in the port city of Hai Phong and Quang Ninh province were closed.Nearly 150,000 hectares (370,000 acres) of aquaculture farms and more than 20,000 floating fish cages are at risk from flooding and strong winds, according to state media.Vietnam has warned of flooding as heavy rain from Storm Wipha moves inland.In the Philippines, more than 80,000 people remain in emergency shelters after floods, landslides and tidal surges over the weekend.Most government offices and schools in the capital and 10 provinces were shut Tuesday due to widespread flooding from heavy monsoon rains, and droops evacuated residents from villages swamped by knee-to-waist-deep water while the coast guard deployed buses and boats to assist stranded commuters. At least three people have died.Global warming is making storms like Wipha stronger and wetter, said Benjamin P Horton, dean of the School of Energy and Environment at City University of Hong Kong. Warmer oceans give tropical storms more fuel, leading to more intense winds, heavier rain and shifting rainfall patterns across East Asia. "Rising sea surface temperatures, fueled by climate change, can intensify these storms," he said.

John Warmington mourns the loss of his beloved reef, now a coral graveyard. The International Court of Justice will advise on nations' climate obligations, a potential turning point for holding major emitters accountable. The once iconic Holiday Inn villas in Port Vila, Vanuatu, sit partially sunken, after being hit by multiple cyclones and an earthquake that caused irreparable damage. (Picture credit: AP) PORT VILA: When John Warmington first began diving the reefs outside his home in Vanuatu's Havannah Harbour a decade ago, the coral rose like a sunken forest - tall stands of staghorns branched into yellow antlers, plate corals layered like canopies, and clouds of darting fish wove through the labyrinth.  "We used to know every inch of that reef," he said. "It was like a friend." Now, it's unrecognisable. After Cyclone Pam battered the reef in 2015, sediment from inland rivers smothered the coral beds. Crown-of-thorns starfish swept in and devoured the recovering polyps. Back-to-back cyclones in 2023 crushed what was left. Then, in December 2024, a 7.3 magnitude earthquake shook the seabed.  What remains is a coral graveyard - bleached rubble scattered across the seafloor, habitats collapsed, life vanished. "We've come out of the water in tears," said Warmington, who has logged thousands of dives on this single reef. "We just see heartbreak." That heartbreak is becoming more common across this Pacific island nation, where intensifying cyclones, rising seas and saltwater intrusion are reshaping coastlines and threatening daily life. Since 1993, sea levels around Vanuatu's shores have risen by about 6 millimetres (0.24 inches) per year - significantly faster than the global average - and in some areas, tectonic activity has doubled that rate. International court to opine on nations' obligations to address climate change. On Wednesday, Vanuatu will get its day in the world's highest court. The International Court of Justice will issue an advisory opinion on what legal obligations nations have to address climate change and what consequences they may face if they don't. The case, led by Vanuatu and backed by more than 130 countries, is seen as a potential turning point in international climate law. "Seeing large, polluting countries just continue business as usual and not take the climate crisis seriously can get really sad and disappointing," said 16-year-old climate activist Vepaiamele Trief. "If they rule in our favour, that could change everything." The opinion won't be legally binding, but could help shape future efforts to hold major emitters accountable and secure the funding and action small island nations need to adapt or survive. It comes after decades of frustration for Pacific nations that've watched their homelands disappear. In Tuvalu, where the average elevation is just 2 meters (6.6 feet), more than a third of the population has applied for a climate migration visa to Australia. By 2100, much of the country is projected to be under water at high tide. In Nauru, the government has begun selling passports to wealthy foreigners, offering visa-free access to dozens of countries, in a bid to generate revenue for possible relocation efforts. "The agreements being made at an international level between states are not moving fast enough," said Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu's minister for climate change. "They're definitely not being met according to what the science tells us needs to happen." Vanuatu has already sought opinions from other international courts and is pushing for the recognition of ecocide - the destruction of the environment - as a crime under the International Criminal Court. "We have to keep fighting till the last bit," Regenvanu said.  How climate change is decimating Vanuatu. For children in Vanuatu, climate change isn't a theory - it's a classroom, or the lack of one. At Sainte Jeanne D'Arc school on Efate Island, elementary school teacher Noellina Tavi has spent two of the last three years teaching her students in tents - first after the 2023 cyclones and again following the 2024 earthquake.  With a shortage of emergency tents, her class was combined with another. Students fidget and lose focus. "It's too crowded," Tavi said. "We can't work peacefully." When it rains, the tents turn cold and muddy. Tavi often sends students home so they don't get sick. Anytime a storm approaches, the tents must be dismantled, the furniture carried to shelter and the children sent home. "That disrupts their education for a whole week," she said. In rural areas, extreme weather hits something even more basic: food security. On Nguna Island, farmer Kaltang Laban has watched cyclones wipe out the banana, cassava and taro crops that feed his community. "After a cyclone, we would have nothing for months," he said. Now, with support from Save the Children, Laban and other farmers are storing preserved fruits and vegetables in a facility beside their gardens. "But not every community has this," he said. More than 70% of Vanuatu's population lives in rural areas and depends on small-scale farming.  In 2025, USAID cut funding for a rainwater harvesting initiative designed to improve water access at cyclone evacuation centres in one of the country's most remote, drought-prone provinces, said Vomboe Shem, climate lead for Save the Children Vanuatu. The materials had already been shipped and distributed, but the project was halted. "These disasters are happening over and over again," Shem said. "It's pushing our communities to their limits." Not all of these impacts can be pinned solely on climate change, said Christina Shaw, CEO of the Vanuatu Environmental Science Society. Coastal development, tectonic sinking, volcanic eruptions, deforestation and pollution are also contributing to ecosystem decline. "Vanuatu's environment is quite fragile by its inherent nature in that it's young with narrow reefs, has small amounts of topsoil and is insulted regularly by natural disasters," she said. "But we do have to think about the other human impacts on our environment as well." The damage isn't limited to homes, gardens and reefs - it's reaching into places once thought to be untouchable. On the island of Pele, village chief Amos Kalsont sits at his brother's grave as waves lap against broken headstones half-buried in sand. At high tide, both his brother's and father's graves sit just a few arm's lengths from the sea. Some homes and gardens have already been moved inland, and saltwater intrusion has tainted the community's primary drinking water source. Now, the community is considering relocating the entire village - but that would mean leaving the land their grandparents cleared by hand. "The sea is catching up and we don't know what else to do," Kalsont said. "It's not fair that we have to face the consequences when we didn't contribute to this in the first place." Many in Vanuatu remain committed to building something stronger and hope the rest of the world will support them. "This is our future, and it's particularly our children's future, our grandchildren's future," said Regenvanu. "We just have to keep pushing for the best one we can." Back in Havannah Harbor, John Warmington still dives the reef he considers part of his family. While much of it is gone, he and his wife Sandy have begun replanting coral fragments in hopes of restoring what's left. "Our friend is still here," he said. "Life is coming back."

His fascination with drones began in 8th grade, and this passion has only deepened over the years. With a keen interest in pushing technological boundaries, Mehar embarked on a months-long project to build a drone capable of unparalleled vertical acceleration.“I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of pushing the limits of what drones can do,” Mehar explained. “But breaking a world record wasn’t just about the end result; it was about the process. I wanted to prove that current technology could achieve something extraordinary, but the path to get there was filled with challenges.”The project required Mehar to design, test, and refine multiple drone prototypes. “There were moments when I felt like I was chasing an impossible dream,” Mehar recalled. “I went through countless designs, and many of them failed during testing. Some drones crashed so badly that I had no choice but to go back to the drawing board and start from scratch. Each crash was a setback, but it also sparked new ideas and innovations.”Undeterred by the setbacks, Mehar poured his energy into creating a drone that was not only fast but also aerodynamically optimized. “I spent countless hours on CAD software, meticulously designing and tweaking each component. The goal was to make the drone as streamlined as possible, which led me to shape it like a rocket. This design wasn’t just about aesthetics; it was about reducing drag and maximizing speed.”Mehar’s dedication to his craft paid off in spectacular fashion. “Every failure taught me something valuable,” he said. “It forced me to think creatively and to consider every detail, from the materials used to the weight distribution of the drone. The process was grueling, but it was also incredibly rewarding to see my ideas take flight—literally.”This record-breaking achievement is more than just a personal triumph for Mehar; it has significant implications for the future of drone technology. “The possibilities are endless,” Mehar mused. “High-speed vertical acceleration could revolutionize everything from emergency response to space exploration. This isn’t just about setting a record; it’s about opening doors to new innovations and applications.”Mehar’s groundbreaking work has already begun to inspire others in the drone community and beyond. “I hope this accomplishment encourages other young innovators to push their own boundaries,” he said. “Technology is advancing rapidly, and there’s so much potential waiting to be unlocked. I’m excited to see where we can go from here.”As Mehar looks ahead, the sky is truly the limit. With his record-breaking drone, he has not only made history but also set the stage for future breakthroughs in drone technology. And for this young innovator, this is just the beginning of an exciting journey into the future of flight.Disclaimer: Content produced by Mediawire on Behalf of Shweta SinghEnd of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaTop TrendingAllen IversonCam SkatteboLebron JamesDwyane WadeSharmishtha PanoliDerrick HenryTurkish Airlines DGCA warningBrad MarchandWhere to Watch NBA FinalBengaluru NewsTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteTrump ally Laura Loomer says Republican law makers wondering if they should side with President Trump or Elon Musk; Tesla CEO responds: Trump has 3.5 years left as President, but I ...Rise in COVID-19 Cases: 7 essential medical gadgets for home useThis is likely Elon Musk’s ‘Most Read’ tweet on Donald TrumpIt's War out there: Donald Trump says very disappointed with Elon Musk; Tesla CEO respondsKeep EV subsidies with you, but ..., says Very Angry Elon Musk to Donald TrumpRobots could soon replace humans to deliver your Amazon ordersAsus launches a mouse that literally makes work smell betterHow Steve Ballmer may have just agreed with Android co-founder for Bill Gates being responsible for Microsoft losing $400 billion-plus in smartphone warPoland's biggest game developer brings cyberpunk 2077 to Nintendo for the first timeMumbai's second Apple Store likely to open in Borivali: Rent, lease period and other details revealed‘Her laptop is still on the office table, but she is not’: Bengaluru techie dream ends in grief"Not knowing Calvin is wild": New York Giants rookie Cam Skattebo leaves NFL fans in disbelief after failing to recognize NFL legends in viral quiz“The true definition of a son” -NBA legend Allen Iverson shares heartfelt post on his son days after making sweet gesture towards ex-wife“Harshest critics”: Wayne Gretzky's daughter Paulina Gretzky on overcoming criticism and learning to love herself unapologeticallyUkraine's drone attack on Russia used open-source software, 'upset' developer says wanted to make flying robots: 'not in a million years...'Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis: If I were a student right now, I would study ...“It was really hard for me”- LeBron James’ wife Savannah reveals how being a teenage mother negatively impacted her sense of identityFBI reacts to Colorado attacker Mohamed Sabry Soliman not being charged with terror: 'We are not Federal Bureau of Word Games'Eid al-Adha prayer timings announced across UAE – find out the time in your cityUAE Golden Visa: Which universities make you eligible?

Doordarshan will telecast live the Mangala, Shringaar, Rajbhog, Sandhya, and Shayan Aartis offered to the Ram Lalla idol at the Ayodhya Ram temple on DD National, connecting devotees who can't visit the temple. National broadcaster Doordarshan has good news for Lord Ram Devotees. Doordarshan has announced that it will telecast live the morning prayers offered to the Ram Lalla idol at the Ram Temple in Ayodhya every day.Doordarshan has shared the same in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Doordarshan said that the morning aarti offered to Ram Lalla will be telecast live on DD National every morning from 6:30 am.The national broadcaster said that the decision to telecast the morning aarti live every day was taken with the aim of connecting devotees of Lord Ram, especially after the temple was inaugurated less than two months ago in a grand ceremony and everyone can't visit the temple in person. The Aarti will be telecast simultaneously on DD’s YouTube channel also.Secondly, the decision was taken because the Trust doesn’t have logistical arrangements as of now for a live broadcast. Therefore, DD will be posting a two-three-member crew on the temple premises for the coverage of the daily ritual.DD's announcement to telecast the Aarti live for 30 minutes every morning comes after getting the go-ahead from the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust for the same. Initially, DD will air the “Mangala aarti” for a few months, and then, the Ram Temple Trust will take a call on how to take it forward.6 Aartis daily at the Ayodhya Ram templeThere are 6 aartis of Ram Lalla held daily in Ayodhya Ram temple. These include Mangala Aarti at 4:30 am, Shringaar Aarti at 6:30 am, Rajbhog Aarti at 12 noon, Utthapan Aarti at 2 pm, Sandhya Aarti at 7 pm, and Shayan Aarti at 10 pm.Giving directions to devotees for Aarti, the temple trust said, "Entry for Mangala Aarti at 4 AM, Shringar Aarti at 6:15 AM, and Shayan Aarti at 10 PM is possible only with an entry pass. No entry passes required for other Aartis."Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust advisory to devoteesIn an advisory to devotees coming for darshan at the temple, the Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra said, "Devotees can enter the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir for Darshan from 6:30 AM to 9:30 PM.

The design aims to eliminate the hinge crease and reduce the device's thickness while offering added benefits and durability. However, its practicality remains uncertain. Microsoft discontinues Surface Duo smartphones but files a patent for a new foldable device with a single hinge system called 'spine cover plate'. The design aims to eliminate the hinge crease and reduce the device's thickness while offering added benefits and durability. However, its practicality remains uncertain. Microsoft did not get the success it was anticipating with its Android-powered Surface Duo-series smartphones. The company has discontinued the lineup after the Duo 2. But, this does not mean the company has stopped trying. A new patent application filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29, reveals that the company is working on another foldable or dual-display mobile device.The patent application describes the company’s take on the foldable smartphone concept with single hinge technology called “spine cover plate”.Next Microsoft smartphones could feature a Galaxy Z Fold-like designAccording to the patent application, the phone could feature a “flexible display” in a bookstyle design similar to Galaxy Z Fold decies. However, the entire focus is on the spine cover plate mechanism which is aimed at protecting the single-hinge system of the device by covering the structural element. The differentiating factor between the regular hinge and Microsoft’s design is that the spine cover adjusts automatically during the opening and closing of the phone to prevent any unnecessary gaps around the hinge to protect it from dust as well as water. Currently, Samsung’s design offers an IPX8 rating which makes their foldables water-resistant only.The patent further mentions that the new hinge mechanism could allow Microsoft to eliminate the hinge crease less visible than the current options available in the market. Moreover, Microsoft has also mentioned techniques that could allow them to reduce the overall thickness of the foldable smartphone by allowing the spine cover plate to move closer to the device’s hinge when folded. “By retracting the spine cover plate toward the central spine as the first display-supporting frame and the second display-supporting frame are rotated into a face-to-face orientation, the width of the folded computing device is reduced, thereby enabling easier and more comfortable handling of the device, such as with one hand,” Microsoft noted in the patent.Interesting idea, but practicality is a question markThe entire smartphone market is searching for a way to eliminate the foldable crease from their smartphones. Some brands have already implemented the water-drop folding mechanism to reduce it, but there’s nothing like a crease-free foldable out there. Apart from that, the durability quotient of foldable is also important considering all the movable parts these phones have. That said, adding another layer or a movable part on top of the entire foldable mechanism does not appear like a wise move despite the added benefits and durability Microsoft has explained in the patent application.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Initiatives include partnering with the Election Commission, prioritizing trusted content on YouTube, and implementing advertising policies for transparency. Measures against AI-generated content are also taken. Google has announced a series of initiatives aimed at supporting the democratic process and safeguarding its platforms from abuse during the upcoming Indian General Election. With millions of eligible voters heading to the polls, the tech giant has said that recognises its responsibility to connect users with reliable information and counter the spread of misinformation, including AI-generated content.Easy access to voting information on Search and YouTubeGoogle has mentioned that its primary focus is on providing easy access to authoritative information from trusted sources.The company has also partnered with the Election Commission of India to showcase critical details on Google Search and YouTube, such as how to register and vote, in English and Hindi. Apart from this, YouTube’s recommendation system will prioritise trusted content during the election season. Additionally, YouTube’s homepage will prominently showcase trusted content along with an “Up Next” panel to make election-related details easily available for users. YouTube will also highlight content from trusted sources during key moments through its Top News and Breaking News as well as a news watch page. Moreover, the tech giant has also set up information panels that indicate funding sources from publishers that receive public or government funding and information panels that provide topical context for topics prone to misinformation. Safeguarding misinformationTo protect the integrity of the electoral process and to protect its products and services from abuse, Google has re-inforced its existing policies to keep its products and platforms safe while curbing misinformation at the same time. Also, the policies apply to all users, irrespective of the content type. The company has employed a combination of human reviewers and artificial intelligence models to identify and remove content that violates these policies. Google's AI capabilities are enhancing its abuse-fighting efforts, enabling faster action against emerging threats.Advertising during election campaignsTo keep things transparent when it comes to election advertising, the company requires advertisers to undergo identity verification and provide necessary certifications from the Election Commission. Election ads must also include disclosures indicating the advertiser's identity and location. Google maintains a searchable hub for all election ads, providing insights into the advertisers and their spending.Restricting AI-generated contentGoogle has also taken some steps to help identify AI-generated content through new tools and policies. The company has introduced disclosure requirements for election ads containing synthetic content and will soon require creators on YouTube to label realistic altered or synthetic content. The new ad policies prohibit the use of manipulated media to mislead people, like deepfakes or doctored content.Google has also implemented restrictions to Gemini on the types of election-related queries it will respond to and has also prioritised the provision of high-quality information. Additional features, such as the "About this Image" tool in Search and digital watermarking for AI-generated images, aim to provide users with context and assess credibility.Furthermore, Google has joined the C2PA coalition, a cross-industry effort to provide transparency and context for AI-generated content. The company has confirmed the deployment of technology to counter harmful AI-generated content aimed at deceiving voters during the 2024 elections.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

TSMC's stock rallied, elevating its market capitalisation to a record, making it higher than Broadcom. Analysts expect TSMC to further advance amid surging AI-related revenue and strong pricing power.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has reclaimed a spot in the list of the world’s 10 most valuable companies, riding the optimism of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom in the tech industry that pushed its stock to record levels.According to a report by Bloomberg, TSMC’s stock rallied 14% last week, elevating the chipmaker’s market capitalisation to a record, before a 2% decline in early trading on Monday (March 11), pared it to $634 billion. However, the decline didn’t impact the company much as it still has a market share higher than that of Broadcom, the report noted.What analysts have to sayAnalysts from Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. expect the semiconductor giant – that has Apple, Nvidia and Qualcomm as its customers – to advance further amid surging AI-related revenue and strong pricing power. “Generative AI semi is an obvious growth driver for TSMC,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Charlie Chan wrote in a note last week. The company’s overseas expansion also helps mitigate geopolitical concerns, they said.TSMC’s revenue gained 9.4% in the first two months of 2024 as demand for high-end chips increased due to a wave of activity in AI.Nvidia gets ‘AI boost’This is not the first time this year that a chip company has seen its stock on an upward spiral. This year, Nvidia was among the companies that got a boost by a frenzy around generative AI.In the last month, Nvidia stock price has risen over 20% while in the last six months, it has risen over 90%. Moreover, in the last one year, Nvidia stock price has appreciated from $234.36 per share level to $875.28 per share mark – registering a 275% jump.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

The update combines gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer data, reducing magnetic interference and benefiting Google Maps and third-party apps on Android 5.0 or above. Google Maps is updating its Fused Orientation Provider (FOP) API to improve direction accuracy in busy areas. The update combines gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer data, reducing magnetic interference and benefiting Google Maps and third-party apps on Android 5.0 or above. We keep hearing about Google Maps fiasco from across the globe where it directed people in some odd direction and eventually got them stuck in a ‘worst case scenario’. Now a new post published on the Android Developers blog gives an insight about Maps getting a new update to better with directions. The post talks about a potential upgrade that Maps will be getting with the Fused Orientation Provider (FOP) API that aims to make the ‘orientation’ detection better on Android devices, irrespective of the hardware used by different OEMs on their devices. According to the post, the update will make Maps interpret the directions better to make it more accurate by combining the gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer data. However, this idea of Google using data from all the sensors isn’t new, the company has used the API before, but the update will make better magnetic interference. As per the post, the changes will not only apply to Google Maps but also third-party apps that rely on Google Maps to offer navigational data. It is to be noted that the update will be done with internals of the Google Maps, it won’t affect the user interface or the layout of the app. Also, the updated API will be rolled out from the server side or via the app update in Android devices running Android 5.0 or above. How it will affect usersAs mentioned, the update won’t change anything in terms of the app’s design or user interface. The changes are internal in the form of API which will be pushed automatically via the update. That said, the update is set to make it better with directions, especially in busy areas.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Musk announces xAI open sourcing Grok chatbot. OpenAI CEO Altman takes a dig at Musk's chatbot. Musk, obviously didn't like the jab and replied with a long-ish message saying “GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.”  Elon Musk has been extremely critical of ChatGPT maker OpenAI for deviating from its mission to develop AI for the benefit of humanity and taking a profit-making path. He has advocated that artificial intelligence (AI) should be accessible for all, and he has now announced that his AI startup xAI will open source Grok chatbot this week.“This week, @xAI will open source Grok,” Musk said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).In simpler words, open-sourcing a software, like a chatbot, means that the software projects are redistributable as all source code is accessible by everyone. One of the advantages of having open source software is that it provides flexibility to an enterprise to have multiple ways of fixing a problem rather than waiting for an internal team to provide a solution.“OpenAI is a lie”Meanwhile, a user suggested that OpenAI should do the same.“OpenAI should do the same if they are ‘open’ that is,” the user said. Musk replied, “OpenAI is a lie.”Musk wants AI technology to be open-source Musk had floated the idea of open-sourcing AI during a podcast in November last year. In a podcast with Lex Fridman, Musk suggested that he likes the idea of open-source AI. “I am generally in favour of open sourcing, like biassed towards open sourcing,” he said.His comments came soon after his AI company called xAI released Grok, its chatbot, which reportedly took four months to build. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was quick to take a dig at this and shared a post in which he built Grok with a single prompt on GPT Builder."GPTs can save a lot of effort:” he said.Musk, obviously didn't like the jab and replied with a long-ish message saying “GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.” About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Ruby Johnson filed a lawsuit against Detective Gary Staab and Sgt. Gregory Buschy.  Apple's Find My app has cost the city of Denver, US $3.76 million in compensation and damages. In 2022, the city’s police wrongly raided and ransacked an elderly woman's home looking for a stolen truck and guns. According to a report by CNN, Denver police were seeking to recover a stolen truck loaded with guns, ammo and cash. For this, the police used Apple's Find My technology on another iPhone to locate the vehicle.However, the police picked the wrong house out of a fairly wide area to storm in and catch the thieves. Due to this misplaced raid, 78-year-old Ruby Johnson filed a lawsuit against the police. As compensation, the city will be paying Johnson a $3.76 million award. Moreover, the defendant officers — Detective Gary Staab and Sgt. Gregory Buschy — were also sued as an individual. Denver police had previously cleared both men of wrongdoing, but the jury disagreed.How Apple’s Find My app played a roleThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) brought the case on behalf of Johnson. The lawsuit mentioned that the raid was conducted based on an “alleged location ping from an iPhone's Find My app that the officers did not understand and for which they had no training." As per the complaint, the police relied on a "Find My" ping from an iPhone 11 that was probably still in the stolen truck. However, the area identified included parts of six other properties across parts of four city blocks.In a statement, Johnson's attorney Tim Macdonald said: “We are disturbed by the lack of training or policy changes and hope that the amount of the punitive damages award will send a strong message that the police department must take seriously the constitutional rights of its residents.” The ACLU and the jury concluded that the two police officers who ordered the raid had no reason to single out Johnson's house as the target. Also, the officers have to pay nearly $1.25 million each in punitive and compensatory damages. A Denver District Court clerk noted that the city has not yet filed an appeal of the verdict.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

A bill to sell TikTok is introduced, backed by President Biden. Kotick discussed acquisition with OpenAI head. Activision Blizzard faced a lawsuit. Concerns about data privacy and ties to China persist. TikTok urges American users to support it.  Bobby Kotick, the former head of Activision Blizzard, is reportedly considering buying TikTok, as the app could be banned in the United States. The Wall Street Journal reports that Kotick has talked to ByteDance, the company that owns TikTok, about buying the app, which could cost hundreds of billions of dollars.This comes as US lawmakers introduce a new bill that would make ByteDance sell TikTok within six months or stop it from being available in US app stores.President Joe Biden has said he would approve the bill if it passes in Congress.The Wall Street Journal report adds that Kotick, the head of OpenAI, Sam Altman, discussed teaming up to buy TikTok at a dinner last week. Kotick's interest in TikTok follows a rough end to his 30 years leading Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft acquired last year. The company faced a lawsuit saying it allowed sexual harassment and discrimination under Kotick's leadership. The Wall Street Journal also said Kotick knew about bad behaviour and didn't tell the board everything. Kotick was accused of harassment, but Activision Blizzard said the report was "misleading."Lawmakers are worried about data privacy and TikTok's ties to China. US President Biden, whose administration has banned the app already on state devices, has expressed his support for banning the app in the US. However, former President Donald Trump, who once wanted to ban TikTok, has changed his mind, saying a ban would help TikTok's rivals, like Facebook and YouTube. As the bill against TikTok gains support, the app has asked its American users to speak up for it, sending messages telling users to call their representatives. The bill, which passed a committee last week, is expected to be approved when the House votes on Wednesday. If it passes, it will then go to the Senate, and then the bill will be signed by the President of the US.Former Activision boss reportedly wants to buy TikTokAbout the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Reason is said to be delay in the delivery of two supercomputers by the French company to Indian weather forecasting institutes. According to a report in news agency PTI, the Earth Sciences Ministry had ordered two supercomputers worth $100 million from French firm Eviden, of the Atos Group, last year to enhance the computing capabilities of its institutions -- the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM)."I am more upset because the target we set was December. The Union Cabinet had already approved purchasing the supercomputer. We have only four petaflop capacity. We want to install up to 18 petaflop capacity," Rijiju told PTI in a video interview.He said that the French company ran into some financial trouble and wanted the government to make payment to its subsidiary.Minister says that the delay is causing him "worry"Rijiju said that the delay has caused him lots of worry as the company has overshot the timeline. "But I think we will sort it out soon," he said, adding that the government wanted to be "very correct in our position legally"."We are ready to release the money because we want the machine immediately. The only problem is the amount is not small. So if we pay now, if the company is bankrupt or something happens, who will bail out," the minister said.Rijiju further added that the government was taking some steps to speed up the delivery of the supercomputer but did not elaborate. "But I hope the French government will also intervene because we have a good understanding and a very good relationship with the French government."Since it is a high-cost equipment, we want to ensure that the transaction happens duly and properly," he said."From outside, everything's ready. It is only the problem with the main company. They want us to pay their subsidiary. We will pay only to a company whom we have entered an MoU with," Rijiju said.The supercomputing system, based on Eviden's BullSequana XH2000, is said to have a combined power capacity of up to 21.3 petaflops.Supercomputer at IITMThe supercomputer at the Pune-based IITM will provide 13 petaflops of computing power for atmosphere and climate research. As per the PTI report, it will integrate 3,000 CPU nodes using AMD EPYC 7643 processors and 26 GPU nodes through NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. The system will benefit from the NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand networking platform with In-Network Computing, 3PB all flash and 29PB disk-based DDN EXAScaler ES400NVX2 storage and Micron high-technology memory.The existing computing facility at NCMRWF is 2.8 petaflops and at IITM is 4 petaflops, respectively.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

The inspections were conducted to evaluate adherence to the Board's operational norms and ensure compliance with CBSE Bye-Laws.Each inspection team comprised one officer from the CBSE and a principal from a CBSE-affiliated school. All inspections were synchronised and executed simultaneously across the selected locations in a short time window, maintaining the surprise element of the exercise.Inspections held across six regionsThe selected schools were located in Assam, Delhi, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Odisha.

Texas signs $8.5 billion education bill to fix teacher shortages and certification crisis in schools
Texas is tackling its teacher crisis with House Bill 2, an $8.5 billion investment in education. The bill overhauls teacher training and certification, aiming to raise salaries and mandate full certification for core subject teachers by 2027-28. It also limits the hiring of uncertified teachers and supports residency programs to improve teacher preparation and retention, especially in rural districts.

The bill overhauls teacher training and certification, aiming to raise salaries and mandate full certification for core subject teachers by 2027-28. It also limits the hiring of uncertified teachers and supports residency programs to improve teacher preparation and retention, especially in rural districts.  Texas has faced a growing teacher crisis over the past decade. Loosened certification requirements and alternative pathways led to more than half of new public school teachers being uncertified, with nearly 1 in 5 lacking a college degree. Research reported by The 74 shows these trends have contributed to weaker student outcomes and high teacher turnover. Students with new, uncertified teachers lose around four months of reading and three months of math learning each year, compounding pandemic-related learning losses.In June, Governor Greg Abbott signed House Bill 2, a historic $8.5 billion education package aimed at overhauling teacher training, certification, and retention across the state.Key measures in House Bill 2Teacher Preparation Funding: Nearly $190 million allocated for teacher preparation and certification programs.Teacher Pay Raises: Around $4 billion dedicated to raising salaries for teachers and staff, with extra incentives for core subject teachers, long-serving educators, and staff in smaller districts.Certification Mandate: Core subject teachers must be fully certified by the 2027-28 school year, with an optional extension to 2029-30. Current teachers pursuing certification can earn a $1,000 bonus.Residency and Training Programs: Districts receive up to $39,500 per teacher resident and $21,500 per student teacher. Funding also supports high-quality program content, including mandatory reading and math academies.Addressing the teacher pipelineHouse Bill 2 limits parts of the 2015 Districts of Innovation policy, which previously allowed most Texas districts to hire uncertified teachers. By the 2023-24 school year, 56% of all new Texas teachers were uncertified, and almost three-quarters had no prior experience in Texas public schools, according to The 74. This lack of preparation contributed to high turnover, with 64% of uncertified teachers leaving the classroom within five years compared to about a third of traditionally certified teachers.Preparing teachers for the classroomResidency programs, such as the one at The University of Texas El Paso, provide year-long, immersive training that pairs teacher candidates with mentor teachers in challenging classrooms. Residents gradually take on teaching responsibilities, gaining hands-on experience before their first full year in the classroom. Prior to House Bill 2, financial support for residents was limited, making it difficult to maintain the program. The new legislation ensures stipends for residents, making high-quality training more accessible, especially for students from low-income backgrounds.Wider impactsBeyond teacher training, House Bill 2 expands career and technical education, reforms special education, and increases funding for charter schools. Merit-based and retention-based pay programs aim to keep experienced teachers in the classroom, particularly in rural districts, where uncertified teacher hiring had been four times higher than the state average, according to The 74.With these sweeping measures, Texas is taking a historic step toward addressing teacher shortages, improving student outcomes, and creating a sustainable teacher pipeline for the future.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

Union Minister Manohar Lal inaugurated the event, administered a de-addiction oath, and emphasised youth involvement in national progress. The event highlighted patriotism, drug de-addiction, and environmental protection, with thousands participating. The yatra concluded at Jat College with cultural programmes, reinforcing youth commitment to nation-building and social harmony. Celebration of Tricolor in MDU: Rohtak immersed in the wave of patriotism, Union minister Manohar Lal administered the oath of de-addiction! ROHTAK: The campus of Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU) was painted in the colors of patriotism today, where the grand Tiranga Yatra gathered a huge crowd. This event was not only a part of the Amrit Mahotsav of Independence, but also became a strong medium to awaken the spirit of patriotism, de-addiction and environmental protection among the youth. Thousands of students, teachers, citizens and dignitaries took to the streets holding the tricolor in their hands, and the entire atmosphere resonated with the slogans of 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' and 'Vande Mataram'.Union Minister Manohar Lal inaugurated the yatra from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Cricket Stadium of MDU. On this occasion, MDU Vice Chancellor Prof. Rajbir Singh, Chairperson, Rehabilitation Council of India Dr. Sharanjit Kaur, Registrar Dr. Krishan Kant, eminent doctor Dr. Aditya Batra, industrialist Rajesh Jain and many other special guests were present. Union Minister Manohar Lal said in his motivational address that the tricolor is not just a flag, but a symbol of the country's honor and pride. During the freedom struggle, lakhs of revolutionaries sacrificed their lives for its honor. He appealed to the youth to play an active role in national interest, protect the dignity of the tricolor and connect with social concerns. The minister stressed that the young generation should awaken the spirit of patriotism, so that India can become a strong and developed nation.Appreciating MDU's 'Nasha Mukt Ghar' campaign, the minister called it an important link in the nationwide drug de-addiction movement. He administered the oath of de-addiction to all the people present and said that drug addiction is hollowing out the roots of society. Apart from this, the minister gave the message of environmental protection by planting saplings in the stadium premises, which proved to be a meaningful step against climate change. By joining this campaign, the youth will not only keep themselves healthy, but will also contribute in making the society drug-free.VC Prof. Rajbir Singh, who was presiding over the program, expressed his commitment to turn the drug-free campaign into a mega campaign. He said that today there is a dire need for freedom from drugs. More than 2.50 lakh students, teachers and staff members of MDU and its affiliated 250 colleges will unite in this campaign and work towards making Haryana drug-free. The Vice Chancellor pledged to remain dedicated to this goal throughout his life, which became a big source of inspiration for the youth.Dr. Sharanjit Kaur called upon the youth to preserve the cultural heritage of the country, increase social harmony and adopt the spirit of service. He said that such events bring positive change in the society. The Tiranga Yatra passed through the university campus and reached the Shaheed Smarak at Gate No. 1, where Minister Manohar Lal paid floral tribute to the immortal martyrs. After this, the yatra reached the Jat College playground, where it concluded with patriotic songs, slogans and cultural programs. The enthusiasm of the youth was worth seeing, who not only consider the tricolor as the pride of the past but also the responsibility of the future.Thousands of people including MDU students, NSS and YRC volunteers, NCC cadets, players, campus school students, members of social organizations, BJP District President Ranbir Dhaka, President, Jat Education Society Rohtak Gulab Singh Dimana participated in this event. This Tiranga Yatra will become a source of inspiration for the coming generations and will strengthen the participation of youth in nation building. Such programs play an important role in keeping the country united and fighting social evils.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now. Follow us here.Ready to navigate global policies?

US court allows DOGE access to Education Department data: Here's how it impacts students
A U.S. appeals court has restored the Department of Government Efficiency’s (DOGE) access to Education Department databases, overturning a prior block amid privacy concerns. The ruling, tied to a broader lawsuit, impacts access to student loan data for millions. While K-12 records weren’t accessed, the decision raises ongoing debates over data privacy, government efficiency, and oversight.

The ruling, tied to a broader lawsuit, impacts access to student loan data for millions. While K-12 records weren’t accessed, the decision raises ongoing debates over data privacy, government efficiency, and oversight.  A recent ruling by a federal appeals court has significant implications for students across the United States. On August 12, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond, Virginia, overturned a preliminary injunction that had previously blocked the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, from accessing sensitive records at the U.S. Department of Education, as well as the Treasury Department and the Office of Personnel Management. The decision restores DOGE’s access to federal databases while the broader legal challenge continues.What is DOGE and why does it matter for students? DOGE was established under the Trump administration to improve efficiency across federal agencies. The office, closely associated with Elon Musk, who served as an informal adviser to former President Trump, has employees embedded in multiple agencies to review operations and data. Although Musk stepped down from his White House role in May 2025, DOGE continues its work.According to the EdWeek, the American Federation of Teachers, along with other unions and individuals, had challenged DOGE’s access, arguing that it violated the Privacy Act of 1974 and placed sensitive data at risk. Specifically, the lawsuit noted DOGE employees accessed the Student Loan Data System, which contains records of approximately 43 million Americans, including teachers. The suit did not allege that K-12 student records were accessed.The court’s reasoning In its 2-1 decision, the 4th Circuit cited procedural issues with the lawsuit and indicated that the plaintiffs would likely have difficulty proving a violation of the Privacy Act. According to the EdWeek, Judge Julius N. Richardson, a Trump appointee, wrote that DOGE employees are tasked with a broad duty to improve agency efficiency and would find it challenging to know what needs reform without reviewing the data. Judge Richardson further noted that “each plaintiff’s information is one row in various databases that are millions upon millions of rows long,” suggesting that the potential harm from granting access to a handful of government employees differs in kind from the risks posed by reporters, investigators, or paparazzi. The majority also referenced a U.S. Supreme Court order in June that allowed DOGE employees access to Social Security Administration files, which similarly faced privacy concerns. According to the EdWeek, Richardson stated, “This case and that one are exceedingly similar”.In dissent, Judge Robert B. King, a Clinton appointee, argued that the district court had provided a thorough analysis demonstrating the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their Privacy Act claim. He described DOGE’s access as “sudden, unfettered, unprecedented, and apparently unnecessary” and emphasised the sensitivity of the personal information involved. Implications for students For students, this ruling highlights the ongoing tension between government efficiency initiatives and the safeguarding of personal data. While K-12 records were not part of the lawsuit, the ruling still involves access to large federal education databases, which could include higher education loan records and other student-related information. It underscores the need for students and educators to remain aware of how personal data is accessed and managed at the federal level. The case is not yet fully resolved. The full 4th Circuit is expected to examine the broader implications of DOGE’s access in the Social Security Administration case in September, which may provide further clarity on the limits and oversight of such government data initiatives. As legal proceedings continue, students and education stakeholders may see changes in how government offices access and use sensitive educational and personal data, making this a topic worth monitoring closely.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

The protests intensified, with students marching and burning an effigy of the Vice Chancellor. The university cites infrastructure improvements as the reason.  Students at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) have been protesting for five days against a sharp increase in annual fees, which they say will block access to higher education for many, especially those from economically weaker backgrounds. On Tuesday, the protest intensified with students marching to the district collectorate and burning an effigy of Vice Chancellor Naima Khatoon.Fee hike up to 42% sparks outrageThe recent fee hike ranges between 36 to 42 percent for some courses. For instance, the annual fee for the Bachelor of Library Science (B.Lib) course jumped from Rs 16,000 last year to over Rs 22,000 this year. The All India Jammu and Kashmir Students Association (AIJKSA) described the increase as “arbitrary, unjustified and exclusionary,” reported PTI.J&K students association appeals to Union Education MinisterNasir Khehami, AIJKSA’s national convenor, said, “The students have been courageously opposing what they see as an arbitrary, unjustified and exclusionary fee hike of up to 36-42 per cent imposed by the university administration,” as reported by PTI. He added, “For this session, the fee for some courses has increased by around 30-40 per cent. For example, the B.Lib course fee was Rs 16,000 last year and has been raised to over Rs 22,000.”University cites infrastructure improvements as reason for hikeAMU Proctor Wasim Ali confirmed the fee increase ranged from Rs 500 to Rs 1,500 across courses, explaining that the hike was mainly to improve infrastructure and was a collective decision by various committees, reported PTI. However, Khehami emphasised, “this explanation does not lessen the crushing burden on the students, many of whom come from socially backward classes, working-class families and economically weaker sections, and are already struggling to meet their daily expenses, including basic meals,” as reported by PTI.Besides the fee issue, students have been demanding the conduct of students’ union elections, which have not been held for eight years. They also seek the removal of certain senior university officials whom they accuse of mishandling the current crisis, reported PTI.Concerns over police crackdown on campusThe protests saw a police crackdown on Friday during collective prayers at the dharna site. Opposition MPs have expressed concern over the reported use of force, writing to the Vice Chancellor demanding explanations and accountability, according to PTI.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a national coalition of farmer bodies, has extended its support to the AMU students. The SKM plans to highlight student grievances alongside farmer issues at a ‘Virodh Diwas’ protest in Aligarh. The group has also called for an investigation into the police actions on campus, reported PTI.The ongoing protests at AMU highlight the challenges faced by students from underprivileged backgrounds in accessing affordable higher education. As fees rise sharply, many fear losing the opportunity to study at prestigious institutions like AMU.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

Boney Kapoor celebrates wife Sridevi's 62nd birth anniversaryOn August 13, 2025, Boney Kapoor commemorated his late wife Sridevi’s 62nd birth anniversary with a heartfelt tribute on social media. He fondly recalled how her "few words in broken Hindi and English" deeply moved him and sparked his curiosity to know her better.

In response, the couple visited temples and performed penance rituals to seek forgiveness.

In response, she shared bold Instagram photos with the caption "Stop staring!"

Netizens criticized Mrunal's comments, deeming them hypocritical given her stance on body positivity. Bipasha responded with a cryptic message emphasizing the importance of strong women supporting each other and embracing physical strength.  While Mrunal Thakur has been in the news for her dating rumours with Dhanush, the 'Super 30' actress has also been spoken about due to her viral video. This throwback video is from her television days when she was doing 'Kumkum Bhagya'. In this interview with her co-star Arjit Taneja where they talk about fitness. In this interview, as Arijit talks about the kind of women he likes, Mrunal tells him, "What you like manly women or what with muscles." She further tells him, "Go marry Bipasha," further adding that, "I'm much better than Bipasha." As this video went viral, netizens didn't take it well and slammed Mrunal. Bipasha has now broken silence on this viral video. While her note is cryptic, it is very obvious that this is Bipasha's reaction. The 'Dhoom 2' actress took to her Instagram stories and wrote,“Strong women lift each other up. Get those muscles beautiful ladies… we should be strong… muscles help you attain good physical and mental health forever! Bust the age old thought process that women should not look strong or be physically strong!"The internet criticised Mrunal for this video. People called Bipasha Basu an icon and added that she also has a song named after her. A user said, "When she said manly with muscles I imagined a steroided up body builder, How is bipasha manly at all?" Another one added, "2 minutes of silence for her confidence 😂😂😂" A person commented, "' i will change beauty standards ' said by a woman who herself is bodyshaming a woman..🤢🤯" As Mrunal got unanimously slammed online for talking about body positivity and then shading another woman. Meanwhile, amidst the backlash faced by Mrunal, she dropped some photos on Instagram with the caption, "Stop staring". On work front, Mrunal was last seen in 'Son Of Sardaar 2' which released recently, along with Akshay Kumar.

Bollywood icon Dev Anand's life was marked by a discreet yet profound romance with Kalpana Karthik. Their secret wedding, a stark contrast to the industry's fanfare, occurred during a lunch break on the set of 'Taxi Driver'. Kalpana, born Mona Singha, left her promising film career after marriage to embrace family life, cherishing their private bond away from public scrutiny.  In Bollywood, where love stories often unfold under the harsh glare of the spotlight, some romances are quietly nurtured in the shadows. One such tale belongs to Dev Anand and Kalpana Karthik — a union that defied religious boundaries, bloomed away from prying eyes, and remained one of the industry’s most charmingly guarded secrets. Gurdaspur to the city of dreamsDev Anand, Bollywood’s original style icon, was celebrated for his suave charm, distinctive dialogue delivery, and a trademark hairstyle that fans tried to emulate. His signature look — a black coat paired with a crisp white shirt — became so famous (and distracting) that it was once reportedly banned in courtrooms.Hailing from Gurdaspur Dev Anand earned his English degree from Lahore in 1942. Though he dreamt of pursuing higher studies, financial hardships stood in the way. In 1945, with just ₹20 in his pocket, he set out for Mumbai to chase his cinematic dreams.PollWhich of Dev Anand's films do you think is the most iconic? GuideTaxi DriverA humble startWithout a place to call his own, he shared a cramped room near the railway station with three other dreamers chasing fame. As his savings ran out, he found work at the Military Censor Office, sifting through soldiers’ letters for a monthly pay of Rs 165.About a year later, he sought help from his elder brother, Chetan Anand, already an established name in cinema. Chetan offered him small roles, leading to the superstar's debut in 1946 with Hum Ek Hain. While the film failed at the box office, his next release, Ziddi (1948), catapulted him to overnight stardom. Over his illustrious career, he starred in 112 films, delivering timeless classics like Taxi Driver (1954), CID (1956), Paying Guest (1957), Nau Do Gyarah (1957), Kala Paani (1958), Asli-Naqli (1962), Guide (1965), Jewel Thief (1967), Johny Mera Naam (1970), Tere-Mere Sapne (1971), Hare Rama Hare Krishna (1971), and Heera Panna (1973).The Suraiya chapterIn those days, life moved at a gentler rhythm, and emotions carried deep weight. The actor was deeply in love with actress Suraiya, but their romance faced staunch opposition from her family over religious differences. Suraiya chose never to marry, holding on to her enduring affection for him.While shooting Taxi Driver, he developed a fondness for his co-star Mona Singh, who later adopted the screen name Kalpana Karthik. What began as friendship soon blossomed into a quiet, enduring romance.A secret weddingDuring one lunch break on the set, the duo slipped away unnoticed. When they returned, a keen-eyed cameraman spotted a fresh ring on Dev Anand’s finger. With a knowing smile, Dev quietly requested him to keep the secret.It was later revealed that the two had secretly tied the knot. Dev Anand believed marriage was an intimate affair, not something to be turned into a public spectacle.Who was Kalpana Karthik?Kalpana Karthik, born Mona Singha into a Christian-Punjabi family, adopted her screen name when Chetan Anand cast her in Baazi (1951). Before her film debut, she had participated in the Miss Shimla contest, where she first caught Chetan Anand’s attention—they were cousins by marriage.Kalpana's brief yet memorable film career featured roles in Andhiyan (1952), Humsafar (1953), Taxi Driver (1954), House No. 44 (1955), and Nau Do Gyarah (1957). Following her marriage to Dev Anand, she stepped away from the spotlight to focus on family life. The couple had two children, Sunil Anand and Debina.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

She emphasized that the cancer treatment was more challenging than the illness itself, citing the severe side effects of the medications and expressing reliance on faith during the difficult period.  Actor and politician Kirron Kher was diagnosed with Cancer in 2020 and now that she has recovered from it, she had opened up on her journey in an interview. Kirron had spoken about how her family, husband Anupam Kher and son Sikander Kher had reacted to her illness. She also opened up on her diagnosis and how the actual treatment of Cancer is more dangerous and has more side-effects. Recalling how husband Anupam Kher was completely shaken as he got to know she has Cancer, Kirron said on News18’s She Shakti event where she appeared along with Sikandar. The actor said, "It was end of 2020, I was shooting for my movie Monkey Man in Indonesia at that time. I was there for 4 months, everything is in a bubble so you are disconnected from the rest of the world. Life plays it’s cards the way it does. What do you do at that point? I think she is very strong that way, we were always there and are there for her throughout. At the end of the day, life goes on and work goes on. There’s nothing much that you can do, right?" Kirron Kher’s Rare Appearance Stuns Fans | Supports Anupam Kher at 'Tanvi The Great' PremiereKirron further added to what Sikandar said and revealed that he's never been emotional about it ever. She said, "I have never seen you being emotional about it ever. I wanted you to be a little bit but you were not." Responding to it, Sikandar joked, "Main toh bimaari ke liye darr raha tha, maa. How can it mess with you? It can’t mess with you. Galat jagah aagaye boss tum. Those conversations were between me and dad when I was in Bataam." He went on to explain his approach, saying, “The thing is, you have to be strong. You can’t be saying ‘Oh My God’ around the person, it is going to kill all the good energy around you. Nobody is feeling good about it. Unfortunately, the situation and what happened is one of the worst things that happen in the world.”Kirron acknowledged his steady demeanor, contrasting it with Anupam’s nervousness. “Anupam used to look thoda sa ghabraaya hua when he used to come into my hospital room, but Sikander was cool. Every human is scared at one point in life about anything happening to them. But when it happens, the only option you have is to accept it,” she said.Sharing more about her battle, Kirron revealed that the treatment was even more grueling than the illness itself. “You have to get the treatment done. Bimaari se zyada khatarnaak ilaaj hai iska. The medicines and their side effects. The first 6-8 months were very tough, then God was kind. You leave it to the Lord. The Lord fights for me, who are we? We are nobodies,” she expressed.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

How Alka's career became unlucky for her marriage
Alka Yagnik, a prominent singer, married businessman Neeraj Kapoor in 1989. Their relationship faced challenges due to Alka's thriving career in Mumbai and Neeraj's residence in Shillong. Despite initial family objections, they married. Alka acknowledges the strain of living apart. She recognizes Neeraj's support as crucial to her success. They continue to remain married.

Their relationship faced challenges due to Alka's thriving career in Mumbai and Neeraj's residence in Shillong. Despite initial family objections, they married. Alka acknowledges the strain of living apart. She recognizes Neeraj's support as crucial to her success. They continue to remain married.   Alka Yagnik entered the industry at a time when Lata Mangeshkar was still ruling and of course, till date, nobody has been able to reach that level. However, in the 90s, Alka carved her own niche and wooed the audience with her soulful voice. It's now been four decades since she's been a playback singer and has more than 20,000 songs to her credit. Her romantic duet songs with Udit Narayan and Kumar Sanu and some solos continue to woo the audience over the years. She created an unparalleled place for herself. But do you know that this successful career hugely came in the way of her marriage. In 1989, Alka tied the knot with businessman Neeraj Kapoor, whom she had known through family ties. “My husband Neeraj Kapoor is a businessman. He has a house in Shillong, the capital of Meghalaya. We already had family connections. Neeraj’s aunt was my mother’s classmate. I call her mausi. Neeraj is mausi’s nephew. We first met at his house. We both fell in love,” she shared in a Doordarshan interview.The biggest hurdle was that they lived in different cities. While Neeraj lived in Shillong, Alka’s music career was firmly rooted in Mumbai. Her parents initially objected, fearing the distance would strain the relationship. But the couple stood their ground. “We insisted on getting married. Seeing the insistence of both of us, the family members gave in and we got married,” she recalled.PollWhich Alka Yagnik song do you enjoy the most? Taal Se Taal Mila Dil Hai Ki Manta NahinTheir initial plan was to divide their time between Shillong and Mumbai. But fate had other ideas. “Then my career suddenly progressed so fast that it became impossible for me to go away from Mumbai for even a day,” she admitted. The separation took its toll. “My husband always says that I am lucky for your career but unlucky for mine. It was my mistake. I had promised him,” Alka said candidly.Their whirlwind romance moved quickly — they married just two months after falling in love. “We used to talk on the phone at night. When the huge bill came, my mother caught hold of it. However, it was too late by then. I had decided that I had to marry Neeraj only.”Decades later, the two remain married but have spent most of their lives apart. “We have lived in different cities all our lives. Sometimes there is such a gap between us that it takes two-four days to know and understand each other. Many times I feel that I could have spent more time with my husband,” she reflected, adding that Neeraj’s unwavering support has been a cornerstone of her success.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

His family struggled with poverty after becoming political refugees. Chan's father even considered selling him for $250. Friends intervened, preventing the sale. Chan started as a child actor and stuntman. His breakthrough came with 'The Snake in the Eagle's Shadow'. He then revolutionized action cinema.  Action legend Jackie Chan may be one of the most recognisable movie stars in the world today, but his journey to fortune and global fame began in extreme hardship. The 'Rush Hour' actor, whose net worth is now estimated at over $557 million, was once going to be sold by his parents to help them overcome poverty.The actor once made the shocking revelation that his dad considered selling him to a British doctor for just $250, as "we was so poor."In a rather candid chat on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, the superstar recalled his parents’ struggles dealing with poverty and as political refugees from the Chinese Civil War. Revealing the reason for his father's decision to 'sell him', he shared, “my parents could not afford to pay the money, my father wanted to sell me to the British doctor for 250 dollars.”However, it was all because of a friend that his fate was changed. He shared, “As soon as my father wanted to sell me, somehow my friends [said], ‘No, no, no, this is your only child, you keep it.’ My father was lucky to keep me.”Chan's struggles continued well into his childhood. At age 5, he began working as a child actor in the Hong Kong film industry and earning a minimal income with small roles. He later became a stuntman at 17 before eventually transitioning into full-fledged action roles. He eventually got his big break in 1978 with The Snake in the Eagle's Shadow, after which, he went on to redefine action cinema with his unique blend of martial arts, comedy, and death-defying stunts.

Anand Mahindra revealed that Om Shanti Om's iconic fire sequence, starring Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone, was filmed at Mumbai’s Mukesh Mills, a location with a fiery past. Action director Sham Kaushal shared that the scene used real flames, making the shoot extremely stressful and dangerous for the cast and crew. The film marked Deepika Padukone’s debut. Almost 17 years after Om Shanti Om lit up the big screen, a fascinating behind-the-scenes detail about its iconic fire sequence has come to light. Anand Mahindra recently revealed that the dramatic scene — where Shah Rukh Khan’s Om risks his life to save Deepika Padukone’s Shantipriya — was filmed at Mumbai’s Mukesh Mills, a location with its own fiery past and eerie reputation.Connection between film and locationAt the event, Mahindra revealed that the location held a special connection to Om Shanti Om. He noted that Shah Rukh Khan chose to film the fire sequence at Mukesh Mills, possibly inspired by its own history — the site had once been destroyed in a fire, mirroring the film’s storyline of flames and reincarnation.SRK Praises Deepika's Motherhood RoleHe also pointed out that Shah Rukh had ridden a luxury bike in his 1994 hit Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa, adding that the actor has a fondness for the brand — making the motorcycle’s launch at Mukesh Mills all the more fitting.PollHow do you feel about using real fire instead of VFX in film scenes?It's thrilling and adds realismIt's too dangerous and riskyNo VFX, only real flamesIn an earlier interview with Hindi Rush, action director Sham Kaushal revealed that no VFX was used for the scene at the time — the fire was real. The set housed SRK, Deepika, three cameramen, and about 60 crew members from his team, making it nearly 100 people inside a burning set.An extremely stressful shootHe further shared that the shoot was extremely stressful, as the fire had to be extinguished within seconds of being lit to avoid any mishap. A single mistake could have led to disaster. Kaushal admitted there were moments when he stepped aside to cry on set, feeling so overwhelmed that he feared he might suffer a heart attack.Om Shanti Om, directed by Farah Khan, released in 2007 and marked Deepika Padukone’s acting debut. Alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika, the film also starred Shreyas Talpade, Arjun Rampal, and Kirron Kher in key roles.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Davinder Rajput claims Armaan married four times, violating Hindu law, and Payal insulted religious beliefs by dressing as a Hindu goddess.  YouTuber and Bigg Boss OTT 3 contestant Armaan Malik, along with his two wives, Payal and Kritika Malik, is facing legal heat after a Patiala district court issued summons in two separate cases. The legal action stems from a petition filed by Davinder Rajput, who has alleged that Armaan Malik is not just married twice — but four times — in violation of the Hindu Marriage Act, which allows only one marriage at a time for practising Hindus. As per a Live Hindustan report, the court has directed all three to appear on 2 September.The petition also accuses Armaan and Payal of hurting religious sentiments. It points to a video in which Payal dressed as Hindu goddess Kali, an act the complainant claims insulted religious beliefs and is punishable under Indian law.PollDo you believe reality TV shows should include contestants with unconventional family dynamics?Yes, diversity is importantNo, it complicates the narrativeAmid the backlash, Armaan and Payal Malik made public attempts at atonement. On 22 July, they visited Patiala’s Kali Mata Temple to offer prayers and apologise. The next day, on 23 July, they went to another Kali temple in Kharar, Mohali, where Payal reportedly undertook a seven-day religious penance, which involved cleaning the temple premises and performing rituals.Their reconciliation efforts didn’t stop there. The couple later travelled to Haridwar to seek forgiveness from Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Kailashanand Giri of the Niranjani Akhara. During this period, Payal’s health reportedly worsened, leading to her hospitalisation in Mohali.Armaan Malik, whose real name is Sandeep, hails from Hisar, Haryana. Before entering the social media limelight, he worked at a private bank in Delhi. His unconventional family life came into national focus when he entered Bigg Boss OTT 3 on 21 June 2024 with both wives, a move that has kept the trio firmly in the headlines ever since.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Furthermore, she added that what sets them apart is that the celebrities, including Katrina Kaif, listen to their bodies and respect the nutrition along with the exercise, following the charts she curated for them. The three leading actresses usually include pilates and high-functional training for their workout.About the 'zero-calorie noodles' Recently, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, a renowned chef introduced a recipe of zero-calorie noodles, which has been a favourite of Alia and Deepika.

The chef also recalled turning up a notch for the spice level for the ‘Piku’ actress as she demanded ‘ultra hot and extra spicy.’ With the proper exercising techniques, the actresses also take a hard look at the calories they intake and the food they consume.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

She attempted to recreate Madhuri Dixit's iconic 'Tamma Tamma' moves, but humorously admitted the result resembled Sanjay Dutt's style more. The post garnered funny reactions from her husband, Akshay Kumar, and other celebrities, with fans sharing their amusement and personal dance mishap stories.  Twinkle Khanna, fondly known as Mrs Funnybones, has once again showcased her signature wit and humour. Twinkle has never shied away from making fun of herself or her movies. She's often even admitted that she was not meant to be an actor but now being a writer comes so naturally to her. She has displayed her funny side again, this time with a dance video that has left the internet in splits. The actress-turned-author revealed she was trying to replicate a classic Madhuri Dixit move, but the end result, according to her, was something else entirely.In a recent Instagram post, the 51-year-old exuded her usual vibrant charm, dressed in a black full-sleeved top and loose-fitting denim pants. The actress can be seen dancing on the iconic 'Tamma Tamma' song which featured Madhuri Dixit and Sanjay Dutt. There's no denying that Madhuri is one of the best dancers in the industry. As she danced away happily to this popular number, she wrote in her caption, “Thought I was pulling off a Madhuri, but ended up looking like Sanjay Dutt." Her caption and moves made everyone laugh and how. She also added a cheeky footnote, during the pandemic, she had actually fractured her foot attempting the very same step. Wrapping up her post, she asked fans, “Whose dance style do you think you have and what’s the reality?”Her husband, Akshay Kumar, couldn’t resist chiming in, commenting, “Talent – questionable. Confidence – unshakable. Wife – priceless.” To which Twinkle playfully replied, "@akshaykumar hahahaha." Celebrities joined in on the fun too. Deepshikha Deshmukh wrote, “Wohooooo – the happy feeet,” Tahira Kashyap teased, “Killed it quite literally!” while Guneet Monga responded with laughing faces, hearts, and fire emojis.Fans flooded the comments with their own brand of humour. One remarked, “I love that confidence of counting to the beat 1 2 3 and then start. N most off all adore u for putting it on gram.” Another joked, “So proud of your ankles right now,” while someone else gushed, “Your brand of humour! A fan of it since your very first book and then all those writeups!” A delighted follower added, “This is peak Twinkle Khanna energy.”Some even shared personal anecdotes — one user wrote, “Twinkle dear I am 60 YO. I had also sprained my foot while attempting this step when this movie had come. Now I can’t stop laughing remembering about it,” and another quipped, “When someone says ‘Break a Leg’……. Delivered attempting a Madhuri step.”About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Rumors of an affair with Raj Kapoor surfaced, causing turmoil in his family life, even though she denied it. She later married Dr.  Vyjanthimala was one of the best actresses in Indian cinema, known for her movies like 'Naya Daur', 'Madhumati', 'Sangam' and more. While she achieved a top position among actresses of those times along with others like Waheeda Rehman, Madhubala, her journey wasn't easy. She faced a lot of body shaming and later was also in the news for rumours of her relationship with Raj Kapoor when he was already married to Krishna Kapoor. Her entry into films came at just 16, with the 1949 Tamil hit Vaazhkai. But her road to success wasn’t always smooth — she endured body shaming early in her career. In her memoir Bonding, she recalled how Nagin director Nandlal Jaswantlal would humiliate her in public: “You are too plump and still have a lot of baby fat. You have such a round face, that it fills the whole screen. Don’t look like an idli.” The taunts often left her with “tears shimmering in my eyes, all set to roll down.”Bollywood’s Golden Girls Reunite: Asha Parekh, Waheeda Rehman & Helen Share Heartfelt DinnerVyjayanthimala’s career choices were overseen by her grandmother, Yadugiri Devi, who mistrusted Raj Kapoor’s reputation with women. Even so, gossip linked the two actors, especially after Sangam. Vyjayanthimala denied any affair in her memoir, calling it a publicity stunt: “Manufacturing the romance because of his hunger for publicity.”But Rishi Kapoor’s autobiography Khullam Khulla told a different story. He wrote about moving out of the family home with his mother, Krishna Kapoor, during the alleged affair: “I remember moving into the Natraj Hotel on Marine Drive with my mom during the time papa was involved with Vyjayanthimala. From the hotel, we shifted for two months into an apartment in Chitrakoot. My father had bought the apartment for mom and us. He did all he could to woo her back, but my mother wouldn’t give in until he had ended that chapter of his life.”Vyjayanthimala and Raj Kapoor appeared together in just two films — Nazrana (1961) and Sangam (1964). Then, in 1968, at the height of her stardom, she stunned the industry by marrying the Kapoor family’s doctor, Dr. Chamanlal Bali, and stepping away from films. Dance, however, remained a constant in her life through stage performances. Reflecting on her decision, she wrote, “I made the wisest decision of my life, I left the films at the right time. I have no regrets because I worked with some of the best.”About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Picture Credit: X The Telugu action-drama 'Junior,' which marked the big-screen debut of Kireeti Reddy, son of mining baron Gali Janardhana Reddy, seems to be getting a digital release. Directed by Radha Krishna Reddy, the film pairs the newcomer with young star Sreeleela in the female lead role. It also marks the return of Genelia Deshmukh to Telugu cinema after several years.OTT detailsAccording to a report by 123Telugu, 'Junior' is likely to make its OTT debut on Amazon Prime Video on August 15, 2025. While there's no official confirmation yet, it is suggested that the streaming deal is in place, and the film might drop in multiple languages, including Kannada and Telugu, with possible dubs in other Indian languages.‘Sitaare Zameen Par’: Riteish Deshmukh’s Emotional Shoutout For Genelia’s Big WinBox office collectionReleased on Jul 18, 'Junior' managed to net Rs 7.65 crore in India and gross Rs 9.5 crore worldwide, as per data from trade analyst Sacnilk. The film drew decent footfalls from mass audiences, thanks to its action sequences and high-energy dance numbers, but struggled to hold universal appeal due to its predictable storyline.Early Twitter reviewsTwitter reviews at the time of the release suggested mixed opinions. Several viewers praised Kireeti's confidence and dancing skills in the film, calling his debut a fair representation of the debutant in the first half. Nonetheless, some felt that the story wasn't anything new and that its treatment and narrative construction felt outdated.Despite the predictable plot, certain performances stood out. Sreeleela was widely appreciated for bringing her trademark energy and charm to the screen, especially in the first half. Her dance numbers were singled out as major crowd-pullers. Genelia Deshmukh, stepping back into Telugu films after a long hiatus, was also appreciated by fans.The supporting cast included veteran actors like V. Ravi Chandran, Rao Ramesh, Sudharani, Achyut Rao, Satya, and Viva Harsha.The music of the film was composed by Devi Sri Prasad.

While she delivered numerous memorable roles, Sridevi considered 'Mr. India,' directed by Shekhar Kapur, as her finest work.  Bollywood has always been blessed with talents that left a lasting impression not just on the cinematic landscape but also on the hearts of the audience. And one such talented artist who charmed all with her unmatched screen presence, sheer beauty, and the ability to evolve with time and every genre was Sridevi. Unfortunately, Sridevi is no longer among us, but even today, her work, her words, and her perspective towards life and cinema continue to inspire. Sridevi called THIS movie her best filmOver her illustrious career, Sridevi worked not just in Bollywood, but also in Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada cinema. From ‘Chandni’ to ‘ChaalBaaz,’ ‘Lamhe’ to ‘English Vinglish,’ her every film created a different magical spell, which made everyone fall for her and her craft. For her fans, each of her movies is nothing short of a masterpiece, but for Sridevi, there was one film that was special, which she called her best work.Poonam Dhillon Calls Sridevi ‘Brilliant’, Slams ‘Dumb’ Tag As UnfairAnd that movie is none other than ‘Mr India.’ Speaking about the movie and the director, Shekhar Kapur, in an old interview with Colors Cineplex, Sridevi mentioned, "In every film for an artist, it is the director who plays the biggest role. We were spontaneous, but it was the director who helped. For instance, I have worked with Shekhar Kapur, and I really enjoyed my experience in Mr India. It was my best film, I can say. Because that's the first film that was different from a glamorous role. People started talking, of course, I think she can also act."In the same conversation, she vividly remembered the famous Charlie Chaplin scene, which was originally intended to be a small part of the film. However, after Sridevi got all dressed in her costume and started her performance, Shekhar Kapur was so taken aback by her talent. He turned it into a significant comedic moment, one that continues to delight audiences even many years later.Sridevi birthday special: The actress who will always remain our ‘Chandni’About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

New study warns! Routine AI use may affect doctors’ tumor diagnostic skills by 20%
Artificial Intelligence is changing healthcare. It helps in early disease detection and treatment. A recent study shows doctors may lose skills if they depend too much on AI. When AI support was removed, doctors' tumor detection skills dropped. Experts suggest using AI as a support tool, not a replacement.

It helps in early disease detection and treatment. A recent study shows doctors may lose skills if they depend too much on AI. When AI support was removed, doctors' tumor detection skills dropped. Experts suggest using AI as a support tool, not a replacement. Regular training and critical thinking are important to maintain skills.   Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare, offering tools that improve early disease detection, diagnostic accuracy, and treatment planning. AI-assisted systems can help clinicians identify conditions such as pre-cancerous growths or subtle anomalies that might be missed otherwise, boosting patient outcomes and overall clinical efficiency. However, recent research highlights a potential downside: excessive reliance on AI may lead to skill erosion among healthcare professionals. Even experienced doctors who regularly use AI tools may find their independent decision-making and observational abilities decline over time. AI has the potential to transform medicine, improve patient outcomes, and streamline healthcare workflows. However, the recent study serves as a reminder that over-reliance on technology can erode critical skills, even among experienced doctors. A balanced approach—where AI supports rather than replaces human judgment—is essential for sustaining both high-quality patient care and professional expertise.Doctors’ ability to spot pre-cancerous growths declines when AI is removedA recent study in The Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology, investigated how AI impacts colonoscopy performance. The researchers found that AI assistance enabled doctors to detect pre-cancerous growths in the colon more effectively, potentially preventing progression to colorectal cancer.However, a concerning trend emerged: when AI support was removed, doctors’ ability to detect tumors dropped by approximately 20%, even compared with rates recorded before AI introduction. This suggests that clinicians may unconsciously rely on AI cues, reducing their independent observational skills.Global adoption of AI in healthcare systemsHealthcare systems worldwide are increasingly investing in AI technology. AI is being positioned as a tool to boost diagnostic accuracy, improve workflow efficiency, and enhance patient safety.For instance, in 2025, the British government announced £11 million (S$19 million) in funding for a trial exploring how AI can facilitate earlier breast cancer detection. While AI offers promising benefits, these developments highlight the importance of maintaining human expertise alongside technological advancements.Doctors losing skills due to AI dependence: Here’s what the study foundThe study revealed that AI can inadvertently encourage over-reliance, even among highly skilled clinicians. According to the research paper, AI support can result in doctors becoming less motivated, less focused, and less responsible when making decisions independently.The researchers studied four endoscopy centers in Poland, comparing colonoscopy detection rates three months before and after AI implementation. The procedures were randomized: some were performed with AI guidance, others without. The difference in detection rates highlighted the risk of skill erosion caused by dependency on AI tools.AI can reduce tumor detection skills in expert doctorsInterestingly, the study participants were 19 highly experienced doctors, each with over 2,000 colonoscopies completed. Despite their expertise, AI still affected their ability to detect tumors without assistance.Professor Yuichi Mori, one of the study authors from the University of Oslo, warned that skill degradation could worsen as AI becomes more sophisticated.Dr. Omer Ahmad, a gastroenterologist at University College Hospital London, added:“Although AI continues to offer great promise to enhance clinical outcomes, we must also safeguard against the quiet erosion of fundamental skills required for high-quality endoscopy.”He noted that the effect could be more pronounced for trainees or novice doctors, who might become overly dependent on AI before mastering essential diagnostic skills.Excessive AI use may reduce brain engagement and focus; study revealsConcerns about over-reliance on AI extend beyond healthcare. A 2025 MIT study found that students using OpenAI’s ChatGPT to write essays demonstrated less cognitive engagement and brain activity, illustrating how AI can unintentionally reduce critical thinking skills.These findings underscore the need for balanced AI integration—leveraging AI’s advantages while ensuring that human expertise and cognitive abilities remain intact.Strategies to maintain skills while using AITo mitigate skill erosion, healthcare professionals and institutions can adopt several strategies:AI as a support tool, not a replacement – Use AI to assist decisions while maintaining independent judgment.Regular performance monitoring – Track detection accuracy with and without AI to identify skill gaps.Structured training rotations – Alternate between AI-assisted and manual procedures to preserve proficiency.Active critical thinking – Encourage clinicians to question and evaluate AI suggestions rather than blindly following them.Continuous education – Reinforce fundamental diagnostic skills through workshops and refresher courses.By implementing these measures, healthcare systems can maximise AI’s benefits while safeguarding essential clinical competencies.Disclaimer: The information presented in this article is for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

Tension, sinus, and cluster headaches each have unique characteristics and triggers. Seeking medical advice is crucial for severe or worsening headaches, enabling accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plans, alongside lifestyle adjustments, to effectively manage these conditions.  Headaches affect millions worldwide, but not all headaches are the same. Migraines are a unique neurological disorder, often confused with common headaches, leading to misdiagnosis and ineffective treatment. Unlike typical headaches, migraines cause intense, throbbing pain, often accompanied by symptoms like nausea, sensitivity to light and sound, and visual disturbances. Understanding the key differences between migraines and tension or cluster headaches is essential for accurate diagnosis and effective migraine treatment. Recognising migraine symptoms early can significantly improve quality of life and help manage this debilitating condition with proper medical care and lifestyle changes.How to differentiate migraine and headachesWhile migraines and common headaches both involve head pain, they differ significantly in their causes, symptoms, and severity. Decode Your Migraines: Understanding Common Triggers And SolutionsMigraines are a neurological condition characterised by intense, often throbbing pain on one side of the head, accompanied by symptoms like nausea, sensitivity to light and sound, and visual disturbances known as aura. In contrast, typical headaches such as tension headaches usually present as a milder, steady, band-like pressure around the head without these additional symptoms. What is a migraineMigraines are intense, recurring headaches accompanied by additional symptoms beyond just pain. They can last from 4 to 72 hours and are often debilitating.Common characteristics of migraines include:One-sided pain: Typically throbbing or pulsating, often on one side of the head.Aura: Visual disturbances such as flashing lights, zigzag lines, or blind spots that occur before the headache.Sensitivity: Increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), sound (phonophobia), and sometimes smells.Nausea and vomiting: Often accompany the headache phase.Other symptoms: Fatigue, dizziness, and difficulty concentrating.Common triggers include hormonal changes (e.g., menstruation), stress, certain foods and drinks (like caffeine or alcohol), dehydration, and changes in sleep patterns.What is a tension headacheTension headaches are the most common type of headache and are generally less severe than migraines.Key features:Pain description: A steady, dull, tightening or pressing sensation, often described as a "band" around the forehead or the back of the head and neck.Pain intensity: Mild to moderate.Duration: Lasts from 30 minutes to several hours, sometimes even days.Associated symptoms: Usually no nausea or vomiting; sensitivity to light or sound is rare.Triggers often include stress, poor posture, anxiety, fatigue, and muscle strain.Sinus headacheSinus headaches arise from inflammation or infection in the sinuses and often accompany sinusitis.Symptoms include:Pain and pressure: Felt around the forehead, cheeks, and eyes.Other symptoms: Nasal congestion, thick nasal discharge, fever, and fatigue.Sinus headaches are often mistaken for migraines but usually resolve with treatment of the underlying sinus infection.Cluster headacheCluster headaches are relatively rare but extremely painful headaches that occur in cyclical patterns or clusters.Characteristics include:Pain location: Severe, burning or piercing pain around one eye or temple.Duration: Usually last between 15 minutes and 3 hours.Frequency: Can occur multiple times a day during cluster periods.Associated symptoms: Red or watery eye, nasal congestion or runny nose on the affected side, drooping eyelid.Cluster headaches often occur in seasonal patterns and may be triggered by alcohol or strong smells.How to know when to see a doctorSeek medical advice if you experience:A sudden, severe headache unlike any before.Headaches that worsen or become more frequent.Headaches accompanied by neurological symptoms such as vision changes, weakness, difficulty speaking, or confusion.Headaches that interfere significantly with daily activities.Headaches following a head injury.Diagnosis and treatmentDiagnosis usually involves:A detailed medical history and description of symptoms.Physical and neurological examinations.Sometimes imaging tests like MRI or CT scans to rule out other causes.Treatment options vary depending on the headache typeMigraines: Pain relief with over-the-counter medications, triptans, anti-nausea drugs; preventive medications; lifestyle and dietary changes.Tension headaches: Painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen, stress reduction techniques, improved posture.Sinus headaches: Treating the underlying infection with decongestants, antihistamines, or antibiotics if necessary.Cluster headaches: Fast-acting treatments like oxygen therapy, triptans, and preventive medications prescribed by specialists.Lifestyle tips to manage headaches and migrainesMaintain a regular sleep schedule.Stay hydrated.Manage stress through relaxation techniques such as meditation or yoga.Avoid known triggers, such as specific foods or environmental factors.Engage in regular physical exercise.Keep a headache diary to identify patterns and triggers.Disclaimer: This article is intended for informational purposes only and does not replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

How gout increases your risk of developing type 2 diabetes: Know the link between the two
Gout and type 2 diabetes often coexist, exacerbating metabolic health issues through shared risk factors like obesity and poor diet. Insulin resistance links these conditions, impacting glucose metabolism and uric acid excretion. Managing both effectively requires lifestyle adjustments, including diet, exercise, hydration, and smart medication choices to mitigate long-term cardiovascular and kidney risks.

Insulin resistance links these conditions, impacting glucose metabolism and uric acid excretion. Managing both effectively requires lifestyle adjustments, including diet, exercise, hydration, and smart medication choices to mitigate long-term cardiovascular and kidney risks.  Gout and type 2 diabetes frequently occur together, creating a cycle that can significantly harm metabolic health. Gout results from the buildup of uric acid crystals in the joints, causing severe inflammation and pain. Type 2 diabetes is characterised by insulin resistance and elevated blood sugar levels. Both conditions share common risk factors, including excess body weight, diets high in sugar and processed foods, and a lack of physical activity. Understanding the connection between gout and diabetes is crucial for effective management, helping to prevent complications and improve overall health and quality of life.Understanding gout and diabetesGoutGout occurs when excess uric acid in the blood forms sharp crystals in the joints. This can trigger intense inflammation, causing severe pain and discomfort. Uric acid is a waste product generated from the breakdown of purines, substances found naturally in the body and certain foods. When the body produces too much uric acid or cannot eliminate it efficiently through the kidneys, levels build up, leading to gout. DiabetesDiabetes is a chronic condition that affects how your body processes blood sugar (glucose), which is a vital energy source. In type 2 diabetes, the most common form, the body becomes resistant to insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. Over time, this leads to elevated glucose in the blood, which can cause damage to organs, nerves, and blood vessels. The link between gout and type 2 diabetesExtensive studies show that individuals diagnosed with gout face a substantially higher likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes than those without. The persistent inflammation and elevated uric acid levels in gout contribute to metabolic disturbances that impair insulin sensitivity. Over time, chronic inflammation can interfere with glucose metabolism, making blood sugar control more difficult. This impact is particularly pronounced in women, who often show a stronger correlation between gout and future diabetes. By understanding this risk, healthcare providers can prioritise early monitoring and preventive strategies.How insulin resistance connects diabetes with goutA key link between gout and diabetes lies in insulin resistance. Uric acid appears to disrupt insulin signalling, reducing the body’s ability to use glucose effectively and paving the way for elevated blood sugar. Concurrently, insulin resistance impairs uric acid excretion by the kidneys, elevating uric acid levels and promoting gout attacks. Both conditions also involve overlapping genetic predispositions, genes that influence fat metabolism, inflammation, and the handling of uric acid and glucose often overlap, creating a biological bridge between the two disorders.When diabetes might lower your gout riskInterestingly, the relationship isn’t completely one-way. Certain forms of diabetes, particularly less-managed type 1 diabetes in men, seem to be linked with a lower incidence of gout. One theory suggests that high blood sugar levels may suppress inflammatory responses, thereby reducing the risk of gout flares. That said, this potential protective effect must be balanced against the long-term complications of poorly controlled diabetes, such as cardiovascular and kidney damage.Managing gout and diabetes effectivelyA unified strategy can help manage both gout and diabetes simultaneously, here’s how:1. Maintain a healthy weight and stay activeExcess body weight promotes both insulin resistance and uric acid build-up. Regular moderate exercise, such as brisk walking, swimming, or cycling, helps improve insulin sensitivity and aids in maintaining healthy uric acid levels through daily sweating.2. Embrace a balanced, low‑purine dietFocus on whole foods rich in fibre, lean protein, and low-glycaemic starches. Limit intake of purine-heavy foods like red meat, shellfish, and sugary beverages, which can trigger gout attacks and destabilise blood sugar. 3. Prioritise hydrationAdequate hydration supports kidney function and uric acid elimination. Drinking water throughout the day helps dilute serum uric acid and may prevent crystal formation in joints.4. Smart medication choicesSome medications used to manage diabetes offer additional benefits by promoting uric acid excretion. When prescribing for patients with both gout and diabetes, physicians may also consider adjusting uric acid-lowering therapies like allopurinol or febuxostat alongside blood glucose management drugs.Why this mattersBoth gout and diabetes significantly raise the risk of developing cardiovascular and kidney disease. Having both conditions amplifies that danger. By understanding how they interact and tackling both through lifestyle changes, informed medication use, and regular monitoring, patients and clinicians can greatly reduce long-term complications and improve quality of life.Disclaimer: This information is provided for educational purposes only and is not intended to replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

87-year-old Sheila Isaacs reveals her one true love for staying healthy
Sheila Isaacs’ story is a reminder that movement is not just about physical benefits; it’s a way to keep the spirit alive. Whether it’s pedalling down a country lane or cycling by an open garage door, the joy of the ride can be the best medicine of all.

For Sheila Isaacs, it meant gearing up, literally. Now 87, Sheila has been competing in triathlons for over 35 years, and the one activity that has stolen her heart is cycling. It’s more than just exercise for her, it’s joy, freedom, and the key to staying strong well into her 80s.In a recent interview with Women’s Health, Sheila shared how her love for cycling has evolved over the years and why it continues to keep her fit. But what exactly makes cycling such a powerful tool for healthy ageing? 2/6Cycling through the yearsSheila’s relationship with cycling has changed with age. In her 80s, tall racing bikes became harder to mount, so she switched to a shorter stationary bike indoors, still positioned by the open garage door to soak in fresh air and outdoor views.Modifying workouts with age isn’t quitting, it’s smart training. As joints become more sensitive, high-impact activities like running can strain knees and hips. Switching to a low-impact activity like cycling helps maintain cardiovascular health without overloading the joints. It’s a practical example of the saying: “Train smarter, not harder.”3/6Why cycling keeps the body youngerCycling isn’t just a leg workout. It engages the core, improves balance, and boosts cardiovascular endurance. Sheila alternates cycling days with swimming and weightlifting, which keeps her muscles challenged and prevents overuse injuries.According to studies, regular cycling helps maintain bone density, muscle mass, and coordination, all of which naturally decline with age. The steady pedalling motion also promotes better blood circulation, which supports brain function and lowers the risk of age-related cognitive decline.4/6The science of fun and longevitySheila admits that her biggest shift came when she stopped stressing over races and simply started enjoying them. To her, race day is “a swim, a bike ride, and a walk.” That mindset has kept her going for decades.​Researchers have found that people who exercise for enjoyment, not obligation, are far more likely to stick to it long-term. Fun releases dopamine and endorphins, the “happy hormones” that not only lift mood but also reduce inflammation, one of the key factors in age-related diseases.5/6Tracking progress without obsessionSheila has been logging her workouts for 30 years, time, distance, mileage, and even how she feels. This habit helps her adjust training when her joints feel sore and ensures she never pushes beyond healthy limits.Fitness tracking isn’t about chasing numbers; it’s about listening to the body. Studies show that self-monitoring increases awareness of physical limits, which lowers the risk of injury and improves long-term adherence to exercise. It’s the difference between exercising for a few years and exercising for a lifetime.6/6The lesson in Sheila’s pedal powerSheila’s cycling story isn’t just about stamina; it’s about adaptability, joy, and community. At her 200th triathlon, she raced alongside her daughter and granddaughter. Her goal? Not winning, but finishing healthy and happy.This outlook aligns with what longevity experts often say: social connections and meaningful activities are as vital as physical fitness for a long, healthy life. Cycling has given Sheila both a reason to move and a circle of fellow athletes to share it with.[Disclaimer: This article is based on Sheila Isaacs’ personal experience as shared with Women’s Health. Cycling has many proven health benefits, but exercise routines should be tailored to individual needs and medical conditions. Always seek professional advice before starting or modifying any fitness program.]Follow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousSet up a mini lotus pond at home with these easy tipsindiaJanmashtami 2025: How to make Makhana Paag at home forChhappan BhogFoodAttractive looks of Srithika SaneeshindiaSheet masks out, Kareena Kapoor Khan’s DIY napkin mask inindia10 creatures that can walk on waterindia​Bhagyashri Borse charms with her gorgeous outfits​indiaThese Zodiac Signs Play the Victim When They’re Actually in Controlindia10 things to know before getting a pet rabbitindiaThe Great Indian saf​ari: 9 wildlife trips beyond tigers and leopardstravel Next123 Photostories  Labrador Retriever vs Beagle: Which is a better pet dog for families with children?5 saree tips to take from South Indian 'saree queen' Samantha Ruth PrabhuHer longevity secret? 87-year-old Sheila Isaacs reveals her one true love for staying healthyCooku With Comali 6: From Shabana Shajahan to Lakshmy Ramakrishnan – Meet the top 6 cooks of the season​'Coolie': Five big reasons to experience Rajinikanth and Lokesh Kanagaraj’s film on the big screenAnanya Panday moments that show her unstoppable rise to stardomDesi face masks which promise a glowing skin7 brain-boosting foods every child should eat and quick recipesFrom reunion with Asit Kumar Modi to unseen pictures: Times when Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah’s Disha Vakani aka Dayaben made headlines123lifestyle videos13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement16:34Life After 60: Why India's seniors are choosing community living04:34Control Your Senses, Gain Knowledge, Attain Peace: Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4.3906:37Cultural Clashes in Love: How To Make Your Relationship Work03:19Prayagraj MahaKumbh 2025 Readies For Millions: Massive Preparations Underway In Uttar Pradesh04:48Sadhguru Reveals The Truth About Black Magic And Your Photograph07:18BK Shivani On Forgiveness: Why It’s Essential For Inner Peace08:08How Bhairavi Sadhana Accelerates Your Path to Liberation: Sadhguru Speaks06:47Breakup Recovery: How To Not Wallow In Misery And Love Yourself03:20The Purifying Power of Yajna: Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4, Verse 3011:41How Dattatreya Accepted Parashuram as His Disciple – Sadhguru Reveals03:54Can Water Remember?

Can your daily cup of coffee or tea boost your mood? Science weighs in
Research indicates that morning caffeine intake, from coffee or tea, can significantly boost positive emotions like alertness and enthusiasm. This effect is most pronounced shortly after waking and is influenced by factors such as sleep quality and social environment. Therefore, a mindful morning beverage routine can enhance mood and set a positive tone for the day.

This effect is most pronounced shortly after waking and is influenced by factors such as sleep quality and social environment. Therefore, a mindful morning beverage routine can enhance mood and set a positive tone for the day.  Starting your day with a cup of coffee or tea is a cherished ritual for millions worldwide, often believed to enhance mood, increase alertness, and provide an energising start to the morning. But how much of this is backed by science? Recent research published in Scientific Reports sheds light on the connection between caffeine consumption and emotional states in everyday life. The study indicates that caffeine intake can produce a small-to-moderate increase in positive emotions, particularly when enjoyed shortly after waking.Interestingly, these mood-boosting effects are most pronounced in the morning and can be influenced by factors such as fatigue levels, sleep quality, and social environment. The research suggests that the familiar comfort and routine of your morning cup, whether coffee or tea, may not only awaken your senses but also subtly improve your emotional well-being. This article delves into the science behind why that morning brew might be more than just a pick-me-up, exploring its effects on mood, alertness, and overall mental state throughout the day.Understanding the impact of morning coffee on moodCoffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages globally, cherished not only for its bold flavor but also for its stimulating and mood-enhancing effects. According to the study, drinking coffee shortly after waking can significantly boost positive emotions such as alertness, enthusiasm, and motivation. This suggests that your morning cup does more than just shake off sleepiness, it provides a mental lift that can help you feel more focused, productive, and optimistic throughout the morning.Interestingly, the study also notes that the mood-enhancing effects of coffee are influenced by factors like sleep quality, social context, and general fatigue levels, meaning that a well-timed cup in the right environment can maximize its benefits. This adds scientific support to the daily ritual many people swear by, showing that your morning brew can be a subtle but effective tool for improving both your mental and emotional wellbeing. Incorporating coffee thoughtfully into your routine may therefore not only jumpstart your day physically but also set a positive tone for your mindset and overall productivity.Does tea consumption enhance emotional well-being?Tea lovers have reason to celebrate too. Like coffee, tea contains caffeine, albeit in smaller amounts, and research shows that drinking tea can also lead to modest improvements in positive emotions, especially when enjoyed in the morning. Beyond caffeine, green and black teas are rich in L-theanine, an amino acid that promotes relaxation, enhances focus, and helps reduce stress. This unique combination of caffeine and L-theanine allows tea to gently boost alertness while keeping the mind calm, making it a perfect morning companion for both mental clarity and a subtle mood lift.Timing your caffeine intake for optimal mood boostTiming is a critical factor in harnessing the full mood-boosting effects of caffeine. According to the study, consuming coffee or tea within the first 2.5 hours after waking leads to a more pronounced increase in positive emotions, including alertness, enthusiasm, and overall mental sharpness. In contrast, caffeine intake later in the day, around 10–12 hours after waking, tends to have a much smaller impact on emotional state, offering minimal mood benefits. This highlights the importance of making your morning beverage an intentional part of your routine rather than just a habit.By enjoying coffee or tea early, you not only energize your body but also enhance your emotional wellbeing, giving your mind a natural lift that can improve focus, motivation, and productivity throughout the morning. Combining the caffeine boost with your usual morning rituals, like a nutritious breakfast or light exercise, can further amplify these effects, making your early hours more productive and mentally uplifting. Ultimately, the timing of your caffeine intake can play a key role in setting a positive tone for the rest of your day.Factors influencing the effectiveness of morning tea or coffeeSeveral factors can modulate how caffeine affects your mood:Tiredness: Those who are sleep-deprived or fatigued may experience stronger positive effects from caffeine.Social Context: Enjoying coffee or tea with friends or colleagues can enhance the mood-boosting effects.Individual Differences: Genetics, habitual caffeine intake, and personal sensitivity can influence results.These factors suggest that the mood benefits of coffee or tea are not solely due to caffeine itself but also the environment and personal habits surrounding its consumption.Scientific insights into caffeine's role in mood regulationThe research emphasizes that caffeine primarily boosts positive emotions, including enthusiasm, energy, and alertness, while having little effect on negative emotions such as sadness or anxiety. This finding supports what millions of coffee and tea drinkers have long observed: that their morning cup can leave them feeling more motivated, cheerful, and ready to tackle the day. By enhancing these uplifting emotions without significantly altering negative moods, caffeine offers a subtle but meaningful way to improve daily mental and emotional wellbeing.Your morning coffee or tea can indeed provide a natural mood boost, especially when consumed shortly after waking. The positive effects are most noticeable in the early hours of the day and can be influenced by fatigue levels, social settings, and individual sensitivity. By enjoying your beverage mindfully and at the right time, you can enhance your morning mood and start your day on a more positive note.Also read| Drinking ginger tea daily?

Whether she’s walking the red carpet, attending a temple visit, or promoting her latest film, Samantha has this uncanny ability to make a six-yard drape feel fresh, current, and endlessly stylish. Her Instagram alone is practically a mood board for anyone who wants to give their saree game a serious upgrade.Here’s how to take a few lessons from Samantha’s playbook and turn the humble saree into your ultimate style weapon.by TOI Lifestyle Desk 2/7​Master the art of mixing texturesOne thing Samantha does better than most is pairing contrasting textures in a way that feels intentional and luxe. You will often spot her wearing a crisp organza saree with a raw silk blouse, or a matte cotton drape with a metallic brocade blouse.The trick? The fabrics should talk to each other, not compete. If the saree has a soft, flowy drape, she’ll go for a blouse with more structure. If the saree is rich and heavy, she’ll balance it with a simpler, lighter blouse.For us mere mortals, this means stepping outside the matching-set mindset. That Kanjeevaram in your cupboard? Try pairing it with a velvet blouse for winter weddings. Got a breezy linen saree? Give it some shine with a sequin or mirror-work blouse.3/7Play with unconventional blouse stylesIf there’s one thing Samantha has taught us, it’s that the blouse can make (or break) your saree look. She isn’t afraid of experimenting, from strappy corset-style cholis to high-neck blouses with dramatic sleeves.The magic is in balancing the mood of the event with the blouse design. For traditional festivities, she leans towards elbow-length sleeves and heritage necklines. For fashion-forward occasions, she isn’t shy about trying halter necks, off-shoulder cuts, or even capes as a blouse alternative.The lesson? Think beyond the regular tailor-cut blouse. Raid Pinterest for ideas, mix in some contemporary silhouettes, and let the blouse set the tone for your entire look.4/7​Keep your jewellery intentionalSamantha’s saree looks are never weighed down with jewellery just for the sake of it. If she’s wearing a heavy, embellished saree, she’ll often let it breathe with just statement earrings. On the flip side, with simpler drapes like a plain tussar or organza, she’ll turn up the drama with chunky temple jewellery or layered necklaces.It’s about intention, not excess. Every piece she wears feels like it belongs, creating harmony instead of visual chaos.If you are styling your own saree, take a beat before reaching for the whole jewellery box. Ask yourself: is the saree the hero or the accessories? Then edit accordingly. Sometimes, less sparkle equals more impact.5/7​Nail the drape for the occasionFrom a crisp corporate pallu for a business event to a loose, casual drape for a day wedding, Samantha always tailors her saree pleats to the moment. She even experiments with belt-cinched sarees for a modern twist, a trick that works wonders for creating shape and adding a little edge.The biggest takeaway here is to treat your saree drape like styling hair or makeup: adapt it to the vibe. A tight, structured drape works for formal occasions, while a relaxed, low-pleat version feels more laid-back and bohemian.Pro tip: if you’re wearing the saree all day, make sure the pleats are pinned securely (a mishap mid-event is never chic). Samantha’s looks always appear effortless because they’re also practical, no tugging or adjusting every five minutes.6/7Let the saree reflect your moodPerhaps Samantha’s most important saree lesson is that she doesn’t wear it like a costume, she wears it like an extension of herself. Some days it’s a blush-pink floral drape that screams romantic and whimsical. Other days, it’s a strong, deep-coloured silk that says, “I mean business.”Fashion is personal, and the saree is one of the most adaptable garments in the world. Feeling playful? Go for bright colours, quirky prints, or ruffled edges. In a minimalist mood? Choose muted tones with subtle detailing.The point is: the saree isn’t just for weddings, pujas, or “special” days. Samantha wears hers to red carpets, movie promotions, and even casual brunches, proving that this centuries-old garment is as everyday-friendly as jeans if you style it right.7/7Magic of Samantha's sareesSamantha Ruth Prabhu’s saree style is the perfect blend of tradition and experimentation. She respects the garment’s heritage but refuses to treat it as untouchable. Instead, she makes it personal, modern, and infinitely wearable.So the next time you’re staring at your saree collection wondering how to make it feel fresh, remember: mix textures, play with blouse styles, be intentional with jewellery, drape for the occasion, and above all, let the saree reflect you.The magic of Samantha’s saree looks isn’t in the price tags or designer labels, it’s in the way she wears them with confidence and joy. And that, more than any styling trick, is the ultimate tip worth stealing.Follow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousSet up a mini lotus pond at home with these easy tipsindiaJanmashtami 2025: How to make Makhana Paag at home forChhappan BhogFoodAttractive looks of Srithika SaneeshindiaSheet masks out, Kareena Kapoor Khan’s DIY napkin mask inindia10 creatures that can walk on waterindia​Bhagyashri Borse charms with her gorgeous outfits​indiaThese Zodiac Signs Play the Victim When They’re Actually in Controlindia10 things to know before getting a pet rabbitindiaThe Great Indian saf​ari: 9 wildlife trips beyond tigers and leopardstravel Next123 Photostories  Cooku With Comali 6: From Shabana Shajahan to Lakshmy Ramakrishnan – Meet the top 6 cooks of the season​'Coolie': Five big reasons to experience Rajinikanth and Lokesh Kanagaraj’s film on the big screenAnanya Panday moments that show her unstoppable rise to stardomDesi face masks which promise a glowing skin7 brain-boosting foods every child should eat and quick recipesFrom reunion with Asit Kumar Modi to unseen pictures: Times when Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah’s Disha Vakani aka Dayaben made headlinesFrom Gokarna to Varkala — 8 beautiful coastal towns of India that are a must-visit in this lifetime8.5 quintals of adulterated mawa seized in Hisar: 5 ways to do mawa purity test at homeThis is what happens when you drink fennel tea on an empty stomach123lifestyle videos13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement16:34Life After 60: Why India's seniors are choosing community living04:34Control Your Senses, Gain Knowledge, Attain Peace: Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4.3906:37Cultural Clashes in Love: How To Make Your Relationship Work03:19Prayagraj MahaKumbh 2025 Readies For Millions: Massive Preparations Underway In Uttar Pradesh04:48Sadhguru Reveals The Truth About Black Magic And Your Photograph07:18BK Shivani On Forgiveness: Why It’s Essential For Inner Peace08:08How Bhairavi Sadhana Accelerates Your Path to Liberation: Sadhguru Speaks06:47Breakup Recovery: How To Not Wallow In Misery And Love Yourself03:20The Purifying Power of Yajna: Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4, Verse 3011:41How Dattatreya Accepted Parashuram as His Disciple – Sadhguru Reveals03:54Can Water Remember?

Do you have children and are thinking which popular pet dog is better-- Labrador Retriever or Beagle? Well, Labrador Retrievers and Beagles are two of the most popular breeds across the world, and both are known for their friendliness and playfulness. However, they do have certain differences that can make one dog breed more suitable for your household than the other, depending on your needs. So, here we list some key differences between the two that will help you select the right pet dog for you:2/8TemperamentLabrador Retrievers are known for being gentle, fun-loving, and patient— which makes them perfect pets for families with kids of all ages. Beagles too are friendly and playful, but they have a stronger independent streak, which can make them a bit mischievous.3/8Size and space needsThis is one of the most striing differences between the two pet dog breeds. Labradors are large and they need more space to move freely; and so, they are more suitable for people with large homes and bungalows. Whereas, due to their small size Beagles are perfect pets for people living in apartments or smaller homes.4/8Energy levelsBoth Labradors and Beagles are active, when it comes to their energy levels. But Labs need more structured exercise and outdoor play to stay active and healthy. Whereas, Beagles have bursts of high energy but can be happy with regular short walks and play sessions too.5/8 Grooming and sheddingBoth Labs and Beagles shed moderately. However, Labradors may shed a bit more seasonally. On the contrary, due to their short coats,  Beagles are easier to groom and maintain. Both the dog breeds need regular brushing to keep their coats clean and healthy.6/8TrainabilityDue to their people pleasing nature, Labradors respond well to training and positive reinforcement. This makes them great pets even for first-time owners. Beagles, on the other hand, are intelligent but can also be stubborn. And so, a person needs to handle them with a lot of patience and consistent positive reinforcement.7/8Health issuesLabradors are known to be more prone to joint issues like hip dysplasia. Meanwhile Beagles are prone to ear infections due to their floppy ears. Both the dog breeds need regular vet care to ensure they stay healthy.8/8Compatibility with kids Labradors are known for their patience and tolerance, which makes them perfect for younger children. While Beagles are equally affectionate, they may be better with slightly older kids who can match their playful energy and need for independence too at times.Follow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: How to make Makhana Paag at home forChhappan BhogFoodAttractive looks of Srithika SaneeshindiaSheet masks out, Kareena Kapoor Khan’s DIY napkin mask inindia10 creatures that can walk on waterindia​Bhagyashri Borse charms with her gorgeous outfits​indiaThese Zodiac Signs Play the Victim When They’re Actually in Controlindia10 things to know before getting a pet rabbitindiaThe Great Indian saf​ari: 9 wildlife trips beyond tigers and leopardstravelDiarrhea: What to eat and avoid when the stomach is upsetindia Next123 Photostories  Cooku With Comali 6: From Shabana Shajahan to Lakshmy Ramakrishnan – Meet the top 6 cooks of the season​'Coolie': Five big reasons to experience Rajinikanth and Lokesh Kanagaraj’s film on the big screenAnanya Panday moments that show her unstoppable rise to stardomDesi face masks which promise a glowing skin7 brain-boosting foods every child should eat and quick recipesFrom reunion with Asit Kumar Modi to unseen pictures: Times when Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah’s Disha Vakani aka Dayaben made headlinesFrom Gokarna to Varkala — 8 beautiful coastal towns of India that are a must-visit in this lifetime8.5 quintals of adulterated mawa seized in Hisar: 5 ways to do mawa purity test at homeThis is what happens when you drink fennel tea on an empty stomach123lifestyle videos13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement16:34Life After 60: Why India's seniors are choosing community living04:34Control Your Senses, Gain Knowledge, Attain Peace: Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4.3906:37Cultural Clashes in Love: How To Make Your Relationship Work03:19Prayagraj MahaKumbh 2025 Readies For Millions: Massive Preparations Underway In Uttar Pradesh04:48Sadhguru Reveals The Truth About Black Magic And Your Photograph07:18BK Shivani On Forgiveness: Why It’s Essential For Inner Peace08:08How Bhairavi Sadhana Accelerates Your Path to Liberation: Sadhguru Speaks06:47Breakup Recovery: How To Not Wallow In Misery And Love Yourself03:20The Purifying Power of Yajna: Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4, Verse 3011:41How Dattatreya Accepted Parashuram as His Disciple – Sadhguru Reveals03:54Can Water Remember?

This guide offers quick solutions to reduce its size and redness overnight. It combines natural remedies like tea tree oil and aloe vera with over-the-counter treatments containing salicylic acid. Also, it emphasizes the importance of gentle skincare and avoiding harsh treatments to protect your skin's health.  Waking up with a pimple can be incredibly frustrating, especially when you have an important meeting, party, or photoshoot lined up. That angry red bump can feel like it’s stealing all the attention, and the urge to make it disappear instantly is understandable. While completely eliminating a pimple overnight is nearly impossible, there are tried-and-tested methods to significantly reduce its size, redness, and inflammation in just a few hours. By combining natural ingredients, simple home treatments, and targeted over-the-counter products, you can calm irritation, shrink swelling, and make your skin look noticeably smoother by morning.The key lies in choosing remedies that work quickly without damaging your skin barrier because harsh treatments can sometimes make things worse. From ice therapy and spot treatments to soothing herbal options, there are safe, effective ways to give your skin the overnight boost it needs. Here’s a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to remove pimples overnight while protecting your skin’s health.Natural remedies to remove pimples overnightTea tree oil spot treatmentStudies by NIH show that tea tree oil is a potent antibacterial and anti-inflammatory agent. It helps fight the bacteria that cause pimples, reduces redness, soothes swelling, and can accelerate the healing process, making breakouts less noticeable and preventing future flare-ups when used correctly.How to use: Dilute a few drops in a carrier oil like coconut or jojoba oil. Apply directly to the affected area before bedtime.Aloe vera gelResearch done by NIH confirms that aloe vera is renowned for its soothing and anti-inflammatory properties. Applying fresh aloe gel to pimples can calm redness, reduce swelling, and promote healing overnight.How to use: Extract fresh gel from an aloe leaf and apply a thin layer to the pimple before sleeping. Wash off in the morning with lukewarm water.Ice compressCold therapy is an easy way to reduce puffiness and redness. Ice constricts blood vessels and reduces inflammation.How to use: Wrap a small ice cube in a clean cloth and gently press it against the pimple for 3–5 minutes. Repeat 2–3 times.Honey and cinnamon maskAccording to research published in Research Gate, honey and cinnamon have natural antibacterial and antimicrobial properties. Together, they can help fight bacteria and soothe irritated skin.How to use: Mix 1 teaspoon of honey with ½ teaspoon of cinnamon to form a paste. Apply directly to the pimple and leave it on overnight. Wash off in the morning.Over-the-counter spot treatmentsProducts containing salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide are widely recommended by dermatologists. They work by unclogging pores, drying out excess oil, and killing bacteria.How to use: Apply a small amount to the pimple as directed on the product label. Avoid overuse, as these ingredients can irritate skin if applied too heavily.Tips to reduce pimples fasterAvoid touching your face: Your hands carry bacteria that can worsen pimples.Keep skin clean: Gently cleanse your face twice daily with a mild cleanser.Use non-comedogenic products: Choose skincare and makeup products that won’t clog pores.Stay hydrated: Drinking water helps flush out toxins and supports skin healing.Get enough sleep: Rest allows your body to repair and rejuvenate skin overnight.Pimples form when excess oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria clog pores. The sooner you treat them, the faster you can reduce swelling and prevent further inflammation. Overnight treatments work by soothing the skin, targeting bacteria, and drying out excess oil, all of which help the pimple heal faster.While no remedy can completely erase pimples overnight, combining these treatments with consistent skincare habits can significantly reduce their appearance. If breakouts persist or worsen, it’s always best to consult a dermatologist for tailored advice. By following these tips, you can wake up to calmer, less inflamed skin and keep your complexion healthy and glowing.Also read| 5 common mistakes older women make that worsen hair lossAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

She cut out dairy and ate high-fiber foods. She also did facial exercises. These changes helped her get a more sculpted look. Eliminating dairy reduces bloating. Fiber-rich foods aid weight management. Chewing hard foods tones facial muscles. Detox juices and hydration are important. Regular facial exercises improve muscle tone.  Waking up to a puffy face or noticing extra roundness in your cheeks can be frustrating, especially when you want a more sculpted, defined look. While genetics and overall body weight play a role in facial fat, lifestyle choices such as diet, hydration, and targeted exercises can make a significant difference. In her July 30 Instagram post, Anushka Vyas shared the diet and exercise routine that helped her achieve a slimmer, more sculpted face. Her approach focused on cutting out dairy, eating high-fiber foods, and practicing facial exercises to tone muscles. By making these manageable changes, she achieved noticeable results, proving that natural methods can work wonders when followed consistently.Many people tend to overlook the fact that reducing facial fat requires a holistic approach rather than relying on spot reduction alone. While some quick fixes might temporarily reduce puffiness, sustainable results come from combining the right nutrition, hydration, and muscle-toning exercises.Simple diet and exercise tips to slim your faceEliminate dairy from your dietAnushka’s most impactful dietary change was cutting out dairy completely. Dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt can sometimes lead to water retention and bloating, making the face appear puffier than it actually is. By eliminating dairy, she noticed a significant reduction in facial bloating within a few weeks.Tip: Replace dairy with plant-based alternatives like almond milk, soy milk, or oat milk.Why it works: Less water retention means a naturally leaner, more contoured look.Include high-fiber foodsFiber-rich foods are essential for overall weight management, which also helps reduce facial fat. Anushka emphasizes the importance of including foods like spinach, kale, beetroot, berries, and apples. These help you feel fuller for longer, preventing overeating and unnecessary snacking.Tip: Add leafy greens to every meal and snack on fruits like apples or berries throughout the day.Benefit: High-fiber foods support digestion and help flush out toxins, indirectly contributing to a slimmer facial appearance.Eat hard-to-chew foodsOne of Anushka’s secrets is foods that require more chewing, which helps tone the jaw and cheek muscles over time. By engaging facial muscles regularly, these foods stimulate muscle tone and improve definition, giving your face a naturally sculpted look without invasive procedures.Tip: Include crunchy, fiber-rich foods like raw vegetables, nuts, and corn in your diet to engage facial muscles regularly. Benefit: This stimulates muscle tone and improves definition, giving your face a naturally sculpted look without any invasive procedures.Stay hydrated with detox juicesHydration plays a vital role in reducing puffiness and supporting overall health. Anushka suggests detox juices to flush out toxins and prevent water retention.Detox juice recipe:One slice of petha (winter squash)1 tsp turmeric (haldi)Juice of half a cucumberOne twig of meetha neem (curry leaves)Drinking this combination regularly can aid digestion, reduce bloating, and promote a slimmer facial appearance.Practice facial exercisesWhile spot reduction isn’t possible, certain facial exercises help tone muscles, improving overall definition. Anushka includes exercises that target the jawline, cheeks, and neck. Regular facial exercises improve blood circulation, tighten skin, and prevent sagging, giving your face a naturally toned and youthful look.Tip: Practice these exercises for 10–15 minutes daily to see noticeable results. Benefit: Regular practice strengthens and sculpts facial muscles, enhancing your natural facial contours over time.Other lifestyle tips to reduce face fatBeyond diet and exercises, several habits can further help reduce facial fat:Limit salt intake: Excess salt causes water retention and puffiness.Avoid processed sugar: High sugar consumption contributes to fat accumulation and inflammation.Sleep well: Adequate sleep reduces stress and cortisol, which can cause facial bloating.Stay active: Overall body fat reduction through cardio or strength training reflects on your face too.Combining these habits with Anushka’s routine ensures faster and sustainable results.Reducing face fat naturally is entirely achievable with the right combination of diet, hydration, and facial exercises. As Anushka Vyas demonstrated in her July 30 Instagram post, cutting out dairy, eating fiber-rich and hard-to-chew foods, staying hydrated with detox juices, and practicing targeted facial exercises can dramatically improve facial appearance.Consistency is key. While changes won’t happen overnight, following this routine regularly can help you achieve a slimmer, more sculpted face safely and naturally. Always remember to consult a healthcare professional before making significant changes to your diet or exercise routine, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions. By incorporating these tips, you can not only reduce face fat but also improve your overall health, confidence, and well-being.Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

During the 1965 and 1971 Indo-Pak wars, the temple miraculously survived bombings, with unexploded bombs now displayed as testaments to divine protection. Maintained by the BSF, the temple is a revered site for soldiers.  ‘Sandese aate hain, hume tadpate hain’, it’s not just a song but the emotions of many! These lyrics are the emotions of every member of a family whose sons and daughters are serving their nations, standing on borders and guarding their homelands with their lives. Parts of the song, from the blockbuster movie ‘Border’ were extensively shot near the 1971 Battle of Longewala ground, near Jaisalmer which is also home to the revered Tanot Mata Temple.Tanot Mata is not an ordinary temple. This Hindu temple in Jaisalmer district, Rajasthan, is located near the border with Pakistan. It is where the Longewala war happened during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 where India came out victorious.Live bombs from the war, the storyThe temple is unique in many senses as it houses live bombs from the war. During the Indo-Pak war in 1965, the temple was attacked by over 3,000 bombs. But as per local lore, these bombs some missed their target and some did not explode. Soon after, India's Border Security Force (BSF) took charge of the maintenance of the temple and nearby region.Later, in 1971, Tanot was again attacked during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 (Battle of Longewala). The border was attacked by tanks but they could not get in and went down in the sand. After winning the war, a Vijay Stambha or a Victory tower was built inside the temple. The bombs that did not explode were placed inside the temple. These heavy looking bombs are now put on display on shelves inside the temple covered by glass doors. The tanks are placed close to the temple near the border. There’s also a cute cafe called ‘Border’ cafe and a theater room where only ‘Border’ (the movie) plays.Soldiers praying groundThis is an important temple for soldiers who regularly pray here. They have immense faith in the deity and believe that the goddess protects them from any harm. It is quite an emotional scene looking at these strong soldiers breaking down in front of the goddess's statue to seek her blessings.Who was Tanot MataAs per history books, the temple was built by the Bhati Rajput King Tanu Rao in 828 AD. And since then, the temple became popular among people of Jaisalmer. As per the Charan records, the deity here is the incarnation of Hinglaj Mata and who later reincarnated as the Karni Mata.Legend has it that a man named Mamadji Charan has no kids. He decided to visit Hinglaj Mata on foot seven times to get a child. Then Hinglaj Mata asked him whether he wanted a son or a daughter, the man asked the goddess herself to take birth at his house in the form of their own kid. Soon after, the man was blessed with seven daughters and one son and one among them was Aavad Mata, also known as Tanot Mata.Victory Memorial and the war museumThere is a Victory Memorial and a war museum housing the unexploded Pakistani bombs and tanks. On 16th December every year, the victory of India is celebrated at the temple. Today, the temple along with the war memorial museum are a part of Bharat Ranbhoomi Darshan initiative of the Indian Military. It was done to boost border tourism.How to reachBy Train: Tanot Mata temple is only 120 km from Jaisalmer city. The Jaisalmer Railway station is the nearest to the temple. Visitors can hire local cabs or taxis to reach here. It takes around two hours to reach.By Air: The closest airport to Tanot Mata is in Jodhpur. From here, you can book cab rentals that take some four hours to reach the city.Best time to visitThe best time to explore this temple is between November and January. The weather remains rosy and pleasant during this time. Because the temperature is comfortable, it is easier to explore the temple and nearby regions.So next time you plan a trip to Jaisalmer, make sure you visit Tanot Mata temple.About the AuthorPriya SrivastavaComing from the ‘City of Nawabs’, Lucknow, Priya’s sole motto is to explore life through journeys to unexplored destinations and knitting travel stories.

The two have been spotted together a little too often lately, especially since their respective breakups, and fans have questions.

Oh, and Sydney? She posted a Story that featured MGK and Patrick Schwarzenegger too. Coincidence? We think not.mgk and Sydney Sweeney reunite at the opening of the Palm Tree Beach Club in Las Vegas on May 3, 2025.

A fan named Kyle P asked the question on all of our minds: “Is there any truth to the rumour that you and Sydney Sweeney are more than just friends?”

Not laughing they are investigating.Sources say MGK’s response was dripping in deflection. “He laughed it off, but didn’t exactly deny the closeness,” one fan posted. Another noted: “The way he avoided the question? Classic situationship energy.”

She starred in his 2021 directorial debut Downfalls High and appeared alongside him and Pete Davidson in Big Time Adolescence back in 2019. So yes, they have history, but is it friendly or flirty? Both are now single. MGK officially split from Megan Fox in December 2024 and recently welcomed baby Saga (yes, that is the name) with her.

The stars have aligned, literally.Alien dads, frank sinatra, and more chaosAs if that was not enough weirdness, MGK veered into sci-fi territory during the same interview. When asked about age, he said he was unsure if it “exists” and hinted at possibly having alien origins. Allegedly, he once asked his mum if she had ever disappeared mysteriously, and she admitted to an abduction. Yup, that happened.Also, his dream musical collab? Frank Sinatra. MGK said he “likes Frank” and would love to collab.

Effective home remedies to get rid of ‘tiddas’ or grasshoppers from your home and garden
Grasshoppers, often mistaken for locusts, can enter homes seeking food, drawn by bright lights and lush plants. Unlike locusts, they're solitary and less destructive. Effective control involves removing attractants, using natural repellents like garlic or neem oil sprays, and blocking entry points with screens. Early action and avoiding harsh chemicals are crucial for managing these pests.

Unlike locusts, they're solitary and less destructive. Effective control involves removing attractants, using natural repellents like garlic or neem oil sprays, and blocking entry points with screens. Early action and avoiding harsh chemicals are crucial for managing these pests.  Grasshoppers, also known as tiddas in Hindi, are common garden insects that sometimes make their way into homes. While usually harmless when alone, they can nibble on your plants and cause frustration if not controlled. Their resemblance to locusts often confuses gardeners, but the two behave very differently. Grasshoppers tend to stay in small numbers, hopping around quietly, whereas locusts appear in large swarms and can devastate crops in no time. Knowing the difference and using natural, home-based remedies can help you keep your garden and living spaces free from these pests without resorting to harsh chemicals.Why do grasshoppers come inside homesGrasshoppers generally enter homes and gardens in search of food, particularly green and leafy plants. Environmental factors also influence their movement. High temperatures, dry conditions, or bright lights on porches and inside homes can attract them, especially at night. Unlike locusts, which move in large groups, grasshoppers are usually solitary and prefer to hop around quietly in search of suitable vegetation. By recognising the conditions that draw them indoors, you can take preventive measures to minimise their intrusion.How to distinguish between grasshoppers and locustsGrasshoppers and locusts look quite similar at first glance. Both have long legs and strong jumping abilities and can fly. The key difference lies in their behaviour and numbers. Grasshoppers tend to be solitary or appear in small groups. Locusts, however, form large swarms and can rapidly consume crops and garden plants. Observing whether insects are alone or in groups helps determine the appropriate control method and prevents unnecessary alarm.Tips to get rid of grasshoppers at home and in the gardenManaging grasshoppers effectively involves a combination of prevention, natural repellents, and physical barriers. The following strategies can help:Remove what attracts themOvergrown plants, clusters of pots near windows or doors, and garden lights at night can draw grasshoppers inside. Regularly trimming vegetation and repositioning pots away from entry points can significantly reduce their presence. Switching off garden lights when not needed can also discourage them from approaching homes.Use natural spraysHome-made sprays can act as effective repellents. Mixing water with garlic or neem oil and applying it to plants helps deter grasshoppers. Additionally, planting herbs like basil or flowers such as marigolds around gardens can naturally repel these insects, as they dislike strong smells.Block entry pointsInstalling mesh screens on windows and doors prevents grasshoppers from entering living spaces. If an insect does manage to get inside, gently guiding it out with a broom or catching it in a jar and releasing it outdoors is the safest method. These non-chemical approaches protect both household members and pets from exposure to harmful substances.Common mistakes to avoid while removing grasshoppersMany people make the mistake of using harsh chemical sprays inside the house when trying to get rid of outdoor insects. Such chemicals can be harmful to both humans and pets. Instead, it is better to focus on controlling the outdoor environment where grasshoppers originate.Prompt action is crucial. Waiting until insects are already inside can mean they have caused damage to plants or household areas. Preventive measures such as turning off outdoor lights at night and maintaining a tidy garden will significantly reduce the likelihood of infestation. Acting early and consistently is key to keeping grasshoppers away.Grasshoppers or tiddas can be more than just a minor nuisance if they find their way into your garden or home. By understanding their behaviour, identifying them correctly, and taking preventive steps, you can protect your plants and living spaces. Focus on outdoor maintenance, use safe home sprays, and block entry points to effectively manage these insects. With careful attention and early action, grasshoppers can be kept under control without resorting to harmful chemicals.Also Read: 7 plants that take care of your mental health naturallyAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Harvard expert reveals jobs that may protect you from Alzheimer’s disease
A Harvard study reveals that taxi and ambulance drivers have lower Alzheimer's-related death rates, potentially due to the constant mental navigation required in their jobs. This active navigation may strengthen the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for memory. Engaging in activities that demand spatial reasoning could offer similar brain benefits, though further research is needed.

This active navigation may strengthen the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for memory. Engaging in activities that demand spatial reasoning could offer similar brain benefits, though further research is needed.  A Harvard Health Publishing report highlights a surprising link between certain occupations and a lower risk of dying from Alzheimer’s disease (AD). According to research reviewed by Dr. Robert H. Shmerling, taxi and ambulance drivers show markedly lower rates of AD-related deaths compared with many other professions. Scientists believe the mental demands of real-time navigation in these jobs may strengthen the hippocampus, a brain region critical for memory and spatial awareness, and one of the first areas affected by Alzheimer’s. If confirmed, these findings could open new doors in understanding and preventing the disease.Ambulance and taxi driver jobs may protect against Alzheimer’sEarlier studies on London taxi drivers revealed enlargement in specific areas of the hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for spatial memory. This region is particularly vulnerable to the damage caused by Alzheimer’s. Researchers suspect that the constant mental mapping, route planning, and decision-making involved in taxi and ambulance driving help preserve hippocampal health. These jobs often require drivers to process incoming information instantly, adapt to changing traffic patterns, and find the most efficient routes in unfamiliar areas. Over time, this mental workout may strengthen neural connections in the brain, potentially slowing or preventing the deterioration associated with Alzheimer’s disease.What the new study foundThe study examined data from nearly nine million death certificates, focusing on 443 occupations. After adjusting for the average age of death, the researchers discovered striking differences in Alzheimer’s-related mortality rates. Alzheimer’s accounted for just 0.91 percent of deaths among taxi drivers and 1.03 percent among ambulance drivers. This was more than 40 percent lower than the general population average and significantly lower than the 1.82 percent observed among chief executives. Pilots and ship captains had some of the highest rates, with 2.34 percent and 2.12 percent respectively. The findings suggest that the level of active navigation required in a job could be an important factor, although the benefit was not observed for other types of dementia.Why other navigation jobs are not equally protectiveWhile jobs like piloting an aircraft, captaining a ship, or driving a bus might seem similar in navigational demands, researchers explain that these roles often follow fixed routes or rely heavily on automated systems. Pilots can depend on autopilot and air traffic control, ship captains may navigate pre-determined sea routes, and bus drivers typically repeat the same path daily. As a result, the cognitive challenge is less intense and less varied compared to taxi and ambulance drivers, who must constantly adapt to new road conditions, passenger destinations, and emergency scenarios. This constant need for flexible problem-solving may be key to the observed brain benefits.Could everyday activities have the same effect?Experts believe it may be possible to gain similar brain benefits outside of professional driving. Activities that demand spatial reasoning and complex navigation skills could potentially help maintain hippocampal function. Examples include orienteering, geocaching, and hiking in unfamiliar terrain using a map and compass. Even indoor activities such as jigsaw puzzles, solving Rubik’s Cubes, or playing spatially challenging video games like Tetris and Minecraft might provide cognitive stimulation. However, researchers caution that there is still no definitive proof that such activities reduce Alzheimer’s risk in the same way these occupations appear to. Further studies will be needed to confirm whether these recreational tasks have long-term protective effects.The takeawayWhile this research does not conclusively prove that driving a taxi or ambulance prevents Alzheimer’s disease, it adds weight to the theory that mentally challenging and spatially demanding activities can help protect brain health. Harvard experts recommend that people interested in lowering their Alzheimer’s risk should combine mentally stimulating activities with other proven lifestyle measures. These include maintaining regular physical activity, eating a nutrient-rich diet, managing cardiovascular health, staying socially connected, and ensuring good sleep quality. Together, these strategies offer the best chance of reducing the likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia.About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

The story of 29-year-old Monika Choudhary, diagnosed with stage 4 colorectal cancer, challenges this perception. Despite adhering to a disciplined, nutrient-rich diet, Monika’s experience reveals how chronic stress, burnout, and inactivity can silently undermine even the healthiest lifestyle. Her journey underscores that holistic health involves more than nutrition—it demands balance between mental wellness, physical activity, and self-care.Perfect diet, hidden dangers: How stress and inactivity fuel serious health risksMonika had long maintained what many consider the ideal lifestyle. Her meals were clean, balanced, and free from fried or processed foods, reflecting widely recommended health principles. Friends and colleagues often praised her dedication to eating well, believing it was a foolproof way to maintain vitality. Yet, in July 2025, Monika received a diagnosis that would shatter this assumption: stage 4 colorectal cancer.Her story demonstrates a crucial point: a perfect diet alone cannot shield the body from the cumulative effects of chronic stress and inactivity. Even when nutrition is optimal, lifestyle factors like long work hours, prolonged sitting, and mental strain can create conditions that compromise overall health.Stage 4 cancer warning signs: Slow health decline from stress and little activityMonika’s health decline was gradual. At first, it was easy to ignore: slight fatigue after work, mild physical discomfort, and an uneasy feeling that something was off. However, over time, the warning signs became more persistent:Loss of physical routine: Once an avid runner, Monika had abandoned her evening runs, which previously served as both therapy and stress relief.Extended periods of inactivity: Days were largely spent indoors, seated at her desk or in front of screens, with minimal movement.Chronic mental fatigue: The relentless pressure of managing her own website led to ongoing exhaustion, often dismissed as normal work-related stress.These seemingly small shifts in routine had a cumulative effect on her body, silently setting the stage for serious health consequences.How stress, inactivity, and ignored symptoms lead to cancerStress and inactivity affect the body in profound, often invisible ways. Chronic mental stress triggers hormonal imbalances, which can increase inflammation and weaken the immune system. Physical inactivity further compounds these issues by reducing circulation, slowing metabolism, and impairing detoxification processes. Together, these factors create an environment in which diseases, including cancer, can develop and progress more aggressively. Monika herself reflected on the months leading up to her diagnosis: “Looking back, I realize it wasn’t just bad luck. It was the cumulative effect of ignoring my body, letting stress dominate my life, and becoming sedentary.”The reality hit hard when Monika received the stage 4 colorectal cancer diagnosis. Despite years of disciplined eating and avoiding unhealthy foods, her body had reached a critical point. Her experience highlights a vital truth: no diet, no matter how perfect, can fully counteract the hidden toll of chronic stress and physical inactivity.Monika’s diagnosis also underscores how early warning signs are often overlooked. Persistent fatigue, unease, and minor physical discomfort may feel inconsequential, but they are signals that the body is struggling. Ignoring these signs can allow underlying conditions to progress unnoticed until they become life-threatening.How lifestyle factors like stress and inactivity causes cancer riskChronic stress and hormonal imbalanceProlonged stress triggers the release of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can weaken the immune system over time. A suppressed immune system struggles to detect and destroy abnormal cells, increasing the risk of cancer development.Physical inactivity and poor circulationSedentary lifestyles reduce blood circulation and lymphatic flow, slowing the removal of toxins and impairing nutrient delivery to cells. This creates an environment where abnormal cell growth can thrive.Ignoring early warning signsPersistent fatigue, discomfort, and unexplained unease are often dismissed as normal stress or busy schedules. Ignoring these subtle signals allows underlying conditions to progress unchecked, potentially escalating to serious illnesses, including cancer.Cumulative lifestyle impactEven with a healthy diet, long-term burnout, screen overuse, and lack of exercise can accumulate damage at the cellular level. Oxidative stress and inflammation caused by these factors further increase cancer risk.Prevention tips: How to reduce cancer risk from stress, inactivity, and ignored symptomsManage stress proactivelyIncorporate mindfulness practices, meditation, and regular breaks into your daily routine. Reducing stress helps regulate hormone levels and supports immune function.Stay physically activeAim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily, including walking, jogging, or yoga. Physical activity improves circulation, boosts immunity, and reduces cancer risk.Listen to your bodyTake note of persistent fatigue, discomfort, or other unusual symptoms. Early detection of changes can significantly improve outcomes.Maintain a balanced lifestyleCombine a nutrient-rich diet with sufficient sleep, hydration, and social support. Balance between mental, physical, and emotional health is key for long-term wellness.Schedule regular medical check-upsRoutine screenings, lab tests, and consultations help detect potential issues before they escalate, increasing the chances of early intervention.Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

However, excessive consumption may lead to digestive issues like bloating and gas. It can also affect blood pressure and blood sugar levels, especially for those with pre-existing conditions. Allergic reactions, though rare, are possible. Moderation and awareness of individual health are crucial for safe enjoyment.  Dragon fruit, also known as pitaya or kamalam, has quickly become a favourite for health-conscious people thanks to its striking look and powerful nutrients. Packed with vitamin C, fiber, antioxidants, protein, iron, and magnesium, it supports immunity, aids digestion, and helps keep your skin glowing. Native to Southeast Asia and South America, its sweet-tangy flavour is often compared to a mix of kiwi and pear. While this tropical superfood can boost your health, eating too much or ignoring precautions may cause side effects such as digestive discomfort, allergies, blood sugar changes, or interactions with certain medications.Before you eat dragon fruit, know these 7 side effectsDigestive IssuesDragon fruit contains a significant amount of dietary fiber, which is beneficial for maintaining healthy digestion. According to a study published in NIH, consuming too much fiber at once can have the opposite effect, leading to bloating, gas, stomach pain, diarrhea, or indigestion. Individuals with pre-existing digestive conditions should consume dragon fruit in moderation to avoid discomfort. Starting with small portions and gradually increasing intake can help your digestive system adjust to the fiber content.Effects on blood pressureDragon fruit may have a mild blood pressure-lowering effect, which can be advantageous for people with hypertension. On the other hand, those with naturally low blood pressure should exercise caution. Excessive consumption could cause dizziness, fatigue, or weakness. If you already have low blood pressure, it is advisable to limit dragon fruit intake and monitor your symptoms.Risk of weight gainAlthough dragon fruit is low in calories compared to many desserts or snacks, it still contains natural sugars. Eating it in large quantities can contribute to an increased calorie intake, potentially leading to weight gain. This is particularly relevant for people with diabetes or those trying to manage their weight. Moderation is key, and pairing dragon fruit with protein or fiber-rich foods can help maintain balanced blood sugar levels.Allergic reactionsWhile uncommon, some individuals may be allergic to dragon fruit. According to a study published on ResearchGate, allergic responses can range from mild to severe, including itching, skin rashes, swelling of the face or lips, difficulty breathing, and in rare cases, anaphylaxis. People with a history of fruit allergies should consult a healthcare professional before introducing dragon fruit into their diet.Blood sugar considerationsDragon fruit contains natural sugars that can affect blood sugar levels. For people with diabetes or those monitoring their glucose, consuming it in large amounts may lead to sudden spikes. It is important to eat dragon fruit in moderation and consult a doctor or dietitian to determine safe portion sizes. Pairing the fruit with protein or healthy fats can help stabilise blood sugar and reduce the risk of rapid increases. Being mindful of portion size and balancing it with other foods ensures you can enjoy dragon fruit safely without adversely affecting your blood sugar.Interactions with medicationsDragon fruit may interact with certain medications, particularly those used to manage blood pressure, blood sugar, or allergies. Consuming the fruit while on these medications could enhance or reduce their effectiveness. It is best to consult a healthcare provider before adding dragon fruit to your diet if you take prescription medications.Changes in urine or stool colourEating the red variety of dragon fruit may temporarily change the colour of your urine or stool to pink or red. Although harmless, this can be alarming if unexpected. Excessive consumption may also lead to imbalances in certain nutrients over time, as the fruit is rich in specific vitamins and minerals that, in high quantities, can disrupt nutrient balance.Tips for safe consumption of Dragon Fruit To enjoy dragon fruit safely and maximize its benefits, follow these guidelines:Wash the fruit thoroughly before consumption to remove any contaminants.Cut the fruit in half and scoop out the pulp with a spoon.Dice it for use in fruit salads, smoothies, or yogurt for added nutrition.The seeds are edible and can be eaten along with the flesh.Consume in moderation, particularly if you have digestive issues, low blood pressure, or diabetes.Dragon fruit is a nutritious and versatile fruit, but like any food, it should be consumed mindfully. By understanding its potential side effects and following safe consumption practices, you can enjoy its health benefits without compromising your well-being. Moderation, balanced diet, and awareness of personal health conditions are key to making the most of this tropical superfood.Also Read: Celebrate Krishna Janmashtami with these 7 sacred bhog offering recipesAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Several factors contribute to this issue. Harsh hair products, tight hairstyles, and rough handling worsen the problem. Poor nutrition and unmanaged stress also play a role. Women can slow hair loss by making simple changes. Choosing gentle products and avoiding tight styles help.  Hair loss is a common concern for many older women, often caused by a mix of genetic, hormonal, and lifestyle factors. While some changes are inevitable with age, certain habits can accelerate thinning and make hair more fragile. These mistakes range from harsh haircare routines and poor nutrition to unmanaged stress. By recognising and addressing these avoidable triggers, women can help slow the rate of hair loss and maintain stronger, fuller strands. Understanding what damages hair and making small adjustments in daily care can have a significant impact on preserving hair health and boosting confidence over time.5 reasons why women over 50 experience faster hair lossUsing harmful haircare products without checking labelsWith endless haircare products on the market, choosing the right ones can be overwhelming. Many shampoos, conditioners, and styling products contain harsh chemicals that may weaken hair or accelerate shedding. Ingredients such as formaldehyde, sodium lauryl sulfate, propylene glycol, glycol distearate, and sodium chloride can strip moisture, irritate the scalp, and damage follicles. Even products marketed as “strengthening” or “repairing” can be misleading.For example, keratin, a protein naturally found in hair, is often added to treatments to create shine. However, when combined with heat styling, it can actually cause brittleness and breakage, especially if the formula contains formaldehyde. Selecting hair products requires considering your hair type, porosity, and styling habits, but avoiding harmful chemicals is a good starting point. Reading ingredient labels carefully is one of the simplest yet most effective ways to protect your hair as you age.Wearing tight hairstyles that strain hair folliclesTraction alopecia is a common but preventable cause of hair loss, especially in women who regularly wear tight hairstyles. According to JAMA Dermatology, styles such as tightly braided hair, slick buns, ponytails, and heavy extensions pull on the roots, causing stress that can lead to follicle damage over time. Longer, heavier hair can also place added tension on the scalp, increasing the risk of breakage. While wearing a snug hairstyle occasionally is unlikely to cause major harm, making it a daily habit can gradually thin the hairline and weaken growth. It’s also important to avoid tying hair tightly when it’s wet, as damp strands are more elastic and prone to damage. Opting for loose, comfortable styles and using soft hair ties can help reduce unnecessary strain.Over-Brushing, rough handling, and excessive heat stylingHair care habits can make a huge difference in the health of your hair. Brushing too often or too aggressively can stretch and weaken strands, damage the scalp, and stress the follicles. The old advice of brushing hair “100 strokes a day” is outdated and can actually cause harm, especially to already thinning hair. Wet hair is particularly fragile, so detangling should always be done gently with a wide-tooth comb and minimal pulling. Rough towel drying, heavy use of hairspray, and sleeping on hair without protection can also lead to breakage. Heat styling is another major culprit; blow dryers, curling irons, and flat irons can cause dryness, split ends, and brittleness. While heat tools don’t make hair fall out at the root, they can shorten the lifespan of each strand, making thinning more noticeable. Using a heat protectant, lowering temperature settings, and limiting heat use are essential for maintaining hair health.Ignoring nutrition and key vitamins for hair healthDiet plays a critical role in the strength and growth of hair. Even if hair loss is caused by other factors, nutritional deficiencies can worsen the problem. According to a study published in NIH, hair growth depends on key nutrients such as biotin and vitamins A, C, D, and E, as well as protein, omega-3 fatty acids, zinc, iron, and magnesium. Low levels of these nutrients can lead to dull, brittle, or thinning hair. As people age, appetite changes, digestive issues, or restrictive diets may make it harder to meet nutritional needs. A balanced, mostly plant-based diet rich in whole foods, leafy greens, nuts, seeds, legumes, and healthy fats can support healthy hair growth. Supplements can be helpful when deficiencies are present, but they should be taken under professional guidance to ensure safety and effectiveness.Underestimating the impact of stressChronic stress affects nearly every aspect of health, and hair is no exception. Prolonged stress can disrupt the hair growth cycle, leading to excessive shedding or slower regrowth. This is often seen in conditions like telogen effluvium, where stress pushes hair follicles into a resting phase, causing sudden thinning. While it’s impossible to avoid all stress, managing it effectively can protect your overall well-being and your hair.Activities such as daily exercise, meditation, yoga, prayer, deep breathing exercises, or even hobbies that promote relaxation can help lower stress levels. Some people find stress relief in less conventional methods, like face massages or “floor time,” where you simply lie down and decompress. The key is consistency; making stress management a regular habit can benefit both your mind and your hair.While aging naturally changes the texture and volume of hair, many women unknowingly speed up hair loss through avoidable habits. By choosing gentle, chemical-free hair products, avoiding tight hairstyles, handling hair with care, prioritizing good nutrition, and managing stress, it’s possible to maintain healthier, fuller hair for longer. Though not all causes of hair loss can be reversed, making these adjustments can greatly improve hair strength and help preserve what you have.Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

The production of melatonin hormone which helps control sleep patterns and fights cancer, becomes disrupted when people experience sleep problems. Research shows that inadequate sleep duration or poor sleep quality, increases the likelihood of developing several types of cancer.  Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the world. While genes and environment do play a role in Cancer diagnosis, there are other hidden factors that can lead to Cancer, even if you are otherwise low risk. 29-year-old Monika Choudhary was textbook healthy, till Cancer brutally came as a jolt. In an IG post, the entrepreneur revealed how things changed, and she lost focus on her health at some point consumed by stress, that she believes eventually led to her Cancer diagnosis. (image is representational)Work pressure, deadlinesIn her post, Monika said, "I’ve always been a focused person, especially when it comes to my health. I used to eat healthy and take good care of my diet. I never liked fried or oily food. When I started working on my own website, I didn’t realise how demanding and all-consuming it would become. The long working hours, screen time, constant deadlines, and stress slowly started to take a toll on me — mentally and physically.Cancer is curable if detected early: Signs to pay attention toMy days became sedentary. I wasn’t moving much, I barely stepped outside, and I completely lost touch with my physical routine."Huge shiftShe added, "This was a huge shift from the lifestyle I had before — I used to be extremely active. Evening runs were a part of my everyday routine. They were my escape, my therapy. As I got more immersed in work, I kept pushing my health to the side. I told myself I’d get back to it “soon” — but that “soon” never came."PollWhich factor do you believe poses the greatest risk for developing cancer?Chronic stress and overworkingPoor sleep and lifestyle habitsBody started giving signsMonika added that soon her body started giving signs. She said, "Slowly, my body started giving signs — fatigue, uneasiness, discomfort — but I dismissed them, blaming it all on work pressure or a lack of sleep."The rude joltMonika's life turned around when she was diagnosed with cancer. In her own words, "Then came the diagnosis: Stage-4 colorectal cancer. A shocking moment that changed everything. Looking back now, I realise this wasn’t just about bad luck. It was a result of stress, burnout, and complete physical neglect over time. I learned, in the hardest way possible, that no ambition is worth compromising your health. Our body always keeps the score — and it eventually demands attention, one way or another."How poor lifestyle conditions lead to CancerEven though no single risk factor leads to cancer, but stress, overworking, and lack of sleep affect the immune system and increases inflammation, and impairs hormone regulation. Let's see how...StressChronic stress produces effects beyond anxiety and overwhelming feelings. Prolonged stress exposure, leads the body to produce cortisol and adrenaline (stress hormones). The immune system struggles to detect abnormal cells, while chronic inflammation occurs as a result. The release of stress hormones results in DNA destruction, alongside disruptions to essential proteins, which combat cancer cell development. Chronic stress acts as an environment for cancer cells to proliferate, while facilitating their spread throughout the body.OverworkingPeople who work excessively, along with insufficient rest periods face an elevated danger of cancer development. The connection between extensive work hours and unhealthy behaviors, leads to poor diet choices and diminished exercise levels, along with elevated smoking and drinking habits which are established cancer risk factors. Scientific research indicates that work-related stress, and long working hours possibly lead to higher breast, lung and colorectal cancer rates, though this can vary.Insufficient sleepThe body requires sleep to heal itself, and protect its immune system from damage. The production of melatonin hormone which helps control sleep patterns and fights cancer, becomes disrupted when people experience sleep problems. Research shows that inadequate sleep duration or poor sleep quality, increases the likelihood of developing several types of cancer. The lack of sleep causes damaged DNA alongside weakened immunity, increased inflammation and disrupted circadian rhythms, which all work together to help cancer cells develop.SourcesInterplay between stress and cancer—A focus on inflammation - PMCWork stress and the risk of cancer: A meta-analysisLack of Sleep Linked to Increased Risk of Cancer - Cancer Therapy AdvisorChronic Stress Promotes Cancer Development - PMCLong working hours and cancer risk: a multi-cohort study - PMCSleep quality and risk of cancer: findings from the English cohort - PMCDoes Sleep Affect Cancer Risk? | American Cancer SocietyCancer and Sleep - Sleep FoundationStress and Cancer - NCIThe Link Between Stressful Jobs & Cancer | Early DetectionDisclaimer: This article is informational only and not a substitute for medical adviceAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Liver damage warning signs: Constant itching on hands and feet could be serious
Unexplained itching on hands and feet could signal liver issues. Doctors say, this itching, especially on palms and soles, might be due to bile acid buildup.

Doctors say, this itching, especially on palms and soles, might be due to bile acid buildup. Liver disorders like cholestasis or cirrhosis are often linked. Watch for night-time itching, fatigue, or jaundice. Consult a doctor if symptoms persist. Simple steps can help soothe the itch.  Itchy hands and feet are commonly mistaken for dry skin, allergies, or minor irritations. However, when the itching is persistent, unexplained, and occurs without a visible rash, it could signal an underlying liver problem. Medical experts highlight that such itching, especially when concentrated on the palms and soles, may result from a buildup of bile acids in the bloodstream due to impaired liver function. This condition is often associated with disorders like cholestasis or liver cirrhosis. If the itching worsens at night, doesn’t respond to moisturisers, or is accompanied by fatigue or jaundice, it’s essential to consult a doctor promptly.Why liver damage can cause itching on hands and feetWhen the liver is not functioning properly, bile acids and toxins can build up in the bloodstream. These substances may then irritate nerve endings under the skin, leading to an intense, persistent itch, especially on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.This condition is known as cholestatic pruritus, and it often occurs without a visible rash, making it harder to diagnose. It is commonly linked to liver disorders such as:Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)CirrhosisIntrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP)Unknown Myths About Liver Disease BustedCauses of itching in liver disease:Scientists have not yet pinpointed a single cause behind the itching (pruritus) associated with liver disease. According to Healthline, it is believed to result from a combination of factors, which may include:1. Bile saltsIn liver disease, bile salts can accumulate beneath the skin, potentially triggering itching. However, this link isn’t consistent, some individuals with high bile salt levels don’t experience itching, while others itch despite normal levels.2. HistaminesMany people with liver-related itching have elevated histamine levels, although antihistamines are often ineffective in providing relief.3. SerotoninSerotonin may influence how the brain perceives itching, though its exact role remains unclear.4. Pregnancy and hormone therapyItching can worsen during pregnancy or while undergoing hormone replacement therapy, likely due to hormonal fluctuations.5. Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP)Elevated ALP levels are frequently seen in individuals experiencing itch-related liver conditions, suggesting a possible connection.Key symptoms to watch forIt’s important to differentiate everyday skin irritation from liver-related itching. Below are signs that your itching may be a warning from your liver:Itching without a rashMost skin conditions cause itching accompanied by redness, bumps, or inflammation. In contrast, liver-related itching is intense yet rash-free, affecting deep layers under the skin.It worsens at nightLiver-related itching typically becomes more severe in the evening or during sleep. Night-time itching can severely affect your quality of life and disrupt rest.It starts on hands and feetItchiness often begins in the palms and soles before spreading. These areas are sensitive to bile salt accumulation, a hallmark of liver dysfunction.Associated liver symptomsOther signs of liver problems may include:FatigueYellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice)Dark urinePale stoolsUnexplained weight lossWhen to consult a doctorYou should seek medical advice if:Itching is persistent, unexplained, or resistant to moisturisersYou notice signs of jaundice or chronic fatigueThe itching is disrupting your sleep or daily lifeA healthcare provider may order liver function tests, including bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and ultrasound scans to investigate further.Tips to prevent itching and protect your skinAvoid scratching, even when the urge is strong, as it can break the skin and increase the risk of infection. If nighttime itching is a problem, consider wearing gloves to bed to prevent unconscious scratching.Here are additional ways to soothe itching and reduce skin irritation:Bathe or shower with warm or cool water, never hot.Limit time spent in hot environments or direct sunlight.Use mild, fragrance-free soaps to avoid further irritation.Apply gentle, unscented moisturisers regularly to keep skin hydrated.Use a cold, damp cloth on itchy areas to ease discomfort.Stay away from substances or materials that irritate your skin.Wear gloves when handling harsh cleaning products or chemicals.Opt for loose, breathable clothing to prevent chafing.Use a humidifier in dry weather, especially during winter.Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not substitute professional medical advice.

New study warns! Routine AI use may affect doctors’ tumor diagnostic skills by 20%
Artificial Intelligence is changing healthcare. It helps in early disease detection and treatment. A recent study shows doctors may lose skills if they depend too much on AI. When AI support was removed, doctors' tumor detection skills dropped. Experts suggest using AI as a support tool, not a replacement.

It helps in early disease detection and treatment. A recent study shows doctors may lose skills if they depend too much on AI. When AI support was removed, doctors' tumor detection skills dropped. Experts suggest using AI as a support tool, not a replacement. Regular training and critical thinking are important to maintain skills.   Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare, offering tools that improve early disease detection, diagnostic accuracy, and treatment planning. AI-assisted systems can help clinicians identify conditions such as pre-cancerous growths or subtle anomalies that might be missed otherwise, boosting patient outcomes and overall clinical efficiency. However, recent research highlights a potential downside: excessive reliance on AI may lead to skill erosion among healthcare professionals. Even experienced doctors who regularly use AI tools may find their independent decision-making and observational abilities decline over time. AI has the potential to transform medicine, improve patient outcomes, and streamline healthcare workflows. However, the recent study serves as a reminder that over-reliance on technology can erode critical skills, even among experienced doctors. A balanced approach—where AI supports rather than replaces human judgment—is essential for sustaining both high-quality patient care and professional expertise.Doctors’ ability to spot pre-cancerous growths declines when AI is removedA recent study in The Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology, investigated how AI impacts colonoscopy performance. The researchers found that AI assistance enabled doctors to detect pre-cancerous growths in the colon more effectively, potentially preventing progression to colorectal cancer.However, a concerning trend emerged: when AI support was removed, doctors’ ability to detect tumors dropped by approximately 20%, even compared with rates recorded before AI introduction. This suggests that clinicians may unconsciously rely on AI cues, reducing their independent observational skills.Global adoption of AI in healthcare systemsHealthcare systems worldwide are increasingly investing in AI technology. AI is being positioned as a tool to boost diagnostic accuracy, improve workflow efficiency, and enhance patient safety.For instance, in 2025, the British government announced £11 million (S$19 million) in funding for a trial exploring how AI can facilitate earlier breast cancer detection. While AI offers promising benefits, these developments highlight the importance of maintaining human expertise alongside technological advancements.Doctors losing skills due to AI dependence: Here’s what the study foundThe study revealed that AI can inadvertently encourage over-reliance, even among highly skilled clinicians. According to the research paper, AI support can result in doctors becoming less motivated, less focused, and less responsible when making decisions independently.The researchers studied four endoscopy centers in Poland, comparing colonoscopy detection rates three months before and after AI implementation. The procedures were randomized: some were performed with AI guidance, others without. The difference in detection rates highlighted the risk of skill erosion caused by dependency on AI tools.AI can reduce tumor detection skills in expert doctorsInterestingly, the study participants were 19 highly experienced doctors, each with over 2,000 colonoscopies completed. Despite their expertise, AI still affected their ability to detect tumors without assistance.Professor Yuichi Mori, one of the study authors from the University of Oslo, warned that skill degradation could worsen as AI becomes more sophisticated.Dr. Omer Ahmad, a gastroenterologist at University College Hospital London, added:“Although AI continues to offer great promise to enhance clinical outcomes, we must also safeguard against the quiet erosion of fundamental skills required for high-quality endoscopy.”He noted that the effect could be more pronounced for trainees or novice doctors, who might become overly dependent on AI before mastering essential diagnostic skills.Excessive AI use may reduce brain engagement and focus; study revealsConcerns about over-reliance on AI extend beyond healthcare. A 2025 MIT study found that students using OpenAI’s ChatGPT to write essays demonstrated less cognitive engagement and brain activity, illustrating how AI can unintentionally reduce critical thinking skills.These findings underscore the need for balanced AI integration—leveraging AI’s advantages while ensuring that human expertise and cognitive abilities remain intact.Strategies to maintain skills while using AITo mitigate skill erosion, healthcare professionals and institutions can adopt several strategies:AI as a support tool, not a replacement – Use AI to assist decisions while maintaining independent judgment.Regular performance monitoring – Track detection accuracy with and without AI to identify skill gaps.Structured training rotations – Alternate between AI-assisted and manual procedures to preserve proficiency.Active critical thinking – Encourage clinicians to question and evaluate AI suggestions rather than blindly following them.Continuous education – Reinforce fundamental diagnostic skills through workshops and refresher courses.By implementing these measures, healthcare systems can maximise AI’s benefits while safeguarding essential clinical competencies.Disclaimer: The information presented in this article is for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

This juice, packed with amla, beetroot, black grapes, and pomegranate, fights free radicals, boosts collagen, and enhances skin elasticity. Regular consumption, along with a balanced lifestyle, can slow visible signs of ageing and promote youthful skin.  Ever wish you could slow down ageing and maintain radiant, youthful skin? Nutritionist Anjali Mukerjee highlights that glowing skin isn’t just about creams or treatments—it starts with your diet. She recommends a simple, homemade juice packed with antioxidants, vitamins, and essential nutrients that help combat fine lines, dullness, and sagging. By nourishing your body from the inside, this juice supports skin regeneration, improves elasticity, and fights oxidative stress caused by free radicals. Regular consumption can enhance hydration, brighten complexion, and slow visible signs of ageing. Integrating such nutrient-rich beverages into your daily routine offers a natural, affordable, and effective approach to long-term skin health.How diet and antioxidants can slow visible signs of ageing with these powerful superfoodsAgeing is a natural process, but the speed at which your body shows signs of ageing—such as wrinkles, dark spots, and loss of skin elasticity—can be influenced by diet. Foods rich in antioxidants help combat oxidative stress and protect skin cells, potentially delaying visible signs of ageing.Nutritionist Anjali Mukerjee highlights that incorporating antioxidant-rich ingredients like amla (Indian gooseberry), pomegranate, and black grapes into your diet can strengthen the skin’s natural defense system and enhance collagen production, essential for firm, youthful skin.https://www.instagram.com/p/DNKcRRTxtEL/ Why amla, beetroot, and grapes are anti-aging powerhousesBeetroot: Boost circulation and detoxifyBeetroot is packed with vitamin C, iron, and nitrates, which improve blood circulation, enhance skin elasticity, and aid the body’s detoxification process. Improved blood flow ensures that nutrients reach skin cells efficiently, giving the skin an inner glow and youthful vitality.Amla: Collagen booster and free radical fighterAmla is a staple in traditional Indian health practices, revered for its high vitamin C content and potent antioxidant properties. It helps in collagen synthesis, reduces oxidative stress, and supports cellular repair. Together, these benefits slow down the appearance of fine lines, sagging, and pigmentation.Black grapes and pomegranate: Skin-protective nutrientsBlack grapes and pomegranate are rich in polyphenols and antioxidants, which work synergistically with amla and beetroot to neutralize free radicals, prevent cellular damage, and promote skin hydration and elasticity.Homemade anti-ageing juice recipeIngredients:1 small amla (Indian gooseberry)1 cup pomegranate seeds1 cup black grapesBlack salt and chat masala to tastePreparation steps:Grate the deseeded amla and strain it to extract juice.Juice the black grapes and pomegranate separately.Mix all the juices together.Add a pinch of black salt and chat masala for taste.Serve immediately for maximum freshness and potency.Pro tip: Consume this juice within 20 minutes of preparation to retain its antioxidant properties.How this juice fights skin ageingFree radicals are unstable molecules that can damage skin cells, accelerating ageing symptoms like fine lines, pigmentation, and sagging. They are produced naturally through metabolism, environmental exposure, and UV radiation.Antioxidants found in amla, beetroot, pomegranate, and black grapes neutralize free radicals, protect cellular structures, and nourish the skin from the inside out. Regular consumption, combined with a healthy diet, exercise, and proper sleep, can significantly slow down visible ageing while improving overall well-being.Additional tips for healthy, youthful skinStay hydrated: Drink plenty of water to maintain skin elasticity.Balanced diet: Include whole grains, nuts, seeds, and leafy greens for nutrients that support skin health.Regular exercise: Improves circulation, which boosts nutrient delivery to skin cells.Adequate sleep: Allows cellular repair and rejuvenation, essential for youthful skin.About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Tension, sinus, and cluster headaches each have unique characteristics and triggers. Seeking medical advice is crucial for severe or worsening headaches, enabling accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plans, alongside lifestyle adjustments, to effectively manage these conditions.  Headaches affect millions worldwide, but not all headaches are the same. Migraines are a unique neurological disorder, often confused with common headaches, leading to misdiagnosis and ineffective treatment. Unlike typical headaches, migraines cause intense, throbbing pain, often accompanied by symptoms like nausea, sensitivity to light and sound, and visual disturbances. Understanding the key differences between migraines and tension or cluster headaches is essential for accurate diagnosis and effective migraine treatment. Recognising migraine symptoms early can significantly improve quality of life and help manage this debilitating condition with proper medical care and lifestyle changes.How to differentiate migraine and headachesWhile migraines and common headaches both involve head pain, they differ significantly in their causes, symptoms, and severity. Decode Your Migraines: Understanding Common Triggers And SolutionsMigraines are a neurological condition characterised by intense, often throbbing pain on one side of the head, accompanied by symptoms like nausea, sensitivity to light and sound, and visual disturbances known as aura. In contrast, typical headaches such as tension headaches usually present as a milder, steady, band-like pressure around the head without these additional symptoms. What is a migraineMigraines are intense, recurring headaches accompanied by additional symptoms beyond just pain. They can last from 4 to 72 hours and are often debilitating.Common characteristics of migraines include:One-sided pain: Typically throbbing or pulsating, often on one side of the head.Aura: Visual disturbances such as flashing lights, zigzag lines, or blind spots that occur before the headache.Sensitivity: Increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), sound (phonophobia), and sometimes smells.Nausea and vomiting: Often accompany the headache phase.Other symptoms: Fatigue, dizziness, and difficulty concentrating.Common triggers include hormonal changes (e.g., menstruation), stress, certain foods and drinks (like caffeine or alcohol), dehydration, and changes in sleep patterns.What is a tension headacheTension headaches are the most common type of headache and are generally less severe than migraines.Key features:Pain description: A steady, dull, tightening or pressing sensation, often described as a "band" around the forehead or the back of the head and neck.Pain intensity: Mild to moderate.Duration: Lasts from 30 minutes to several hours, sometimes even days.Associated symptoms: Usually no nausea or vomiting; sensitivity to light or sound is rare.Triggers often include stress, poor posture, anxiety, fatigue, and muscle strain.Sinus headacheSinus headaches arise from inflammation or infection in the sinuses and often accompany sinusitis.Symptoms include:Pain and pressure: Felt around the forehead, cheeks, and eyes.Other symptoms: Nasal congestion, thick nasal discharge, fever, and fatigue.Sinus headaches are often mistaken for migraines but usually resolve with treatment of the underlying sinus infection.Cluster headacheCluster headaches are relatively rare but extremely painful headaches that occur in cyclical patterns or clusters.Characteristics include:Pain location: Severe, burning or piercing pain around one eye or temple.Duration: Usually last between 15 minutes and 3 hours.Frequency: Can occur multiple times a day during cluster periods.Associated symptoms: Red or watery eye, nasal congestion or runny nose on the affected side, drooping eyelid.Cluster headaches often occur in seasonal patterns and may be triggered by alcohol or strong smells.How to know when to see a doctorSeek medical advice if you experience:A sudden, severe headache unlike any before.Headaches that worsen or become more frequent.Headaches accompanied by neurological symptoms such as vision changes, weakness, difficulty speaking, or confusion.Headaches that interfere significantly with daily activities.Headaches following a head injury.Diagnosis and treatmentDiagnosis usually involves:A detailed medical history and description of symptoms.Physical and neurological examinations.Sometimes imaging tests like MRI or CT scans to rule out other causes.Treatment options vary depending on the headache typeMigraines: Pain relief with over-the-counter medications, triptans, anti-nausea drugs; preventive medications; lifestyle and dietary changes.Tension headaches: Painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen, stress reduction techniques, improved posture.Sinus headaches: Treating the underlying infection with decongestants, antihistamines, or antibiotics if necessary.Cluster headaches: Fast-acting treatments like oxygen therapy, triptans, and preventive medications prescribed by specialists.Lifestyle tips to manage headaches and migrainesMaintain a regular sleep schedule.Stay hydrated.Manage stress through relaxation techniques such as meditation or yoga.Avoid known triggers, such as specific foods or environmental factors.Engage in regular physical exercise.Keep a headache diary to identify patterns and triggers.Disclaimer: This article is intended for informational purposes only and does not replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

How gout increases your risk of developing type 2 diabetes: Know the link between the two
Gout and type 2 diabetes often coexist, exacerbating metabolic health issues through shared risk factors like obesity and poor diet. Insulin resistance links these conditions, impacting glucose metabolism and uric acid excretion. Managing both effectively requires lifestyle adjustments, including diet, exercise, hydration, and smart medication choices to mitigate long-term cardiovascular and kidney risks.

Insulin resistance links these conditions, impacting glucose metabolism and uric acid excretion. Managing both effectively requires lifestyle adjustments, including diet, exercise, hydration, and smart medication choices to mitigate long-term cardiovascular and kidney risks.  Gout and type 2 diabetes frequently occur together, creating a cycle that can significantly harm metabolic health. Gout results from the buildup of uric acid crystals in the joints, causing severe inflammation and pain. Type 2 diabetes is characterised by insulin resistance and elevated blood sugar levels. Both conditions share common risk factors, including excess body weight, diets high in sugar and processed foods, and a lack of physical activity. Understanding the connection between gout and diabetes is crucial for effective management, helping to prevent complications and improve overall health and quality of life.Understanding gout and diabetesGoutGout occurs when excess uric acid in the blood forms sharp crystals in the joints. This can trigger intense inflammation, causing severe pain and discomfort. Uric acid is a waste product generated from the breakdown of purines, substances found naturally in the body and certain foods. When the body produces too much uric acid or cannot eliminate it efficiently through the kidneys, levels build up, leading to gout. DiabetesDiabetes is a chronic condition that affects how your body processes blood sugar (glucose), which is a vital energy source. In type 2 diabetes, the most common form, the body becomes resistant to insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. Over time, this leads to elevated glucose in the blood, which can cause damage to organs, nerves, and blood vessels. The link between gout and type 2 diabetesExtensive studies show that individuals diagnosed with gout face a substantially higher likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes than those without. The persistent inflammation and elevated uric acid levels in gout contribute to metabolic disturbances that impair insulin sensitivity. Over time, chronic inflammation can interfere with glucose metabolism, making blood sugar control more difficult. This impact is particularly pronounced in women, who often show a stronger correlation between gout and future diabetes. By understanding this risk, healthcare providers can prioritise early monitoring and preventive strategies.How insulin resistance connects diabetes with goutA key link between gout and diabetes lies in insulin resistance. Uric acid appears to disrupt insulin signalling, reducing the body’s ability to use glucose effectively and paving the way for elevated blood sugar. Concurrently, insulin resistance impairs uric acid excretion by the kidneys, elevating uric acid levels and promoting gout attacks. Both conditions also involve overlapping genetic predispositions, genes that influence fat metabolism, inflammation, and the handling of uric acid and glucose often overlap, creating a biological bridge between the two disorders.When diabetes might lower your gout riskInterestingly, the relationship isn’t completely one-way. Certain forms of diabetes, particularly less-managed type 1 diabetes in men, seem to be linked with a lower incidence of gout. One theory suggests that high blood sugar levels may suppress inflammatory responses, thereby reducing the risk of gout flares. That said, this potential protective effect must be balanced against the long-term complications of poorly controlled diabetes, such as cardiovascular and kidney damage.Managing gout and diabetes effectivelyA unified strategy can help manage both gout and diabetes simultaneously, here’s how:1. Maintain a healthy weight and stay activeExcess body weight promotes both insulin resistance and uric acid build-up. Regular moderate exercise, such as brisk walking, swimming, or cycling, helps improve insulin sensitivity and aids in maintaining healthy uric acid levels through daily sweating.2. Embrace a balanced, low‑purine dietFocus on whole foods rich in fibre, lean protein, and low-glycaemic starches. Limit intake of purine-heavy foods like red meat, shellfish, and sugary beverages, which can trigger gout attacks and destabilise blood sugar. 3. Prioritise hydrationAdequate hydration supports kidney function and uric acid elimination. Drinking water throughout the day helps dilute serum uric acid and may prevent crystal formation in joints.4. Smart medication choicesSome medications used to manage diabetes offer additional benefits by promoting uric acid excretion. When prescribing for patients with both gout and diabetes, physicians may also consider adjusting uric acid-lowering therapies like allopurinol or febuxostat alongside blood glucose management drugs.Why this mattersBoth gout and diabetes significantly raise the risk of developing cardiovascular and kidney disease. Having both conditions amplifies that danger. By understanding how they interact and tackling both through lifestyle changes, informed medication use, and regular monitoring, patients and clinicians can greatly reduce long-term complications and improve quality of life.Disclaimer: This information is provided for educational purposes only and is not intended to replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

87-year-old Sheila Isaacs reveals her one true love for staying healthy
Sheila Isaacs’ story is a reminder that movement is not just about physical benefits; it’s a way to keep the spirit alive. Whether it’s pedalling down a country lane or cycling by an open garage door, the joy of the ride can be the best medicine of all.

For Sheila Isaacs, it meant gearing up, literally. Now 87, Sheila has been competing in triathlons for over 35 years, and the one activity that has stolen her heart is cycling. It’s more than just exercise for her, it’s joy, freedom, and the key to staying strong well into her 80s.In a recent interview with Women’s Health, Sheila shared how her love for cycling has evolved over the years and why it continues to keep her fit. But what exactly makes cycling such a powerful tool for healthy ageing? 2/6Cycling through the yearsSheila’s relationship with cycling has changed with age. In her 80s, tall racing bikes became harder to mount, so she switched to a shorter stationary bike indoors, still positioned by the open garage door to soak in fresh air and outdoor views.Modifying workouts with age isn’t quitting, it’s smart training. As joints become more sensitive, high-impact activities like running can strain knees and hips. Switching to a low-impact activity like cycling helps maintain cardiovascular health without overloading the joints. It’s a practical example of the saying: “Train smarter, not harder.”3/6Why cycling keeps the body youngerCycling isn’t just a leg workout. It engages the core, improves balance, and boosts cardiovascular endurance. Sheila alternates cycling days with swimming and weightlifting, which keeps her muscles challenged and prevents overuse injuries.According to studies, regular cycling helps maintain bone density, muscle mass, and coordination, all of which naturally decline with age. The steady pedalling motion also promotes better blood circulation, which supports brain function and lowers the risk of age-related cognitive decline.4/6The science of fun and longevitySheila admits that her biggest shift came when she stopped stressing over races and simply started enjoying them. To her, race day is “a swim, a bike ride, and a walk.” That mindset has kept her going for decades.​Researchers have found that people who exercise for enjoyment, not obligation, are far more likely to stick to it long-term. Fun releases dopamine and endorphins, the “happy hormones” that not only lift mood but also reduce inflammation, one of the key factors in age-related diseases.5/6Tracking progress without obsessionSheila has been logging her workouts for 30 years, time, distance, mileage, and even how she feels. This habit helps her adjust training when her joints feel sore and ensures she never pushes beyond healthy limits.Fitness tracking isn’t about chasing numbers; it’s about listening to the body. Studies show that self-monitoring increases awareness of physical limits, which lowers the risk of injury and improves long-term adherence to exercise. It’s the difference between exercising for a few years and exercising for a lifetime.6/6The lesson in Sheila’s pedal powerSheila’s cycling story isn’t just about stamina; it’s about adaptability, joy, and community. At her 200th triathlon, she raced alongside her daughter and granddaughter. Her goal? Not winning, but finishing healthy and happy.This outlook aligns with what longevity experts often say: social connections and meaningful activities are as vital as physical fitness for a long, healthy life. Cycling has given Sheila both a reason to move and a circle of fellow athletes to share it with.[Disclaimer: This article is based on Sheila Isaacs’ personal experience as shared with Women’s Health.

Can your daily cup of coffee or tea boost your mood? Science weighs in
Research indicates that morning caffeine intake, from coffee or tea, can significantly boost positive emotions like alertness and enthusiasm. This effect is most pronounced shortly after waking and is influenced by factors such as sleep quality and social environment.

This effect is most pronounced shortly after waking and is influenced by factors such as sleep quality and social environment. Therefore, a mindful morning beverage routine can enhance mood and set a positive tone for the day.  Starting your day with a cup of coffee or tea is a cherished ritual for millions worldwide, often believed to enhance mood, increase alertness, and provide an energising start to the morning. But how much of this is backed by science? Recent research published in Scientific Reports sheds light on the connection between caffeine consumption and emotional states in everyday life. The study indicates that caffeine intake can produce a small-to-moderate increase in positive emotions, particularly when enjoyed shortly after waking.Interestingly, these mood-boosting effects are most pronounced in the morning and can be influenced by factors such as fatigue levels, sleep quality, and social environment. The research suggests that the familiar comfort and routine of your morning cup, whether coffee or tea, may not only awaken your senses but also subtly improve your emotional well-being. This article delves into the science behind why that morning brew might be more than just a pick-me-up, exploring its effects on mood, alertness, and overall mental state throughout the day.Understanding the impact of morning coffee on moodCoffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages globally, cherished not only for its bold flavor but also for its stimulating and mood-enhancing effects. According to the study, drinking coffee shortly after waking can significantly boost positive emotions such as alertness, enthusiasm, and motivation. This suggests that your morning cup does more than just shake off sleepiness, it provides a mental lift that can help you feel more focused, productive, and optimistic throughout the morning.Interestingly, the study also notes that the mood-enhancing effects of coffee are influenced by factors like sleep quality, social context, and general fatigue levels, meaning that a well-timed cup in the right environment can maximize its benefits. This adds scientific support to the daily ritual many people swear by, showing that your morning brew can be a subtle but effective tool for improving both your mental and emotional wellbeing. Incorporating coffee thoughtfully into your routine may therefore not only jumpstart your day physically but also set a positive tone for your mindset and overall productivity.Does tea consumption enhance emotional well-being?Tea lovers have reason to celebrate too. Like coffee, tea contains caffeine, albeit in smaller amounts, and research shows that drinking tea can also lead to modest improvements in positive emotions, especially when enjoyed in the morning. Beyond caffeine, green and black teas are rich in L-theanine, an amino acid that promotes relaxation, enhances focus, and helps reduce stress. This unique combination of caffeine and L-theanine allows tea to gently boost alertness while keeping the mind calm, making it a perfect morning companion for both mental clarity and a subtle mood lift.Timing your caffeine intake for optimal mood boostTiming is a critical factor in harnessing the full mood-boosting effects of caffeine. According to the study, consuming coffee or tea within the first 2.5 hours after waking leads to a more pronounced increase in positive emotions, including alertness, enthusiasm, and overall mental sharpness. In contrast, caffeine intake later in the day, around 10–12 hours after waking, tends to have a much smaller impact on emotional state, offering minimal mood benefits. This highlights the importance of making your morning beverage an intentional part of your routine rather than just a habit.By enjoying coffee or tea early, you not only energize your body but also enhance your emotional wellbeing, giving your mind a natural lift that can improve focus, motivation, and productivity throughout the morning. Combining the caffeine boost with your usual morning rituals, like a nutritious breakfast or light exercise, can further amplify these effects, making your early hours more productive and mentally uplifting. Ultimately, the timing of your caffeine intake can play a key role in setting a positive tone for the rest of your day.Factors influencing the effectiveness of morning tea or coffeeSeveral factors can modulate how caffeine affects your mood:Tiredness: Those who are sleep-deprived or fatigued may experience stronger positive effects from caffeine.Social Context: Enjoying coffee or tea with friends or colleagues can enhance the mood-boosting effects.Individual Differences: Genetics, habitual caffeine intake, and personal sensitivity can influence results.These factors suggest that the mood benefits of coffee or tea are not solely due to caffeine itself but also the environment and personal habits surrounding its consumption.Scientific insights into caffeine's role in mood regulationThe research emphasizes that caffeine primarily boosts positive emotions, including enthusiasm, energy, and alertness, while having little effect on negative emotions such as sadness or anxiety. This finding supports what millions of coffee and tea drinkers have long observed: that their morning cup can leave them feeling more motivated, cheerful, and ready to tackle the day. By enhancing these uplifting emotions without significantly altering negative moods, caffeine offers a subtle but meaningful way to improve daily mental and emotional wellbeing.Your morning coffee or tea can indeed provide a natural mood boost, especially when consumed shortly after waking. The positive effects are most noticeable in the early hours of the day and can be influenced by fatigue levels, social settings, and individual sensitivity. By enjoying your beverage mindfully and at the right time, you can enhance your morning mood and start your day on a more positive note.Also read| Drinking ginger tea daily?

Whether she’s walking the red carpet, attending a temple visit, or promoting her latest film, Samantha has this uncanny ability to make a six-yard drape feel fresh, current, and endlessly stylish. Her Instagram alone is practically a mood board for anyone who wants to give their saree game a serious upgrade.Here’s how to take a few lessons from Samantha’s playbook and turn the humble saree into your ultimate style weapon.by TOI Lifestyle Desk 2/7​Master the art of mixing texturesOne thing Samantha does better than most is pairing contrasting textures in a way that feels intentional and luxe. You will often spot her wearing a crisp organza saree with a raw silk blouse, or a matte cotton drape with a metallic brocade blouse.The trick? The fabrics should talk to each other, not compete. If the saree has a soft, flowy drape, she’ll go for a blouse with more structure. If the saree is rich and heavy, she’ll balance it with a simpler, lighter blouse.For us mere mortals, this means stepping outside the matching-set mindset. That Kanjeevaram in your cupboard? Try pairing it with a velvet blouse for winter weddings. Got a breezy linen saree? Give it some shine with a sequin or mirror-work blouse.3/7Play with unconventional blouse stylesIf there’s one thing Samantha has taught us, it’s that the blouse can make (or break) your saree look. She isn’t afraid of experimenting, from strappy corset-style cholis to high-neck blouses with dramatic sleeves.The magic is in balancing the mood of the event with the blouse design. For traditional festivities, she leans towards elbow-length sleeves and heritage necklines. For fashion-forward occasions, she isn’t shy about trying halter necks, off-shoulder cuts, or even capes as a blouse alternative.The lesson? Think beyond the regular tailor-cut blouse. Raid Pinterest for ideas, mix in some contemporary silhouettes, and let the blouse set the tone for your entire look.4/7​Keep your jewellery intentionalSamantha’s saree looks are never weighed down with jewellery just for the sake of it. If she’s wearing a heavy, embellished saree, she’ll often let it breathe with just statement earrings. On the flip side, with simpler drapes like a plain tussar or organza, she’ll turn up the drama with chunky temple jewellery or layered necklaces.It’s about intention, not excess. Every piece she wears feels like it belongs, creating harmony instead of visual chaos.If you are styling your own saree, take a beat before reaching for the whole jewellery box. Ask yourself: is the saree the hero or the accessories? Then edit accordingly. Sometimes, less sparkle equals more impact.5/7​Nail the drape for the occasionFrom a crisp corporate pallu for a business event to a loose, casual drape for a day wedding, Samantha always tailors her saree pleats to the moment. She even experiments with belt-cinched sarees for a modern twist, a trick that works wonders for creating shape and adding a little edge.The biggest takeaway here is to treat your saree drape like styling hair or makeup: adapt it to the vibe. A tight, structured drape works for formal occasions, while a relaxed, low-pleat version feels more laid-back and bohemian.Pro tip: if you’re wearing the saree all day, make sure the pleats are pinned securely (a mishap mid-event is never chic). Samantha’s looks always appear effortless because they’re also practical, no tugging or adjusting every five minutes.6/7Let the saree reflect your moodPerhaps Samantha’s most important saree lesson is that she doesn’t wear it like a costume, she wears it like an extension of herself. Some days it’s a blush-pink floral drape that screams romantic and whimsical. Other days, it’s a strong, deep-coloured silk that says, “I mean business.”Fashion is personal, and the saree is one of the most adaptable garments in the world. Feeling playful? Go for bright colours, quirky prints, or ruffled edges. In a minimalist mood? Choose muted tones with subtle detailing.The point is: the saree isn’t just for weddings, pujas, or “special” days. Samantha wears hers to red carpets, movie promotions, and even casual brunches, proving that this centuries-old garment is as everyday-friendly as jeans if you style it right.7/7Magic of Samantha's sareesSamantha Ruth Prabhu’s saree style is the perfect blend of tradition and experimentation. She respects the garment’s heritage but refuses to treat it as untouchable. Instead, she makes it personal, modern, and infinitely wearable.So the next time you’re staring at your saree collection wondering how to make it feel fresh, remember: mix textures, play with blouse styles, be intentional with jewellery, drape for the occasion, and above all, let the saree reflect you.The magic of Samantha’s saree looks isn’t in the price tags or designer labels, it’s in the way she wears them with confidence and joy. And that, more than any styling trick, is the ultimate tip worth stealing.Follow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousSet up a mini lotus pond at home with these easy tipsindiaJanmashtami 2025: How to make Makhana Paag at home forChhappan BhogFoodAttractive looks of Srithika SaneeshindiaSheet masks out, Kareena Kapoor Khan’s DIY napkin mask inindia10 creatures that can walk on waterindia​Bhagyashri Borse charms with her gorgeous outfits​indiaThese Zodiac Signs Play the Victim When They’re Actually in Controlindia10 things to know before getting a pet rabbitindiaThe Great Indian saf​ari: 9 wildlife trips beyond tigers and leopardstravel Next123 Photostories  Cooku With Comali 6: From Shabana Shajahan to Lakshmy Ramakrishnan – Meet the top 6 cooks of the season​'Coolie': Five big reasons to experience Rajinikanth and Lokesh Kanagaraj’s film on the big screenAnanya Panday moments that show her unstoppable rise to stardomDesi face masks which promise a glowing skin7 brain-boosting foods every child should eat and quick recipesFrom reunion with Asit Kumar Modi to unseen pictures: Times when Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah’s Disha Vakani aka Dayaben made headlinesFrom Gokarna to Varkala — 8 beautiful coastal towns of India that are a must-visit in this lifetime8.5 quintals of adulterated mawa seized in Hisar: 5 ways to do mawa purity test at homeThis is what happens when you drink fennel tea on an empty stomach123lifestyle videos13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement16:34Life After 60: Why India's seniors are choosing community living04:34Control Your Senses, Gain Knowledge, Attain Peace: Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4.3906:37Cultural Clashes in Love: How To Make Your Relationship Work03:19Prayagraj MahaKumbh 2025 Readies For Millions: Massive Preparations Underway In Uttar Pradesh04:48Sadhguru Reveals The Truth About Black Magic And Your Photograph07:18BK Shivani On Forgiveness: Why It’s Essential For Inner Peace08:08How Bhairavi Sadhana Accelerates Your Path to Liberation: Sadhguru Speaks06:47Breakup Recovery: How To Not Wallow In Misery And Love Yourself03:20The Purifying Power of Yajna: Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4, Verse 3011:41How Dattatreya Accepted Parashuram as His Disciple – Sadhguru Reveals03:54Can Water Remember?

Do you have children and are thinking which popular pet dog is better-- Labrador Retriever or Beagle? Well, Labrador Retrievers and Beagles are two of the most popular breeds across the world, and both are known for their friendliness and playfulness. However, they do have certain differences that can make one dog breed more suitable for your household than the other, depending on your needs. So, here we list some key differences between the two that will help you select the right pet dog for you:2/8TemperamentLabrador Retrievers are known for being gentle, fun-loving, and patient— which makes them perfect pets for families with kids of all ages. Beagles too are friendly and playful, but they have a stronger independent streak, which can make them a bit mischievous.3/8Size and space needsThis is one of the most striing differences between the two pet dog breeds. Labradors are large and they need more space to move freely; and so, they are more suitable for people with large homes and bungalows. Whereas, due to their small size Beagles are perfect pets for people living in apartments or smaller homes.4/8Energy levelsBoth Labradors and Beagles are active, when it comes to their energy levels. But Labs need more structured exercise and outdoor play to stay active and healthy. Whereas, Beagles have bursts of high energy but can be happy with regular short walks and play sessions too.5/8 Grooming and sheddingBoth Labs and Beagles shed moderately. However, Labradors may shed a bit more seasonally. On the contrary, due to their short coats,  Beagles are easier to groom and maintain. Both the dog breeds need regular brushing to keep their coats clean and healthy.6/8TrainabilityDue to their people pleasing nature, Labradors respond well to training and positive reinforcement. This makes them great pets even for first-time owners. Beagles, on the other hand, are intelligent but can also be stubborn. And so, a person needs to handle them with a lot of patience and consistent positive reinforcement.7/8Health issuesLabradors are known to be more prone to joint issues like hip dysplasia. Meanwhile Beagles are prone to ear infections due to their floppy ears. Both the dog breeds need regular vet care to ensure they stay healthy.8/8Compatibility with kids Labradors are known for their patience and tolerance, which makes them perfect for younger children. While Beagles are equally affectionate, they may be better with slightly older kids who can match their playful energy and need for independence too at times.Follow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: How to make Makhana Paag at home forChhappan BhogFoodAttractive looks of Srithika SaneeshindiaSheet masks out, Kareena Kapoor Khan’s DIY napkin mask inindia10 creatures that can walk on waterindia​Bhagyashri Borse charms with her gorgeous outfits​indiaThese Zodiac Signs Play the Victim When They’re Actually in Controlindia10 things to know before getting a pet rabbitindiaThe Great Indian saf​ari: 9 wildlife trips beyond tigers and leopardstravelDiarrhea: What to eat and avoid when the stomach is upsetindia Next123 Photostories  Cooku With Comali 6: From Shabana Shajahan to Lakshmy Ramakrishnan – Meet the top 6 cooks of the season​'Coolie': Five big reasons to experience Rajinikanth and Lokesh Kanagaraj’s film on the big screenAnanya Panday moments that show her unstoppable rise to stardomDesi face masks which promise a glowing skin7 brain-boosting foods every child should eat and quick recipesFrom reunion with Asit Kumar Modi to unseen pictures: Times when Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah’s Disha Vakani aka Dayaben made headlinesFrom Gokarna to Varkala — 8 beautiful coastal towns of India that are a must-visit in this lifetime8.5 quintals of adulterated mawa seized in Hisar: 5 ways to do mawa purity test at homeThis is what happens when you drink fennel tea on an empty stomach123lifestyle videos13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement16:34Life After 60: Why India's seniors are choosing community living04:34Control Your Senses, Gain Knowledge, Attain Peace: Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4.3906:37Cultural Clashes in Love: How To Make Your Relationship Work03:19Prayagraj MahaKumbh 2025 Readies For Millions: Massive Preparations Underway In Uttar Pradesh04:48Sadhguru Reveals The Truth About Black Magic And Your Photograph07:18BK Shivani On Forgiveness: Why It’s Essential For Inner Peace08:08How Bhairavi Sadhana Accelerates Your Path to Liberation: Sadhguru Speaks06:47Breakup Recovery: How To Not Wallow In Misery And Love Yourself03:20The Purifying Power of Yajna: Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4, Verse 3011:41How Dattatreya Accepted Parashuram as His Disciple – Sadhguru Reveals03:54Can Water Remember?

This guide offers quick solutions to reduce its size and redness overnight. It combines natural remedies like tea tree oil and aloe vera with over-the-counter treatments containing salicylic acid. Also, it emphasizes the importance of gentle skincare and avoiding harsh treatments to protect your skin's health.  Waking up with a pimple can be incredibly frustrating, especially when you have an important meeting, party, or photoshoot lined up. That angry red bump can feel like it’s stealing all the attention, and the urge to make it disappear instantly is understandable. While completely eliminating a pimple overnight is nearly impossible, there are tried-and-tested methods to significantly reduce its size, redness, and inflammation in just a few hours. By combining natural ingredients, simple home treatments, and targeted over-the-counter products, you can calm irritation, shrink swelling, and make your skin look noticeably smoother by morning.The key lies in choosing remedies that work quickly without damaging your skin barrier because harsh treatments can sometimes make things worse. From ice therapy and spot treatments to soothing herbal options, there are safe, effective ways to give your skin the overnight boost it needs. Here’s a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to remove pimples overnight while protecting your skin’s health.Natural remedies to remove pimples overnightTea tree oil spot treatmentStudies by NIH show that tea tree oil is a potent antibacterial and anti-inflammatory agent. It helps fight the bacteria that cause pimples, reduces redness, soothes swelling, and can accelerate the healing process, making breakouts less noticeable and preventing future flare-ups when used correctly.How to use: Dilute a few drops in a carrier oil like coconut or jojoba oil. Apply directly to the affected area before bedtime.Aloe vera gelResearch done by NIH confirms that aloe vera is renowned for its soothing and anti-inflammatory properties. Applying fresh aloe gel to pimples can calm redness, reduce swelling, and promote healing overnight.How to use: Extract fresh gel from an aloe leaf and apply a thin layer to the pimple before sleeping. Wash off in the morning with lukewarm water.Ice compressCold therapy is an easy way to reduce puffiness and redness. Ice constricts blood vessels and reduces inflammation.How to use: Wrap a small ice cube in a clean cloth and gently press it against the pimple for 3–5 minutes. Repeat 2–3 times.Honey and cinnamon maskAccording to research published in Research Gate, honey and cinnamon have natural antibacterial and antimicrobial properties. Together, they can help fight bacteria and soothe irritated skin.How to use: Mix 1 teaspoon of honey with ½ teaspoon of cinnamon to form a paste. Apply directly to the pimple and leave it on overnight. Wash off in the morning.Over-the-counter spot treatmentsProducts containing salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide are widely recommended by dermatologists. They work by unclogging pores, drying out excess oil, and killing bacteria.How to use: Apply a small amount to the pimple as directed on the product label. Avoid overuse, as these ingredients can irritate skin if applied too heavily.Tips to reduce pimples fasterAvoid touching your face: Your hands carry bacteria that can worsen pimples.Keep skin clean: Gently cleanse your face twice daily with a mild cleanser.Use non-comedogenic products: Choose skincare and makeup products that won’t clog pores.Stay hydrated: Drinking water helps flush out toxins and supports skin healing.Get enough sleep: Rest allows your body to repair and rejuvenate skin overnight.Pimples form when excess oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria clog pores. The sooner you treat them, the faster you can reduce swelling and prevent further inflammation. Overnight treatments work by soothing the skin, targeting bacteria, and drying out excess oil, all of which help the pimple heal faster.While no remedy can completely erase pimples overnight, combining these treatments with consistent skincare habits can significantly reduce their appearance. If breakouts persist or worsen, it’s always best to consult a dermatologist for tailored advice. By following these tips, you can wake up to calmer, less inflamed skin and keep your complexion healthy and glowing.Also read| 5 common mistakes older women make that worsen hair lossAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

She cut out dairy and ate high-fiber foods. She also did facial exercises. These changes helped her get a more sculpted look. Eliminating dairy reduces bloating. Fiber-rich foods aid weight management. Chewing hard foods tones facial muscles. Detox juices and hydration are important. Regular facial exercises improve muscle tone.  Waking up to a puffy face or noticing extra roundness in your cheeks can be frustrating, especially when you want a more sculpted, defined look. While genetics and overall body weight play a role in facial fat, lifestyle choices such as diet, hydration, and targeted exercises can make a significant difference. In her July 30 Instagram post, Anushka Vyas shared the diet and exercise routine that helped her achieve a slimmer, more sculpted face. Her approach focused on cutting out dairy, eating high-fiber foods, and practicing facial exercises to tone muscles. By making these manageable changes, she achieved noticeable results, proving that natural methods can work wonders when followed consistently.Many people tend to overlook the fact that reducing facial fat requires a holistic approach rather than relying on spot reduction alone. While some quick fixes might temporarily reduce puffiness, sustainable results come from combining the right nutrition, hydration, and muscle-toning exercises.Simple diet and exercise tips to slim your faceEliminate dairy from your dietAnushka’s most impactful dietary change was cutting out dairy completely. Dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt can sometimes lead to water retention and bloating, making the face appear puffier than it actually is. By eliminating dairy, she noticed a significant reduction in facial bloating within a few weeks.Tip: Replace dairy with plant-based alternatives like almond milk, soy milk, or oat milk.Why it works: Less water retention means a naturally leaner, more contoured look.Include high-fiber foodsFiber-rich foods are essential for overall weight management, which also helps reduce facial fat. Anushka emphasizes the importance of including foods like spinach, kale, beetroot, berries, and apples. These help you feel fuller for longer, preventing overeating and unnecessary snacking.Tip: Add leafy greens to every meal and snack on fruits like apples or berries throughout the day.Benefit: High-fiber foods support digestion and help flush out toxins, indirectly contributing to a slimmer facial appearance.Eat hard-to-chew foodsOne of Anushka’s secrets is foods that require more chewing, which helps tone the jaw and cheek muscles over time. By engaging facial muscles regularly, these foods stimulate muscle tone and improve definition, giving your face a naturally sculpted look without invasive procedures.Tip: Include crunchy, fiber-rich foods like raw vegetables, nuts, and corn in your diet to engage facial muscles regularly. Benefit: This stimulates muscle tone and improves definition, giving your face a naturally sculpted look without any invasive procedures.Stay hydrated with detox juicesHydration plays a vital role in reducing puffiness and supporting overall health. Anushka suggests detox juices to flush out toxins and prevent water retention.Detox juice recipe:One slice of petha (winter squash)1 tsp turmeric (haldi)Juice of half a cucumberOne twig of meetha neem (curry leaves)Drinking this combination regularly can aid digestion, reduce bloating, and promote a slimmer facial appearance.Practice facial exercisesWhile spot reduction isn’t possible, certain facial exercises help tone muscles, improving overall definition. Anushka includes exercises that target the jawline, cheeks, and neck. Regular facial exercises improve blood circulation, tighten skin, and prevent sagging, giving your face a naturally toned and youthful look.Tip: Practice these exercises for 10–15 minutes daily to see noticeable results. Benefit: Regular practice strengthens and sculpts facial muscles, enhancing your natural facial contours over time.Other lifestyle tips to reduce face fatBeyond diet and exercises, several habits can further help reduce facial fat:Limit salt intake: Excess salt causes water retention and puffiness.Avoid processed sugar: High sugar consumption contributes to fat accumulation and inflammation.Sleep well: Adequate sleep reduces stress and cortisol, which can cause facial bloating.Stay active: Overall body fat reduction through cardio or strength training reflects on your face too.Combining these habits with Anushka’s routine ensures faster and sustainable results.Reducing face fat naturally is entirely achievable with the right combination of diet, hydration, and facial exercises. As Anushka Vyas demonstrated in her July 30 Instagram post, cutting out dairy, eating fiber-rich and hard-to-chew foods, staying hydrated with detox juices, and practicing targeted facial exercises can dramatically improve facial appearance.Consistency is key. While changes won’t happen overnight, following this routine regularly can help you achieve a slimmer, more sculpted face safely and naturally. Always remember to consult a healthcare professional before making significant changes to your diet or exercise routine, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions. By incorporating these tips, you can not only reduce face fat but also improve your overall health, confidence, and well-being.Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

This temple in Rajasthan stood against thousands of bombs: The untold story of war, faith and Indian Army
Tanot Mata Temple near Jaisalmer, close to the Longewala battlefield, stands as a symbol of faith and resilience. During the 1965 and 1971 Indo-Pak wars, the temple miraculously survived bombings, with unexploded bombs now displayed as testaments to divine protection. Maintained by the BSF, the temple is a revered site for soldiers.

During the 1965 and 1971 Indo-Pak wars, the temple miraculously survived bombings, with unexploded bombs now displayed as testaments to divine protection. Maintained by the BSF, the temple is a revered site for soldiers.  ‘Sandese aate hain, hume tadpate hain’, it’s not just a song but the emotions of many! These lyrics are the emotions of every member of a family whose sons and daughters are serving their nations, standing on borders and guarding their homelands with their lives. Parts of the song, from the blockbuster movie ‘Border’ were extensively shot near the 1971 Battle of Longewala ground, near Jaisalmer which is also home to the revered Tanot Mata Temple.Tanot Mata is not an ordinary temple. This Hindu temple in Jaisalmer district, Rajasthan, is located near the border with Pakistan. It is where the Longewala war happened during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 where India came out victorious.Live bombs from the war, the storyThe temple is unique in many senses as it houses live bombs from the war. During the Indo-Pak war in 1965, the temple was attacked by over 3,000 bombs. But as per local lore, these bombs some missed their target and some did not explode. Soon after, India's Border Security Force (BSF) took charge of the maintenance of the temple and nearby region.Later, in 1971, Tanot was again attacked during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 (Battle of Longewala). The border was attacked by tanks but they could not get in and went down in the sand. After winning the war, a Vijay Stambha or a Victory tower was built inside the temple. The bombs that did not explode were placed inside the temple. These heavy looking bombs are now put on display on shelves inside the temple covered by glass doors. The tanks are placed close to the temple near the border. There’s also a cute cafe called ‘Border’ cafe and a theater room where only ‘Border’ (the movie) plays.Soldiers praying groundThis is an important temple for soldiers who regularly pray here. They have immense faith in the deity and believe that the goddess protects them from any harm. It is quite an emotional scene looking at these strong soldiers breaking down in front of the goddess's statue to seek her blessings.Who was Tanot MataAs per history books, the temple was built by the Bhati Rajput King Tanu Rao in 828 AD. And since then, the temple became popular among people of Jaisalmer. As per the Charan records, the deity here is the incarnation of Hinglaj Mata and who later reincarnated as the Karni Mata.Legend has it that a man named Mamadji Charan has no kids. He decided to visit Hinglaj Mata on foot seven times to get a child. Then Hinglaj Mata asked him whether he wanted a son or a daughter, the man asked the goddess herself to take birth at his house in the form of their own kid. Soon after, the man was blessed with seven daughters and one son and one among them was Aavad Mata, also known as Tanot Mata.Victory Memorial and the war museumThere is a Victory Memorial and a war museum housing the unexploded Pakistani bombs and tanks. On 16th December every year, the victory of India is celebrated at the temple. Today, the temple along with the war memorial museum are a part of Bharat Ranbhoomi Darshan initiative of the Indian Military. It was done to boost border tourism.How to reachBy Train: Tanot Mata temple is only 120 km from Jaisalmer city. The Jaisalmer Railway station is the nearest to the temple. Visitors can hire local cabs or taxis to reach here. It takes around two hours to reach.By Air: The closest airport to Tanot Mata is in Jodhpur. From here, you can book cab rentals that take some four hours to reach the city.Best time to visitThe best time to explore this temple is between November and January. The weather remains rosy and pleasant during this time. Because the temperature is comfortable, it is easier to explore the temple and nearby regions.So next time you plan a trip to Jaisalmer, make sure you visit Tanot Mata temple.About the AuthorPriya SrivastavaComing from the ‘City of Nawabs’, Lucknow, Priya’s sole motto is to explore life through journeys to unexplored destinations and knitting travel stories.

Oh, and Sydney? She posted a Story that featured MGK and Patrick Schwarzenegger too. Coincidence? We think not.mgk and Sydney Sweeney reunite at the opening of the Palm Tree Beach Club in Las Vegas on May 3, 2025.

A fan named Kyle P asked the question on all of our minds: “Is there any truth to the rumour that you and Sydney Sweeney are more than just friends?”

Not laughing they are investigating.Sources say MGK’s response was dripping in deflection. “He laughed it off, but didn’t exactly deny the closeness,” one fan posted. Another noted: “The way he avoided the question? Classic situationship energy.”

She starred in his 2021 directorial debut Downfalls High and appeared alongside him and Pete Davidson in Big Time Adolescence back in 2019. So yes, they have history, but is it friendly or flirty? Both are now single. MGK officially split from Megan Fox in December 2024 and recently welcomed baby Saga (yes, that is the name) with her.

The stars have aligned, literally.Alien dads, frank sinatra, and more chaosAs if that was not enough weirdness, MGK veered into sci-fi territory during the same interview. When asked about age, he said he was unsure if it “exists” and hinted at possibly having alien origins. Allegedly, he once asked his mum if she had ever disappeared mysteriously, and she admitted to an abduction. Yup, that happened.Also, his dream musical collab? Frank Sinatra. MGK said he “likes Frank” and would love to collab.

Effective home remedies to get rid of ‘tiddas’ or grasshoppers from your home and garden
Grasshoppers, often mistaken for locusts, can enter homes seeking food, drawn by bright lights and lush plants. Unlike locusts, they're solitary and less destructive. Effective control involves removing attractants, using natural repellents like garlic or neem oil sprays, and blocking entry points with screens. Early action and avoiding harsh chemicals are crucial for managing these pests.

Unlike locusts, they're solitary and less destructive. Effective control involves removing attractants, using natural repellents like garlic or neem oil sprays, and blocking entry points with screens. Early action and avoiding harsh chemicals are crucial for managing these pests.  Grasshoppers, also known as tiddas in Hindi, are common garden insects that sometimes make their way into homes. While usually harmless when alone, they can nibble on your plants and cause frustration if not controlled. Their resemblance to locusts often confuses gardeners, but the two behave very differently. Grasshoppers tend to stay in small numbers, hopping around quietly, whereas locusts appear in large swarms and can devastate crops in no time. Knowing the difference and using natural, home-based remedies can help you keep your garden and living spaces free from these pests without resorting to harsh chemicals.Why do grasshoppers come inside homesGrasshoppers generally enter homes and gardens in search of food, particularly green and leafy plants. Environmental factors also influence their movement. High temperatures, dry conditions, or bright lights on porches and inside homes can attract them, especially at night. Unlike locusts, which move in large groups, grasshoppers are usually solitary and prefer to hop around quietly in search of suitable vegetation. By recognising the conditions that draw them indoors, you can take preventive measures to minimise their intrusion.How to distinguish between grasshoppers and locustsGrasshoppers and locusts look quite similar at first glance. Both have long legs and strong jumping abilities and can fly. The key difference lies in their behaviour and numbers. Grasshoppers tend to be solitary or appear in small groups. Locusts, however, form large swarms and can rapidly consume crops and garden plants. Observing whether insects are alone or in groups helps determine the appropriate control method and prevents unnecessary alarm.Tips to get rid of grasshoppers at home and in the gardenManaging grasshoppers effectively involves a combination of prevention, natural repellents, and physical barriers. The following strategies can help:Remove what attracts themOvergrown plants, clusters of pots near windows or doors, and garden lights at night can draw grasshoppers inside. Regularly trimming vegetation and repositioning pots away from entry points can significantly reduce their presence. Switching off garden lights when not needed can also discourage them from approaching homes.Use natural spraysHome-made sprays can act as effective repellents. Mixing water with garlic or neem oil and applying it to plants helps deter grasshoppers. Additionally, planting herbs like basil or flowers such as marigolds around gardens can naturally repel these insects, as they dislike strong smells.Block entry pointsInstalling mesh screens on windows and doors prevents grasshoppers from entering living spaces. If an insect does manage to get inside, gently guiding it out with a broom or catching it in a jar and releasing it outdoors is the safest method. These non-chemical approaches protect both household members and pets from exposure to harmful substances.Common mistakes to avoid while removing grasshoppersMany people make the mistake of using harsh chemical sprays inside the house when trying to get rid of outdoor insects. Such chemicals can be harmful to both humans and pets. Instead, it is better to focus on controlling the outdoor environment where grasshoppers originate.Prompt action is crucial. Waiting until insects are already inside can mean they have caused damage to plants or household areas. Preventive measures such as turning off outdoor lights at night and maintaining a tidy garden will significantly reduce the likelihood of infestation. Acting early and consistently is key to keeping grasshoppers away.Grasshoppers or tiddas can be more than just a minor nuisance if they find their way into your garden or home. By understanding their behaviour, identifying them correctly, and taking preventive steps, you can protect your plants and living spaces. Focus on outdoor maintenance, use safe home sprays, and block entry points to effectively manage these insects.

Harvard expert reveals jobs that may protect you from Alzheimer’s disease
A Harvard study reveals that taxi and ambulance drivers have lower Alzheimer's-related death rates, potentially due to the constant mental navigation required in their jobs. This active navigation may strengthen the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for memory. Engaging in activities that demand spatial reasoning could offer similar brain benefits, though further research is needed.

This active navigation may strengthen the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for memory. Engaging in activities that demand spatial reasoning could offer similar brain benefits, though further research is needed.  A Harvard Health Publishing report highlights a surprising link between certain occupations and a lower risk of dying from Alzheimer’s disease (AD). According to research reviewed by Dr. Robert H. Shmerling, taxi and ambulance drivers show markedly lower rates of AD-related deaths compared with many other professions. Scientists believe the mental demands of real-time navigation in these jobs may strengthen the hippocampus, a brain region critical for memory and spatial awareness, and one of the first areas affected by Alzheimer’s. If confirmed, these findings could open new doors in understanding and preventing the disease.Ambulance and taxi driver jobs may protect against Alzheimer’sEarlier studies on London taxi drivers revealed enlargement in specific areas of the hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for spatial memory. This region is particularly vulnerable to the damage caused by Alzheimer’s. Researchers suspect that the constant mental mapping, route planning, and decision-making involved in taxi and ambulance driving help preserve hippocampal health. These jobs often require drivers to process incoming information instantly, adapt to changing traffic patterns, and find the most efficient routes in unfamiliar areas. Over time, this mental workout may strengthen neural connections in the brain, potentially slowing or preventing the deterioration associated with Alzheimer’s disease.What the new study foundThe study examined data from nearly nine million death certificates, focusing on 443 occupations. After adjusting for the average age of death, the researchers discovered striking differences in Alzheimer’s-related mortality rates. Alzheimer’s accounted for just 0.91 percent of deaths among taxi drivers and 1.03 percent among ambulance drivers. This was more than 40 percent lower than the general population average and significantly lower than the 1.82 percent observed among chief executives. Pilots and ship captains had some of the highest rates, with 2.34 percent and 2.12 percent respectively. The findings suggest that the level of active navigation required in a job could be an important factor, although the benefit was not observed for other types of dementia.Why other navigation jobs are not equally protectiveWhile jobs like piloting an aircraft, captaining a ship, or driving a bus might seem similar in navigational demands, researchers explain that these roles often follow fixed routes or rely heavily on automated systems. Pilots can depend on autopilot and air traffic control, ship captains may navigate pre-determined sea routes, and bus drivers typically repeat the same path daily. As a result, the cognitive challenge is less intense and less varied compared to taxi and ambulance drivers, who must constantly adapt to new road conditions, passenger destinations, and emergency scenarios. This constant need for flexible problem-solving may be key to the observed brain benefits.Could everyday activities have the same effect?Experts believe it may be possible to gain similar brain benefits outside of professional driving. Activities that demand spatial reasoning and complex navigation skills could potentially help maintain hippocampal function. Examples include orienteering, geocaching, and hiking in unfamiliar terrain using a map and compass. Even indoor activities such as jigsaw puzzles, solving Rubik’s Cubes, or playing spatially challenging video games like Tetris and Minecraft might provide cognitive stimulation. However, researchers caution that there is still no definitive proof that such activities reduce Alzheimer’s risk in the same way these occupations appear to. Further studies will be needed to confirm whether these recreational tasks have long-term protective effects.The takeawayWhile this research does not conclusively prove that driving a taxi or ambulance prevents Alzheimer’s disease, it adds weight to the theory that mentally challenging and spatially demanding activities can help protect brain health. Harvard experts recommend that people interested in lowering their Alzheimer’s risk should combine mentally stimulating activities with other proven lifestyle measures. These include maintaining regular physical activity, eating a nutrient-rich diet, managing cardiovascular health, staying socially connected, and ensuring good sleep quality. Together, these strategies offer the best chance of reducing the likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia.About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Her story reveals how ignoring fatigue and discomfort, coupled with a sedentary lifestyle, undermined her well-being. Experts emphasize that managing stress, staying active, and listening to your body are crucial for holistic health and cancer prevention, regardless of diet.  In an age where wellness trends and clean eating dominate, many assume that a meticulously planned diet is enough to ensure lasting health. The story of 29-year-old Monika Choudhary, diagnosed with stage 4 colorectal cancer, challenges this perception. Despite adhering to a disciplined, nutrient-rich diet, Monika’s experience reveals how chronic stress, burnout, and inactivity can silently undermine even the healthiest lifestyle. Her journey underscores that holistic health involves more than nutrition—it demands balance between mental wellness, physical activity, and self-care.Perfect diet, hidden dangers: How stress and inactivity fuel serious health risksMonika had long maintained what many consider the ideal lifestyle. Her meals were clean, balanced, and free from fried or processed foods, reflecting widely recommended health principles. Friends and colleagues often praised her dedication to eating well, believing it was a foolproof way to maintain vitality. Yet, in July 2025, Monika received a diagnosis that would shatter this assumption: stage 4 colorectal cancer.Her story demonstrates a crucial point: a perfect diet alone cannot shield the body from the cumulative effects of chronic stress and inactivity. Even when nutrition is optimal, lifestyle factors like long work hours, prolonged sitting, and mental strain can create conditions that compromise overall health.Stage 4 cancer warning signs: Slow health decline from stress and little activityMonika’s health decline was gradual. At first, it was easy to ignore: slight fatigue after work, mild physical discomfort, and an uneasy feeling that something was off. However, over time, the warning signs became more persistent:Loss of physical routine: Once an avid runner, Monika had abandoned her evening runs, which previously served as both therapy and stress relief.Extended periods of inactivity: Days were largely spent indoors, seated at her desk or in front of screens, with minimal movement.Chronic mental fatigue: The relentless pressure of managing her own website led to ongoing exhaustion, often dismissed as normal work-related stress.These seemingly small shifts in routine had a cumulative effect on her body, silently setting the stage for serious health consequences.How stress, inactivity, and ignored symptoms lead to cancerStress and inactivity affect the body in profound, often invisible ways. Chronic mental stress triggers hormonal imbalances, which can increase inflammation and weaken the immune system. Physical inactivity further compounds these issues by reducing circulation, slowing metabolism, and impairing detoxification processes. Together, these factors create an environment in which diseases, including cancer, can develop and progress more aggressively. Monika herself reflected on the months leading up to her diagnosis: “Looking back, I realize it wasn’t just bad luck. It was the cumulative effect of ignoring my body, letting stress dominate my life, and becoming sedentary.”The reality hit hard when Monika received the stage 4 colorectal cancer diagnosis. Despite years of disciplined eating and avoiding unhealthy foods, her body had reached a critical point. Her experience highlights a vital truth: no diet, no matter how perfect, can fully counteract the hidden toll of chronic stress and physical inactivity.Monika’s diagnosis also underscores how early warning signs are often overlooked. Persistent fatigue, unease, and minor physical discomfort may feel inconsequential, but they are signals that the body is struggling. Ignoring these signs can allow underlying conditions to progress unnoticed until they become life-threatening.How lifestyle factors like stress and inactivity causes cancer riskChronic stress and hormonal imbalanceProlonged stress triggers the release of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can weaken the immune system over time. A suppressed immune system struggles to detect and destroy abnormal cells, increasing the risk of cancer development.Physical inactivity and poor circulationSedentary lifestyles reduce blood circulation and lymphatic flow, slowing the removal of toxins and impairing nutrient delivery to cells. This creates an environment where abnormal cell growth can thrive.Ignoring early warning signsPersistent fatigue, discomfort, and unexplained unease are often dismissed as normal stress or busy schedules. Ignoring these subtle signals allows underlying conditions to progress unchecked, potentially escalating to serious illnesses, including cancer.Cumulative lifestyle impactEven with a healthy diet, long-term burnout, screen overuse, and lack of exercise can accumulate damage at the cellular level. Oxidative stress and inflammation caused by these factors further increase cancer risk.Prevention tips: How to reduce cancer risk from stress, inactivity, and ignored symptomsManage stress proactivelyIncorporate mindfulness practices, meditation, and regular breaks into your daily routine. Reducing stress helps regulate hormone levels and supports immune function.Stay physically activeAim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily, including walking, jogging, or yoga. Physical activity improves circulation, boosts immunity, and reduces cancer risk.Listen to your bodyTake note of persistent fatigue, discomfort, or other unusual symptoms. Early detection of changes can significantly improve outcomes.Maintain a balanced lifestyleCombine a nutrient-rich diet with sufficient sleep, hydration, and social support. Balance between mental, physical, and emotional health is key for long-term wellness.Schedule regular medical check-upsRoutine screenings, lab tests, and consultations help detect potential issues before they escalate, increasing the chances of early intervention.Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

However, excessive consumption may lead to digestive issues like bloating and gas. It can also affect blood pressure and blood sugar levels, especially for those with pre-existing conditions. Allergic reactions, though rare, are possible. Moderation and awareness of individual health are crucial for safe enjoyment.  Dragon fruit, also known as pitaya or kamalam, has quickly become a favourite for health-conscious people thanks to its striking look and powerful nutrients. Packed with vitamin C, fiber, antioxidants, protein, iron, and magnesium, it supports immunity, aids digestion, and helps keep your skin glowing. Native to Southeast Asia and South America, its sweet-tangy flavour is often compared to a mix of kiwi and pear. While this tropical superfood can boost your health, eating too much or ignoring precautions may cause side effects such as digestive discomfort, allergies, blood sugar changes, or interactions with certain medications.Before you eat dragon fruit, know these 7 side effectsDigestive IssuesDragon fruit contains a significant amount of dietary fiber, which is beneficial for maintaining healthy digestion. According to a study published in NIH, consuming too much fiber at once can have the opposite effect, leading to bloating, gas, stomach pain, diarrhea, or indigestion. Individuals with pre-existing digestive conditions should consume dragon fruit in moderation to avoid discomfort. Starting with small portions and gradually increasing intake can help your digestive system adjust to the fiber content.Effects on blood pressureDragon fruit may have a mild blood pressure-lowering effect, which can be advantageous for people with hypertension. On the other hand, those with naturally low blood pressure should exercise caution. Excessive consumption could cause dizziness, fatigue, or weakness. If you already have low blood pressure, it is advisable to limit dragon fruit intake and monitor your symptoms.Risk of weight gainAlthough dragon fruit is low in calories compared to many desserts or snacks, it still contains natural sugars. Eating it in large quantities can contribute to an increased calorie intake, potentially leading to weight gain. This is particularly relevant for people with diabetes or those trying to manage their weight. Moderation is key, and pairing dragon fruit with protein or fiber-rich foods can help maintain balanced blood sugar levels.Allergic reactionsWhile uncommon, some individuals may be allergic to dragon fruit. According to a study published on ResearchGate, allergic responses can range from mild to severe, including itching, skin rashes, swelling of the face or lips, difficulty breathing, and in rare cases, anaphylaxis. People with a history of fruit allergies should consult a healthcare professional before introducing dragon fruit into their diet.Blood sugar considerationsDragon fruit contains natural sugars that can affect blood sugar levels. For people with diabetes or those monitoring their glucose, consuming it in large amounts may lead to sudden spikes. It is important to eat dragon fruit in moderation and consult a doctor or dietitian to determine safe portion sizes. Pairing the fruit with protein or healthy fats can help stabilise blood sugar and reduce the risk of rapid increases. Being mindful of portion size and balancing it with other foods ensures you can enjoy dragon fruit safely without adversely affecting your blood sugar.Interactions with medicationsDragon fruit may interact with certain medications, particularly those used to manage blood pressure, blood sugar, or allergies. Consuming the fruit while on these medications could enhance or reduce their effectiveness. It is best to consult a healthcare provider before adding dragon fruit to your diet if you take prescription medications.Changes in urine or stool colourEating the red variety of dragon fruit may temporarily change the colour of your urine or stool to pink or red. Although harmless, this can be alarming if unexpected. Excessive consumption may also lead to imbalances in certain nutrients over time, as the fruit is rich in specific vitamins and minerals that, in high quantities, can disrupt nutrient balance.Tips for safe consumption of Dragon Fruit To enjoy dragon fruit safely and maximize its benefits, follow these guidelines:Wash the fruit thoroughly before consumption to remove any contaminants.Cut the fruit in half and scoop out the pulp with a spoon.Dice it for use in fruit salads, smoothies, or yogurt for added nutrition.The seeds are edible and can be eaten along with the flesh.Consume in moderation, particularly if you have digestive issues, low blood pressure, or diabetes.Dragon fruit is a nutritious and versatile fruit, but like any food, it should be consumed mindfully. By understanding its potential side effects and following safe consumption practices, you can enjoy its health benefits without compromising your well-being. Moderation, balanced diet, and awareness of personal health conditions are key to making the most of this tropical superfood.Also Read: Celebrate Krishna Janmashtami with these 7 sacred bhog offering recipesAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Several factors contribute to this issue. Harsh hair products, tight hairstyles, and rough handling worsen the problem. Poor nutrition and unmanaged stress also play a role. Women can slow hair loss by making simple changes. Choosing gentle products and avoiding tight styles help.  Hair loss is a common concern for many older women, often caused by a mix of genetic, hormonal, and lifestyle factors. While some changes are inevitable with age, certain habits can accelerate thinning and make hair more fragile. These mistakes range from harsh haircare routines and poor nutrition to unmanaged stress. By recognising and addressing these avoidable triggers, women can help slow the rate of hair loss and maintain stronger, fuller strands. Understanding what damages hair and making small adjustments in daily care can have a significant impact on preserving hair health and boosting confidence over time.5 reasons why women over 50 experience faster hair lossUsing harmful haircare products without checking labelsWith endless haircare products on the market, choosing the right ones can be overwhelming. Many shampoos, conditioners, and styling products contain harsh chemicals that may weaken hair or accelerate shedding. Ingredients such as formaldehyde, sodium lauryl sulfate, propylene glycol, glycol distearate, and sodium chloride can strip moisture, irritate the scalp, and damage follicles. Even products marketed as “strengthening” or “repairing” can be misleading.For example, keratin, a protein naturally found in hair, is often added to treatments to create shine. However, when combined with heat styling, it can actually cause brittleness and breakage, especially if the formula contains formaldehyde. Selecting hair products requires considering your hair type, porosity, and styling habits, but avoiding harmful chemicals is a good starting point. Reading ingredient labels carefully is one of the simplest yet most effective ways to protect your hair as you age.Wearing tight hairstyles that strain hair folliclesTraction alopecia is a common but preventable cause of hair loss, especially in women who regularly wear tight hairstyles. According to JAMA Dermatology, styles such as tightly braided hair, slick buns, ponytails, and heavy extensions pull on the roots, causing stress that can lead to follicle damage over time. Longer, heavier hair can also place added tension on the scalp, increasing the risk of breakage. While wearing a snug hairstyle occasionally is unlikely to cause major harm, making it a daily habit can gradually thin the hairline and weaken growth. It’s also important to avoid tying hair tightly when it’s wet, as damp strands are more elastic and prone to damage. Opting for loose, comfortable styles and using soft hair ties can help reduce unnecessary strain.Over-Brushing, rough handling, and excessive heat stylingHair care habits can make a huge difference in the health of your hair. Brushing too often or too aggressively can stretch and weaken strands, damage the scalp, and stress the follicles. The old advice of brushing hair “100 strokes a day” is outdated and can actually cause harm, especially to already thinning hair. Wet hair is particularly fragile, so detangling should always be done gently with a wide-tooth comb and minimal pulling. Rough towel drying, heavy use of hairspray, and sleeping on hair without protection can also lead to breakage. Heat styling is another major culprit; blow dryers, curling irons, and flat irons can cause dryness, split ends, and brittleness. While heat tools don’t make hair fall out at the root, they can shorten the lifespan of each strand, making thinning more noticeable. Using a heat protectant, lowering temperature settings, and limiting heat use are essential for maintaining hair health.Ignoring nutrition and key vitamins for hair healthDiet plays a critical role in the strength and growth of hair. Even if hair loss is caused by other factors, nutritional deficiencies can worsen the problem. According to a study published in NIH, hair growth depends on key nutrients such as biotin and vitamins A, C, D, and E, as well as protein, omega-3 fatty acids, zinc, iron, and magnesium. Low levels of these nutrients can lead to dull, brittle, or thinning hair. As people age, appetite changes, digestive issues, or restrictive diets may make it harder to meet nutritional needs. A balanced, mostly plant-based diet rich in whole foods, leafy greens, nuts, seeds, legumes, and healthy fats can support healthy hair growth. Supplements can be helpful when deficiencies are present, but they should be taken under professional guidance to ensure safety and effectiveness.Underestimating the impact of stressChronic stress affects nearly every aspect of health, and hair is no exception. Prolonged stress can disrupt the hair growth cycle, leading to excessive shedding or slower regrowth. This is often seen in conditions like telogen effluvium, where stress pushes hair follicles into a resting phase, causing sudden thinning. While it’s impossible to avoid all stress, managing it effectively can protect your overall well-being and your hair.Activities such as daily exercise, meditation, yoga, prayer, deep breathing exercises, or even hobbies that promote relaxation can help lower stress levels. Some people find stress relief in less conventional methods, like face massages or “floor time,” where you simply lie down and decompress. The key is consistency; making stress management a regular habit can benefit both your mind and your hair.While aging naturally changes the texture and volume of hair, many women unknowingly speed up hair loss through avoidable habits. By choosing gentle, chemical-free hair products, avoiding tight hairstyles, handling hair with care, prioritizing good nutrition, and managing stress, it’s possible to maintain healthier, fuller hair for longer. Though not all causes of hair loss can be reversed, making these adjustments can greatly improve hair strength and help preserve what you have.Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

The production of melatonin hormone which helps control sleep patterns and fights cancer, becomes disrupted when people experience sleep problems. Research shows that inadequate sleep duration or poor sleep quality, increases the likelihood of developing several types of cancer.  Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the world. While genes and environment do play a role in Cancer diagnosis, there are other hidden factors that can lead to Cancer, even if you are otherwise low risk. 29-year-old Monika Choudhary was textbook healthy, till Cancer brutally came as a jolt. In an IG post, the entrepreneur revealed how things changed, and she lost focus on her health at some point consumed by stress, that she believes eventually led to her Cancer diagnosis. (image is representational)Work pressure, deadlinesIn her post, Monika said, "I’ve always been a focused person, especially when it comes to my health. I used to eat healthy and take good care of my diet. I never liked fried or oily food. When I started working on my own website, I didn’t realise how demanding and all-consuming it would become. The long working hours, screen time, constant deadlines, and stress slowly started to take a toll on me — mentally and physically.Cancer is curable if detected early: Signs to pay attention toMy days became sedentary. I wasn’t moving much, I barely stepped outside, and I completely lost touch with my physical routine."Huge shiftShe added, "This was a huge shift from the lifestyle I had before — I used to be extremely active. Evening runs were a part of my everyday routine. They were my escape, my therapy. As I got more immersed in work, I kept pushing my health to the side. I told myself I’d get back to it “soon” — but that “soon” never came."PollWhich factor do you believe poses the greatest risk for developing cancer?Chronic stress and overworkingPoor sleep and lifestyle habitsBody started giving signsMonika added that soon her body started giving signs. She said, "Slowly, my body started giving signs — fatigue, uneasiness, discomfort — but I dismissed them, blaming it all on work pressure or a lack of sleep."The rude joltMonika's life turned around when she was diagnosed with cancer. In her own words, "Then came the diagnosis: Stage-4 colorectal cancer. A shocking moment that changed everything. Looking back now, I realise this wasn’t just about bad luck. It was a result of stress, burnout, and complete physical neglect over time. I learned, in the hardest way possible, that no ambition is worth compromising your health. Our body always keeps the score — and it eventually demands attention, one way or another."How poor lifestyle conditions lead to CancerEven though no single risk factor leads to cancer, but stress, overworking, and lack of sleep affect the immune system and increases inflammation, and impairs hormone regulation. Let's see how...StressChronic stress produces effects beyond anxiety and overwhelming feelings. Prolonged stress exposure, leads the body to produce cortisol and adrenaline (stress hormones). The immune system struggles to detect abnormal cells, while chronic inflammation occurs as a result. The release of stress hormones results in DNA destruction, alongside disruptions to essential proteins, which combat cancer cell development. Chronic stress acts as an environment for cancer cells to proliferate, while facilitating their spread throughout the body.OverworkingPeople who work excessively, along with insufficient rest periods face an elevated danger of cancer development. The connection between extensive work hours and unhealthy behaviors, leads to poor diet choices and diminished exercise levels, along with elevated smoking and drinking habits which are established cancer risk factors. Scientific research indicates that work-related stress, and long working hours possibly lead to higher breast, lung and colorectal cancer rates, though this can vary.Insufficient sleepThe body requires sleep to heal itself, and protect its immune system from damage. The production of melatonin hormone which helps control sleep patterns and fights cancer, becomes disrupted when people experience sleep problems. Research shows that inadequate sleep duration or poor sleep quality, increases the likelihood of developing several types of cancer. The lack of sleep causes damaged DNA alongside weakened immunity, increased inflammation and disrupted circadian rhythms, which all work together to help cancer cells develop.SourcesInterplay between stress and cancer—A focus on inflammation - PMCWork stress and the risk of cancer: A meta-analysisLack of Sleep Linked to Increased Risk of Cancer - Cancer Therapy AdvisorChronic Stress Promotes Cancer Development - PMCLong working hours and cancer risk: a multi-cohort study - PMCSleep quality and risk of cancer: findings from the English cohort - PMCDoes Sleep Affect Cancer Risk? | American Cancer SocietyCancer and Sleep - Sleep FoundationStress and Cancer - NCIThe Link Between Stressful Jobs & Cancer | Early DetectionDisclaimer: This article is informational only and not a substitute for medical adviceAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Liver damage warning signs: Constant itching on hands and feet could be serious
Unexplained itching on hands and feet could signal liver issues. Doctors say, this itching, especially on palms and soles, might be due to bile acid buildup. Liver disorders like cholestasis or cirrhosis are often linked. Watch for night-time itching, fatigue, or jaundice. Consult a doctor if symptoms persist. Simple steps can help soothe the itch.

Doctors say, this itching, especially on palms and soles, might be due to bile acid buildup. Liver disorders like cholestasis or cirrhosis are often linked. Watch for night-time itching, fatigue, or jaundice. Consult a doctor if symptoms persist. Simple steps can help soothe the itch.  Itchy hands and feet are commonly mistaken for dry skin, allergies, or minor irritations. However, when the itching is persistent, unexplained, and occurs without a visible rash, it could signal an underlying liver problem. Medical experts highlight that such itching, especially when concentrated on the palms and soles, may result from a buildup of bile acids in the bloodstream due to impaired liver function. This condition is often associated with disorders like cholestasis or liver cirrhosis. If the itching worsens at night, doesn’t respond to moisturisers, or is accompanied by fatigue or jaundice, it’s essential to consult a doctor promptly.Why liver damage can cause itching on hands and feetWhen the liver is not functioning properly, bile acids and toxins can build up in the bloodstream. These substances may then irritate nerve endings under the skin, leading to an intense, persistent itch, especially on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.This condition is known as cholestatic pruritus, and it often occurs without a visible rash, making it harder to diagnose. It is commonly linked to liver disorders such as:Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)CirrhosisIntrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP)Unknown Myths About Liver Disease BustedCauses of itching in liver disease:Scientists have not yet pinpointed a single cause behind the itching (pruritus) associated with liver disease. According to Healthline, it is believed to result from a combination of factors, which may include:1. Bile saltsIn liver disease, bile salts can accumulate beneath the skin, potentially triggering itching. However, this link isn’t consistent, some individuals with high bile salt levels don’t experience itching, while others itch despite normal levels.2. HistaminesMany people with liver-related itching have elevated histamine levels, although antihistamines are often ineffective in providing relief.3. SerotoninSerotonin may influence how the brain perceives itching, though its exact role remains unclear.4. Pregnancy and hormone therapyItching can worsen during pregnancy or while undergoing hormone replacement therapy, likely due to hormonal fluctuations.5. Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP)Elevated ALP levels are frequently seen in individuals experiencing itch-related liver conditions, suggesting a possible connection.Key symptoms to watch forIt’s important to differentiate everyday skin irritation from liver-related itching. Below are signs that your itching may be a warning from your liver:Itching without a rashMost skin conditions cause itching accompanied by redness, bumps, or inflammation. In contrast, liver-related itching is intense yet rash-free, affecting deep layers under the skin.It worsens at nightLiver-related itching typically becomes more severe in the evening or during sleep. Night-time itching can severely affect your quality of life and disrupt rest.It starts on hands and feetItchiness often begins in the palms and soles before spreading. These areas are sensitive to bile salt accumulation, a hallmark of liver dysfunction.Associated liver symptomsOther signs of liver problems may include:FatigueYellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice)Dark urinePale stoolsUnexplained weight lossWhen to consult a doctorYou should seek medical advice if:Itching is persistent, unexplained, or resistant to moisturisersYou notice signs of jaundice or chronic fatigueThe itching is disrupting your sleep or daily lifeA healthcare provider may order liver function tests, including bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and ultrasound scans to investigate further.Tips to prevent itching and protect your skinAvoid scratching, even when the urge is strong, as it can break the skin and increase the risk of infection. If nighttime itching is a problem, consider wearing gloves to bed to prevent unconscious scratching.Here are additional ways to soothe itching and reduce skin irritation:Bathe or shower with warm or cool water, never hot.Limit time spent in hot environments or direct sunlight.Use mild, fragrance-free soaps to avoid further irritation.Apply gentle, unscented moisturisers regularly to keep skin hydrated.Use a cold, damp cloth on itchy areas to ease discomfort.Stay away from substances or materials that irritate your skin.Wear gloves when handling harsh cleaning products or chemicals.Opt for loose, breathable clothing to prevent chafing.Use a humidifier in dry weather, especially during winter.Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not substitute professional medical advice.
