The exact reason for Akash Deep's absence remains undisclosed, though it may be related to potential fitness concerns following the demanding Test series against England. During that series, Akash Deep had delivered a memorable performance at Edgbaston, securing a 10-wicket haul that proved crucial in India's victory. However, his form appeared to decline in subsequent matches, where he managed to take only three wickets.
