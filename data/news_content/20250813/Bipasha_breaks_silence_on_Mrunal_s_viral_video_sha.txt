Netizens criticized Mrunal's comments, deeming them hypocritical given her stance on body positivity. Bipasha responded with a cryptic message emphasizing the importance of strong women supporting each other and embracing physical strength.  While Mrunal Thakur has been in the news for her dating rumours with Dhanush, the 'Super 30' actress has also been spoken about due to her viral video. This throwback video is from her television days when she was doing 'Kumkum Bhagya'. In this interview with her co-star Arjit Taneja where they talk about fitness. In this interview, as Arijit talks about the kind of women he likes, Mrunal tells him, "What you like manly women or what with muscles." She further tells him, "Go marry Bipasha," further adding that, "I'm much better than Bipasha." As this video went viral, netizens didn't take it well and slammed Mrunal. Bipasha has now broken silence on this viral video. While her note is cryptic, it is very obvious that this is Bipasha's reaction. The 'Dhoom 2' actress took to her Instagram stories and wrote,â€œStrong women lift each other up. Get those muscles beautiful ladiesâ€¦ we should be strongâ€¦ muscles help you attain good physical and mental health forever! Bust the age old thought process that women should not look strong or be physically strong!"The internet criticised Mrunal for this video. People called Bipasha Basu an icon and added that she also has a song named after her. A user said, "When she said manly with muscles I imagined a steroided up body builder, How is bipasha manly at all?" Another one added, "2 minutes of silence for her confidence ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚" A person commented, "' i will change beauty standards ' said by a woman who herself is bodyshaming a woman..ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤¯" As Mrunal got unanimously slammed online for talking about body positivity and then shading another woman. Meanwhile, amidst the backlash faced by Mrunal, she dropped some photos on Instagram with the caption, "Stop staring".
