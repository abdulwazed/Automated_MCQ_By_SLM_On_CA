Tamil Nadu governor RN Ravi (file photo) NEW DELHI: Accusing governor RN Ravi of “anti-Tamil Nadu activities,” the state unit of the Congress on Wednesday announced it will boycott his Independence Day tea party on August 15.Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) president K Selvaperunthagai said the decision was also in protest against the Election Commission’s ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the voters’ list in poll-bound Bihar.“We strongly condemn the governor’s refusal to assent to the bill passed by the state assembly to establish a university in Kumbakonam named after former chief minister M Karunanidhi. Instead of approving it, he chose to send it to the president,” Selvaperunthagai said in a statement.He recalled that the Congress had skipped Ravi’s tea party in 2024 as well, accusing him of repeatedly obstructing the functioning of the DMK-led state government. The DMK is an ally of the Congress.PollDo you support the Congress's decision to boycott the governor's Independence Day tea party?Yes, I support itNo, I do not support it The TNCC chief further alleged the governor’s recent actions had “once again undermined the will of the assembly and the people.”The boycott comes amid ongoing friction between Ravi and the DMK and its allies, who have accused him of overstepping his constitutional role. His refusal to approve key bills, delays in granting assent to legislation, and perceived political overreach have been recurring flashpoints in state politics. The tea party, held on Independence Day evening, is typically attended by ministers, legislators, senior officials, and members of the judiciary. The Congress’s absence—possibly alongside other parties—will be a pointed political statement, underscoring the widening rift between Raj Bhavan and a section of Tamil Nadu’s political establishment. The state is scheduled to hold assembly elections in mid-2026.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
