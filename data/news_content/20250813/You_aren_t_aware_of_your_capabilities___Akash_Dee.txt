India's Akash Deep celebrates after scoring fifty runs (AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) Indian pacer Akash Deep describes his first tour of England as smoother than he had imagined, thanks to a coach who believed in him, a supportive captain, and conditions that felt familiar rather than challenging. He shared his thoughts in an interview with PTI. His maiden tour saw him claim a 10-wicket haul in one Test and play a crucial 66 at the Oval in another, both contributing to India’s wins. Reflecting on the performance, Akash recalled what head coach Gautam Gambhir told him after his innings at the Oval. “You aren’t aware of your capabilities. I was telling you, you can do it. You have to play with this dedication always,” the 29-year-old shared.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Akash spoke highly of Gambhir’s support, saying the coach believes in him more than he believes in himself, both with the ball and the bat. Adjusting to new leadership has been easy for Akash, who made his Test debut under Rohit Sharma and now plays under Shubman Gill. He praised the calmness and on-field intelligence of the new captain. Playing in England, Akash Deep found the conditions surprisingly familiar. Most matches had little seam or swing movement, which required him to adjust lengths similar to sub-continental wickets. He emphasised that experience and proper practice allowed him to adapt quickly.Gautam Gambhir's fiery press conferences: Every time the India head coach lost his cool The Bengal pacer also highlighted his net routines and visualisation techniques, focusing on key opposition batters even while bowling to teammates during practice sessions. On concerns about injuries after missing games in Australia and England, he stated that impact injuries are unavoidable on the field but training injuries are minimised as much as possible. Akash has played 10 Tests, taking 28 wickets. He said selectors have not restricted him to a particular format and that he focuses on being ready for any call-up.PollWhich achievement of Akash Deep do you think stands out the most?10-wicket haul in a Test66 runs at the OvalBefore the England tour, his sister Akhanda Jyoti was diagnosed with cancer, which was an emotionally challenging time for the family. He recalled how good performances lifted her spirits and helped the family stay positive. After returning to India, Akash treated himself to his dream luxury SUV. Reflecting on his journey from playing tennis-ball cricket in Durgapur to becoming an international star, he said he has always focused on improving daily and living in the present. “The heart of my life is cricket.
