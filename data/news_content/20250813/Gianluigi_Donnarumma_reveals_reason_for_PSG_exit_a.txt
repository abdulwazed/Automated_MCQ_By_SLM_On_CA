His omission came hours after PSG named new signing Lucas Chevalier, along with Matvei Safonov and Renato Marin, in their goalkeeping lineup. Chevalier’s arrival from Lille for over €40 million had already hinted at a change in the No. 1 role.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

However, this is the life of a top-level footballer, and I am 100% responsible for this difficult decision. If it were easy, anyone would do it. These decisions have to do with the profile of the goalkeeper my team needs,” he said. It is likely that Chevalier’s passing ability from the back was a decisive factor.Gianluigi Donnarumma on Instagram (Screengrab) Donnarumma’s agent, Enzo Raiola, strongly criticised PSG’s handling of the situation. “I understand the need to buy a new goalkeeper, but dismissing Gigio after everything he's done for the club is a huge lack of respect that I will assess with my lawyers. Beyond the fact that it was the coach who made this decision, he also works for the club, and my lawyers and I want to better understand their position,” Raiola told Sky Italy. PSG skipper Marquinhos admitted he would be unhappy to see the 26-year-old leave. PollShould Gianluigi Donnarumma have been dropped from PSG's squad?Yes, it's time for a change.No, he deserves to stay. Donnarumma joined PSG in 2021 after helping Italy win the UEFA Euro Championship, taking over the No. 1 spot from Keylor Navas. Now, just as Navas once did, he finds himself on the way out as a new signing steps in.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
