Celebration of Tricolor in MDU: Rohtak immersed in the wave of patriotism, Union minister Manohar Lal administered the oath of de-addiction! ROHTAK: The campus of Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU) was painted in the colors of patriotism today, where the grand Tiranga Yatra gathered a huge crowd. This event was not only a part of the Amrit Mahotsav of Independence, but also became a strong medium to awaken the spirit of patriotism, de-addiction and environmental protection among the youth. Thousands of students, teachers, citizens and dignitaries took to the streets holding the tricolor in their hands, and the entire atmosphere resonated with the slogans of 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' and 'Vande Mataram'.Union Minister Manohar Lal inaugurated the yatra from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Cricket Stadium of MDU. On this occasion, MDU Vice Chancellor Prof. Rajbir Singh, Chairperson, Rehabilitation Council of India Dr. Sharanjit Kaur, Registrar Dr. Krishan Kant, eminent doctor Dr. Aditya Batra, industrialist Rajesh Jain and many other special guests were present. Union Minister Manohar Lal said in his motivational address that the tricolor is not just a flag, but a symbol of the country's honor and pride. During the freedom struggle, lakhs of revolutionaries sacrificed their lives for its honor. He appealed to the youth to play an active role in national interest, protect the dignity of the tricolor and connect with social concerns. The minister stressed that the young generation should awaken the spirit of patriotism, so that India can become a strong and developed nation.Appreciating MDU's 'Nasha Mukt Ghar' campaign, the minister called it an important link in the nationwide drug de-addiction movement. He administered the oath of de-addiction to all the people present and said that drug addiction is hollowing out the roots of society. Apart from this, the minister gave the message of environmental protection by planting saplings in the stadium premises, which proved to be a meaningful step against climate change. By joining this campaign, the youth will not only keep themselves healthy, but will also contribute in making the society drug-free.VC Prof. Rajbir Singh, who was presiding over the program, expressed his commitment to turn the drug-free campaign into a mega campaign. He said that today there is a dire need for freedom from drugs. More than 2.50 lakh students, teachers and staff members of MDU and its affiliated 250 colleges will unite in this campaign and work towards making Haryana drug-free. The Vice Chancellor pledged to remain dedicated to this goal throughout his life, which became a big source of inspiration for the youth.Dr. Sharanjit Kaur called upon the youth to preserve the cultural heritage of the country, increase social harmony and adopt the spirit of service. He said that such events bring positive change in the society. The Tiranga Yatra passed through the university campus and reached the Shaheed Smarak at Gate No. 1, where Minister Manohar Lal paid floral tribute to the immortal martyrs. After this, the yatra reached the Jat College playground, where it concluded with patriotic songs, slogans and cultural programs. The enthusiasm of the youth was worth seeing, who not only consider the tricolor as the pride of the past but also the responsibility of the future.Thousands of people including MDU students, NSS and YRC volunteers, NCC cadets, players, campus school students, members of social organizations, BJP District President Ranbir Dhaka, President, Jat Education Society Rohtak Gulab Singh Dimana participated in this event. This Tiranga Yatra will become a source of inspiration for the coming generations and will strengthen the participation of youth in nation building.
