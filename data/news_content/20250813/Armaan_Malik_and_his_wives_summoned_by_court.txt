Davinder Rajput claims Armaan married four times, violating Hindu law, and Payal insulted religious beliefs by dressing as a Hindu goddess.  YouTuber and Bigg Boss OTT 3 contestant Armaan Malik, along with his two wives, Payal and Kritika Malik, is facing legal heat after a Patiala district court issued summons in two separate cases. The legal action stems from a petition filed by Davinder Rajput, who has alleged that Armaan Malik is not just married twice — but four times — in violation of the Hindu Marriage Act, which allows only one marriage at a time for practising Hindus. As per a Live Hindustan report, the court has directed all three to appear on 2 September.The petition also accuses Armaan and Payal of hurting religious sentiments. It points to a video in which Payal dressed as Hindu goddess Kali, an act the complainant claims insulted religious beliefs and is punishable under Indian law.PollDo you believe reality TV shows should include contestants with unconventional family dynamics?Yes, diversity is importantNo, it complicates the narrativeAmid the backlash, Armaan and Payal Malik made public attempts at atonement. On 22 July, they visited Patiala’s Kali Mata Temple to offer prayers and apologise. The next day, on 23 July, they went to another Kali temple in Kharar, Mohali, where Payal reportedly undertook a seven-day religious penance, which involved cleaning the temple premises and performing rituals.Their reconciliation efforts didn’t stop there. The couple later travelled to Haridwar to seek forgiveness from Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Kailashanand Giri of the Niranjani Akhara. During this period, Payal’s health reportedly worsened, leading to her hospitalisation in Mohali.Armaan Malik, whose real name is Sandeep, hails from Hisar, Haryana. Before entering the social media limelight, he worked at a private bank in Delhi. His unconventional family life came into national focus when he entered Bigg Boss OTT 3 on 21 June 2024 with both wives, a move that has kept the trio firmly in the headlines ever since.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
