NEW DELHI: BJP on Wednesday hit back at Congress over its ‘vote chori’ allegation, claiming Sonia Gandhi’s name appeared on the electoral rolls in 1980, three years before she became an Indian citizen in 1983. BJP IT Cell chief Amit Malviya wrote on X, “Sonia Gandhi’s tryst with India’s voters’ list is riddled with glaring violations of electoral law. This perhaps explains Rahul Gandhi’s fondness for regularising ineligible and illegal voters, and his opposition to the SIR.”Also read: Congress launches campaign against 'vote chori'; urges citizens to register According to Malviya, Sonia Gandhi’s name was added during the 1980 revision of the New Delhi parliamentary constituency rolls, with January 1 as the qualifying date. At the time, she still held Italian citizenship and lived with the Gandhi family at 1, Safdarjung Road, the official residence of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Malviya claimed.PollShould voter registration laws be more strictly enforced in India?Yes, absolutelyNo, current laws are sufficient Malviya said she was listed at serial number 388 in polling station 145, alongside Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Sanjay Gandhi and Maneka Gandhi. “This entry was a clear violation of the law, which mandates Indian citizenship for voter registration,” he alleged.Her name was deleted in 1982 after objections, but reappeared in 1983. Malviya also questioned why she waited 15 years after marrying Rajiv Gandhi to accept Indian citizenship. “If this isn’t blatant electoral malpractice, what is?” he said, sharing a copy of the 1980 rolls.BJP further hit back at Congress over its ‘vote chori’ allegation, counter-accusing it of committing fraud in seats it had won. Responding to Rahul Gandhi’s charge of voter fraud, BJP MP and Union minister Anurag Thakur, in a press conference, presented what he called “proof” of discrepancies in Congress-held constituencies and questioned why the party ignored them. Quoting in Hindi, Thakur said, “The dust was on your face, yet you kept cleaning the mirror,” suggesting that Congress was avoiding self-reflection. He further alleged the "trend" went back to 1952, when the party joined hands with the CPI to defeat B.R. Ambedkar. “Indira Gandhi once said voters are a bunch of fools. When Rajiv Gandhi lost, he blamed the ballot paper. His son Rahul’s father pushed for voting machines, but now Rahul demands a return to ballot papers,” Thakur said.The minister also said that the opposition was making false allegations, sensing the defeat in upcoming Bihar polls.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
