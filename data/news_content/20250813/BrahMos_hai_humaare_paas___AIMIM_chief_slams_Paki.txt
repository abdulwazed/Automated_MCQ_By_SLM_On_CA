You threatened to stop our water. If you attempt such a move, Pakistan will teach you a lesson you will never forget.” He stressed that water was a lifeline for Pakistan and no compromise would be made on the country’s rights under international agreements.Reacting to these comments, Owaisi said, “BrahMos hai humaare paas” (We have BrahMos missile).PollIn your view, should India respond politically or militarily to Pakistan's threats? Politically Militarily"He should not talk such nonsense... Such threats will have no effect on India. Enough is enough," he added, as quoted by ANI.The AIMIM MP on Tuesday also hit out at Pakistan Army chief and newly promoted field marshal General Asim Munir, calling him a “sadakchaap aadmi” (roadside goon) for issuing a nuclear threat to India. Owaisi told ANI, “Pakistan Army chief’s words and his threats are condemnable. What’s unfortunate is that this is happening from the US, which is India’s strategic partner. He is speaking like a ‘sadakchaap aadmi’. We believe the Modi government should give a political response like the MEA statement.”Following the Pahalgam terrorist attack in April, which killed 26 people, India placed the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably ended its support for cross-border terrorism.The treaty, signed in 1960 after nine years of negotiations between India and Pakistan with the assistance of the World Bank, allocates the Western Rivers- Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab- to Pakistan and the Eastern Rivers- Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej- to India. Each country is permitted certain uses of the rivers allocated to the other. Under the agreement, India gets 20 per cent of the water from the Indus River system and Pakistan 80 per cent.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
