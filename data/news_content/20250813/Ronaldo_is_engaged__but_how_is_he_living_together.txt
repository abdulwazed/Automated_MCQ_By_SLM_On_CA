Saudi Arabia prohibits unmarried couples from cohabiting, but recent leniency for foreigners and tourists signals cautious legal evolution/ Image: Instagram Cristiano Ronaldo’s recent engagement to Georgina Rodríguez has drawn renewed attention to Saudi Arabia’s strict cohabitation laws. Despite longstanding legal prohibitions against unmarried couples living together, the football star and his partner have openly shared a home in Riyadh. As Ronaldo now signals a lifelong commitment to the Kingdom, his case highlights how Saudi law is evolving for foreigners, and where the lines still remain firmly drawn.Ronaldo’s engagement and his long-term commitment to Saudi Arabia Cristiano Ronaldo and Georgina Rodríguez are now officially engaged, marking a new chapter in a relationship that began in Madrid nearly a decade ago. Rodríguez confirmed the news with a photo of a large ring and a caption in Spanish: “Yes I do. In this and in all my lives.”Ronaldo’s Surprise Play: CR7 Pops the Question With Massive Diamond Ring, Georgina Says ‘Yes’The couple first met in 2016 at a Gucci store in Madrid, where Rodríguez was working as a sales assistant and Ronaldo was playing for Real Madrid. Their connection, as Rodríguez has described in past interviews, was “love at first sight.” The relationship quickly deepened, and the pair have since built a life together that spans continents, clubs, and now countries.Though they have not publicly announced a wedding date, Ronaldo has referred to Rodríguez as his wife on multiple occasions. At the 2024 Globe Soccer Awards in Dubai, he said during his acceptance speech:“It’s a big pleasure to win this trophy. My oldest son is here, my wife is here.”Today, they are raising five children together, daughters Bella and Alana, as well as Ronaldo’s older children Cristiano Jr., Eva, and Mateo. Their life together is currently based in Riyadh, where Ronaldo plays for Saudi Pro League club Al-Nassr. In July 2025, he made his most definitive statement yet about his future, saying in a video released by Al-Nassr:“My family always supports my decisions, and we’re happy here in Saudi Arabia... That’s why we want to live here and build our lives here.”At 40, Ronaldo revealed that while his current contract extends for two more years as a footballer, his connection to the Kingdom goes far beyond the sport.“I will stay twomore years as a football player, but also for life because my contribution to this country is not only for football... I want to be part of the country’s growth forever.” He described Saudi Arabia as a land of “peace and safety”, adding that he and his family feel deeply welcomed by the local people and culture. “We don’t need to prove anything to anyone,” he said. “I love the culture. I’d just say: come and see it for yourself.”Living together before marriage, a legal grey zoneUntil recently, it would have been legally impossible for Ronaldo and Rodríguez to cohabit in Saudi Arabia. The country’s legal system, rooted in Islamic Sharia law, formally prohibits couples from living together outside of marriage. These rules are generally upheld through legal, social, and cultural norms. Yet, since Ronaldo’s arrival in late 2022, following his high-profile departure from Manchester United, he and Rodríguez have openly lived as a family in Riyadh without facing any penalties. This arrangement raised immediate questions, especially among those familiar with the Kingdom’s legal environment. According to the Spanish news agency EFE, local authorities made an unofficial exception in Ronaldo’s case. Two Saudi lawyers told EFE that while the law technically remains in place, it is no longer consistently enforced for foreign nationals:“Although the laws still prohibit cohabitation without a marriage contract, the authorities have begun to turn a blind eye and do not persecute anyone. Of course, these laws are used when there is a problem or a crime,” one lawyer said.Another legal expert added:“The Saudi Arabian authorities, today, do not interfere in this matter [in the case of foreigners], but the law continues to prohibit cohabitation outside of marriage.” These remarks make clear that Ronaldo’s high status and visibility have likely afforded him a degree of leniency not available to most. Beyond his $700 million Al-Nassr contract and equity stake, the fact that he and Rodríguez are raising five children together and already committed, waiting only for the “perfect click” to formalize their engagement, reflects how their near-married family life must have influenced the Kingdom’s to grant them unofficial leniency.What the law says, and who it applies toSaudi Arabia’s cohabitation laws, rooted in Islamic teachings, consider marriage the only sanctioned structure for romantic relationships and shared domestic life. Cohabitation outside of marriage, though not always explicitly codified, is treated as a criminal offense under the broader legal framework. For most residents and foreign workers, living together as an unmarried couple can result in severe penalties, including:  Fines: Depending on circumstances, financial penalties can be significant.   Detention: Individuals may be detained during investigations.  Deportation: Foreign nationals found violating cohabitation laws are often deported and banned from returning.   Legal Prosecution: Charges may lead to trial, especially if compounded by other legal breaches.   Professional Consequences: Employers can terminate contracts or revoke sponsorships.   Saudi society also places high value on moral conduct, family honor, and public modesty, reinforcing these legal expectations culturally.New law allows hotel stays for unmarried foreign tourists While domestic laws remain strict, Saudi Arabia has recently introduced specific legal relaxations for foreign visitors, particularly around hotel stays. In a bid to grow its tourism sector, the Kingdom now allows unmarried foreign couples to share hotel rooms without providing proof of marriage. This change applies only to foreign nationals. Saudi citizens are still required to present legal documentation of marriage if they wish to stay together in a hotel. The new regulation represents a calculated step toward accommodating international norms while preserving domestic standards. Importantly, this hotel exemption does not extend to private residences or long-term cohabitation. Foreign residents who live and work in Saudi Arabia are still generally expected to follow the country’s broader legal framework, unless, as in Ronaldo’s case, unofficial leniency is granted.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
