Visitors to Kuwait can now enter by air, land, or sea using any airline or transport carrier, removing previous restrictions/ Representative image Kuwait has officially removed the salary requirement for expatriates applying for family visit visas, in a significant shift aimed at easing entry for extended family members. The move, confirmed by top interior ministry officials, forms part of a wider effort to make Kuwait more accessible to visitors and to strengthen social ties among residents. Just a day earlier, Kuwait had also introduced visa-on-arrival privileges for foreign residents of GCC countries, underscoring the country’s broader regional integration goals.TL;DR  Kuwait removes minimum salary requirement for family visit visas.   Extended family up to fourth degree now eligible for visits.   Visa applications processed online in as little as five minutes.   Visitors can arrive via any airline or transport mode.Salary barrier removed, all expats can now invite extended family In a major policy overhaul, Kuwait has eliminated the minimum income requirement for expatriates seeking to bring family members on visit visas. Acting Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Sheikh Fahad Al-Yousef Al-Sabah authoriz ed the change, which is now officially in effect. Under the updated rules:  All expatriates residing legally in Kuwait can apply for family visit visas, regardless of their salary level.   The new eligibility extends to relatives up to the fourth degree by blood, and third-degree in-laws by marriage, significantly expanding the previously limited scope which covered only spouses, parents, and children.   Colonel Abdulaziz Al Kandari of the General Residency Department’s Electronic Services Administration confirmed that the shift aims to support family cohesion and remove bureaucratic hurdles for residents. “Any legal resident in Kuwait can now apply to host visiting family members, regardless of income,” he said, adding that applications are available through the newly launched Kuwait Visa platform and mobile app, with most complete applications processed in just five minutes. The family visit visa is valid for one month, with the option to arrive via air, land, or sea, using any carrier. This marks another major update, as visitors are no longer required to travel exclusively with Kuwaiti airlines such as Kuwait Airways or Al-Jazeera Airways.A unified platform offering four visa categories The visa reforms are part of the government's broader plan to modernize and digitize the immigration process. The Kuwait Visa platform, available via website and mobile application, now issues four distinct types of visas:  Tourist Visa   Family Visit Visa   Business Visa   Governmental Visa   Each category serves specific needs, with streamlined online procedures for faster processing. The business visa, for instance, allows Kuwaiti companies to invite foreign business partners, with fees varying based on nationality.Detailed breakdown of tourist visa categories Tourist visas issued via the platform are classified into four categories, each with different eligibility conditions:Category 1:  Nationals of 53 countries, mostly Western and developed nations.   Includes 41 European countries, 8 Asian countries (such as Japan, Singapore, Brunei, South Korea, Hong Kong, Laos, Cambodia, and Malaysia), and the USA, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.   Eligible individuals can obtain visas on arrival or through online application.   No additional conditions or documentation required.   Authorities still recommend applying online to avoid potential delays due to security screening.  Category 2:  Open to foreign residents of GCC countries, as well as individuals holding valid US, UK, Canadian, or Schengen visas.   No longer requires proof of profession level, as the earlier stipulation for "medium to high" profession holders has been removed.   No need for salary certificate or bank statement.  Required documents: Passport copy Personal photo Confirmed air ticket Hotel bookingVisa options:Single-entry: valid for 1, 2, or 3 months.Multiple-entry: valid for 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year (maximum stay: 1 month per entry). Category 3:  For applicants not eligible under Categories 1 or 2.   Must show proof of financial capacity through bank account statements.   Final rules are still under review.  Category 4:  For individuals attending entertainment or sports events in Kuwait.   Applications will open only during event periods.  GCC expat residents now get visa on arrival, no prior application Just a day before the family visa reforms, Kuwait introduced a separate but equally significant change: foreign residents of GCC countries can now obtain tourist visas on arrival. The decision was introduced by First Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Sheikh Fahad Al-Yousef Al-Sabah, and applies to expatriates living in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, or Kuwait, as long as their residency permit is valid for at least six months. Unlike before, there are no restrictions based on nationality, and travelers no longer need to apply in advance or go through embassies. The visa is issued directly at any entry point, by land, sea, or air, making travel to Kuwait much easier for non-GCC nationals living in the region. This move replaces older, more restrictive policies and is part of a wider shift across the Gulf to open up travel for residents. It also supports Kuwait’s efforts to grow its tourism sector, which is expected to generate over $1.13 billion by 2025 through increased regional mobility and visitor numbers.FAQs:Q.
