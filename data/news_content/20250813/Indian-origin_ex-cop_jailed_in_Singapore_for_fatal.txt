The case relates to the death of Piang Ngaih Don, a domestic worker from Myanmar, who died on July 26, 2016, from brain injuries caused by repeated blunt trauma. At the time of her death, she was severely malnourished, weighing just 24 kilograms.'Nothing Comes Free, Won't Stop...': Singapore PM's Big Announcement At Military EventAccording to Channel News Asia, Chelvam, who was Don’s legal employer, allowed her to be abused over several months by his ex-wife, Gaiyathiri Murugayan, and his mother-in-law, Prema S Narayanasamy. Murugayan and Narayanasamy are already serving 30-year and 17-year sentences, respectively, for their roles in the abuse.PollShould there be stricter laws against domestic abuse?Yes, absolutelyNo, current laws are enoughDistrict Judge Teoh Ai Lin noted Chelvam’s failure to intervene or protect Don, despite witnessing her deteriorating condition. He also removed the home’s CCTV recorder to conceal evidence and lied to investigators.Prosecutor Sean Teh said video footage showed Chelvam present during several episodes of abuse and accused him of supporting the starvation that contributed to Don’s death.Chelvam was acquitted on a fifth charge of using criminal force.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
