For Sheila Isaacs, it meant gearing up, literally. Now 87, Sheila has been competing in triathlons for over 35 years, and the one activity that has stolen her heart is cycling. It’s more than just exercise for her, it’s joy, freedom, and the key to staying strong well into her 80s.In a recent interview with Women’s Health, Sheila shared how her love for cycling has evolved over the years and why it continues to keep her fit. But what exactly makes cycling such a powerful tool for healthy ageing? 2/6Cycling through the yearsSheila’s relationship with cycling has changed with age. In her 80s, tall racing bikes became harder to mount, so she switched to a shorter stationary bike indoors, still positioned by the open garage door to soak in fresh air and outdoor views.Modifying workouts with age isn’t quitting, it’s smart training. As joints become more sensitive, high-impact activities like running can strain knees and hips. Switching to a low-impact activity like cycling helps maintain cardiovascular health without overloading the joints. It’s a practical example of the saying: “Train smarter, not harder.”3/6Why cycling keeps the body youngerCycling isn’t just a leg workout. It engages the core, improves balance, and boosts cardiovascular endurance. Sheila alternates cycling days with swimming and weightlifting, which keeps her muscles challenged and prevents overuse injuries.According to studies, regular cycling helps maintain bone density, muscle mass, and coordination, all of which naturally decline with age. The steady pedalling motion also promotes better blood circulation, which supports brain function and lowers the risk of age-related cognitive decline.4/6The science of fun and longevitySheila admits that her biggest shift came when she stopped stressing over races and simply started enjoying them. To her, race day is “a swim, a bike ride, and a walk.” That mindset has kept her going for decades.​Researchers have found that people who exercise for enjoyment, not obligation, are far more likely to stick to it long-term. Fun releases dopamine and endorphins, the “happy hormones” that not only lift mood but also reduce inflammation, one of the key factors in age-related diseases.5/6Tracking progress without obsessionSheila has been logging her workouts for 30 years, time, distance, mileage, and even how she feels. This habit helps her adjust training when her joints feel sore and ensures she never pushes beyond healthy limits.Fitness tracking isn’t about chasing numbers; it’s about listening to the body. Studies show that self-monitoring increases awareness of physical limits, which lowers the risk of injury and improves long-term adherence to exercise. It’s the difference between exercising for a few years and exercising for a lifetime.6/6The lesson in Sheila’s pedal powerSheila’s cycling story isn’t just about stamina; it’s about adaptability, joy, and community. At her 200th triathlon, she raced alongside her daughter and granddaughter. Her goal? Not winning, but finishing healthy and happy.This outlook aligns with what longevity experts often say: social connections and meaningful activities are as vital as physical fitness for a long, healthy life. Cycling has given Sheila both a reason to move and a circle of fellow athletes to share it with.[Disclaimer: This article is based on Sheila Isaacs’ personal experience as shared with Women’s Health.
