Mahavatar Narsimha, the animated mythological film, has achieved remarkable success, crossing USD 1 million in North America. Its popularity among the diaspora is evident, highlighting the appeal of Indian stories. Domestically, the film has earned Rs 168 crore, with the Hindi version surpassing Rs 100 crore, a first for an Indian animated film. Ashwin Kumar's Mahavatar Narsimha is proving to be nothing short of a box office juggernaut. The mythological animated spectacle has now crossed the coveted USD 1 million milestone in North America, cementing its place as one of the most successful Indian films overseas this year.The film had been on a steady upward trend since release, but the weekend proved to be a turning point in its overseas performance. Till Friday the film had earned about USD 585,000 and Saturday numbers were tracking between USD 250,000–300,000 collection and even on Sunday the numbers were close to USD 250,000. And with that the film has finally crossed the USD 1 million mark, an achievement that underlines its growing popularity among the diaspora.The North America market is a very mature market when it comes to animation films thanks to Hollywood films, but for a film that is rooted in Indian history goes on to show people are willing to step out if the film has a good message. Mahavatar Narsimha tells the story of Hiranyakashyap and his son Prahlad and the eternal battle of good vs evil.'Mahavatar Narsimha' Rockets to ₹37 Crore in Six Days—Animated Epic Becomes Surprise HitWhile Mahavatar Narsimha’s North American rampage is making headlines, its performance back home in India is equally — if not more — impressive. The film has already raked in Rs 168 crore domestically of which it’s Hindi version has collected over Rs 126 crore, making it the sixth biggest Hindi hit of 2025 so far. In doing so, it has achieved a historic milestone — becoming the first-ever Hindi animated film to cross the Rs 100 crore mark at the Indian box office.The film is expected to have a slow run with the onset of the weekend as majority of screens would be given to Rajinikanth’s Coolie and Hrithik Roshan, Jr.NTR and Kiara Advani’s War 2 as both films are clashing on 14th August. Between the two films the box office has earned more than USD 2.2 million dollars and is expected to be the biggest weekend for Indian films in the circuit.
