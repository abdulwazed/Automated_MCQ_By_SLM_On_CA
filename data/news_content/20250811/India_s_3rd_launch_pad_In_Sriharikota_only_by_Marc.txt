Representative image (TOI)  BENGALURU: India’s third satellite launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota is slated to be fully operational only by March 2029, according to the Department of Space. The ambitious project, seen as critical to the country's growing space programme, is progressing through key milestones following financial sanction earlier this year.The new facility, referred to as Third Launch Pad (TLP), will serve as the primary site for launching India’s upcoming Next Generation Launch Vehicle (NGLV) and act as a backup for existing heavy-lift vehicles such as LVM3, according to the Department of Space (DoS)The construction timeline includes completion of civil works by May 2028, installation of fluid systems and propellant storage by July 2028, and establishment of launch pad systems by Sept 2028, before full commissioning in March 2029.PollDo you support the development of a third satellite launch pad in India?YesNoAs per DoS, surveys and geotechnical studies were wrapped up by May this year, and tender evaluations for infrastructure works are currently underway. The project is being broken into multiple work packages, with an emphasis on partnering with Indian private players and MSMEs in line with Make in India and self-reliance goals.The need for a third pad has long been flagged by space officials, especially as Isro prepares for human spaceflight under Gaganyaan, continued Moon missions under the Chandrayaan programme, and future operations involving Indian astronauts.Former Isro chairman S Somanath had earlier told TOI that while the second launch pad has been retrofitted for LVM3 and Gaganyaan launches, the risk of a single-point failure remains. “If something happens to the second pad, all heavy launches would grind to a halt,” he had said, batting for TLP.The first launch pad, originally built for the PSLV, is incompatible with cryogenic and semi-cryogenic engines used in newer rockets. The upcoming NGLV, expected to stand 91 metres tall — more than double the height of LVM3 — will also require an entirely new infrastructure due to its significantly higher thrust, new propellant needs, and jet deflection characteristics.Rajarajan A, former director, Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) — the spaceport in Sriharikota — who took charge as director Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) on Aug 1, had earlier stressed on the importance of TLP in accommodating the size and complexity of future rockets.He had told TOI that while existing launch pads are being modified for near-term Gaganyaan missions, only a new pad can fully support India’s next-gen space goals. Once operational, the TLP is expected to become the linchpin of India’s deep space missions, including space station deployment and lunar landings.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous10 Birds with the "wildest dating rituals"LifestyleKarishma Tanna Stuns with Style and SpiritEntertainmentFrom Moong to Chia Sprouts: How to grow your breakfast in balconyLifestyleBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Here’s how much each contestant earns dailytv10 creatures that survive in the deepest parts of the oceanLifestyleRaksha Bandhan: 10 quotes that describe the beautiful bond between brothers and sistersLifestyleHow to do step-by-step Ayurveda hair therapy at homeLifestyleSamantha Ruth Prabhu turns heads in stunning saree looksEntertainmentFrom reducing cholesterol to diabetes : 10 reasons to add cinnamon to your daily dietLifestyleAffordable SUVs under Rs 15 lakh with panoramic sunroof: Tata Nexon, XUV 3XO and moreauto Next123 Photostories  5 diseases moles on your body might indicate and should not be ignoredNot-so popular drinks that help in weightloss10 places in South Africa that aren’t to be missed in a lifetimeMemorable style outings of Princess CharlotteHow Kangana Ranaut turned fame into fearless politicsFrom ₹6 Lakh to ₹40 Lakh: A peek into Kamal Haasan’s ultra-luxe watch closetFrom Archana reacting to a hate comment to son Aaryamann revealing how he impressed girlfriend Yogita Bihani: Archana Puran Singh shares candid moments6 things one should never do when cooking with gheeAugust Escape: Top Hill Stations in Sri Lanka for a Perfect Mountain GetawayYour Lucky Days According To Your Birth Date123Hot PicksGlobal Standard indexUS stocks todayIndia-US tariffIntel CEOMukesh AmbaniUS jobless dataRussia crude oilTop TrendingTom BradyDonald TrumpSouth Park EpisodeCall of DutyMalik BeasleyBattlefield 6 Beta OpensPrivate School in IndianaLuka Doncic Weight LossLinda McMahonLakers RumorsTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire Website'Film not against any religion': Kanhaiya Lal's son watches Udaipur Files with slain tailor's photo - watchEvening news wrap: India's fuel bill may rise by $12bn if it stops buying Russian oil; Centre withdraws Income Tax Bill; and more'Gathering of friendship': China welcomes PM Modi for SCO Tianjin Summit - signal thaw in tiesRahul Gandhi vs EC: Congress MP poses 5 questions day after big 'vote theft' claim; says poll body acting as BJP 'agent'India’s 3rd launch pad In Sriharikota only by March 2029'Big 'kaand' happening under EC's nose': Priyanka Gandhi slams poll body; backs Rahul's claims of voter fraud'Will miss my Hindustan': Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia bids adieu; lauds SC, lawyers in farewell addressWatch: Woman alleges denial of entry over Indian attire; restaurant apologises, Delhi CM orders probeVoter list row intensifies: ECI questions Rahul Gandhi’s ‘fake votes’ claim; cites Karnataka govt’s use of same rolls for caste census'Will advise PM Modi on how to deal with Trump': Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu; claims 'Israeli weapons used in Operation Sindoor'Elon Musk updates Mars mission timeline: Starship crewed by Optimus possible in 2026; real target now 2028–2030Jaz Agassi’s sweet support for dad Andre Agassi — Steffi Graf moment resurfacesUPPSC Staff Nurse result 2025 out at dgme.up.gov.in: Direct link to download scorecards hereWBCAP UG merit list 2025 release delayed: Check important details hereGrads and high schoolers can earn 1-2 lakhs per month through this internship opportunity: Here's howHuma Qureshi's cousin murdered: Chilling visuals from crime scene emerge; Asif was stabbed multiple times by duoHuma Qureshi’s cousin murdered in Delhi over parking dispute; 2 arrestedNavratilova: Chris Evert’s Catholic upbringing shaped her tennis imageSelena Gomez on Swift amid reported split with Blake LivelyDonald Trump Tariffs News Live Updates: India-US trade deal talks in limbo?
