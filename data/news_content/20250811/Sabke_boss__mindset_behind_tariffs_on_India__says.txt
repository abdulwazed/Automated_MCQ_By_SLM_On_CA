He alluded to tariff tensions, predicting that attempts to hinder India's progress through tariffs would fail due to the country's strong position.  RAISEN: The world sees "new India" as a strong, fast-growing economy whose ability to defeat its enemies with "homegrown strength" has become the envy of those who think "sabke boss toh hum hain", defence minister Rajnath Singh said Sunday, taking a veiled swipe at US President Donald Trump amid escalating tariff tensions."Many wonder how India is growing at such a fast pace. They are trying their best to ensure goods made in India, by Indians, are costlier than goods made in their countries," Singh said at the foundation ceremony of the Rs 1,800-crore BEML Rail Hub for Manufacturing in MP's Raisen."They feel this will ensure that when goods made in India become expensive, the world wouldn't buy them. They are putting in much effort to ensure this."Singh predicted that attempts to browbeat India with additional tariffs wouldn't succeed, given how the country had positioned itself.We don't provoke anyone, but those who provoke us won't be spared: Rajnath India is progressing so fast that I could say with full confidence - no power in the world can now stop us from becoming a big power, Rajnath Singh said.Singh said that despite the naysayers, Operation Sindoor was proof that India possessed the capabilities to show its enemies their place without depending on anybody.He termed the operation "a befitting reply to the heinous and cowardly terrorist attack in Pahalgam" and a loud and clear message that India no longer tolerates an attack on its integrity and sovereignty. "We don't provoke anyone, but those who provoke us will not be spared," he added.The defence minister said the country's armed forces effectively utilising indigenous equipment was crucial to the success of Operation Sindoor. "India was able to reach this position only because it has taken the pledge to become atmanirbhar in the defence sector."Crediting PM Narendra Modi for the transformation, Rajnath Singh said India wasn't just manufacturing defence equipment for its own use, but also catering to the security needs of friendly countries."Our defence production and export are increasing at an unprecedented pace, touching record figures. This is the new defence sector of new India."Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and MP chief minister Mohan Yadav were also at the event.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousHow to make natural hair colour using tea and coffeeLifestyleDivyanka Tripathi’s top 10 stylish must-have lookstv9 heart-healthy foods that cut attack and stroke riskLifestyleSaniya Iyappan steals the spotlight with her graceEntertainmentCarrie Coon’s secret weapon on TV?
