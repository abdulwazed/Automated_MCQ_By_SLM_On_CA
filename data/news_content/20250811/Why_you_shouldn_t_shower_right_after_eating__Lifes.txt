Why you shouldn’t shower right after eating: Lifestyle coach reveals the impact on digestion
Lifestyle coach Luke Coutinho advises against showering immediately after meals, as it diverts blood flow from the digestive system, potentially hindering nutrient absorption and causing discomfort. Waiting 90-120 minutes post-meal or showering beforehand allows for optimal digestion, especially beneficial for those with gut sensitivities. This simple adjustment can improve energy levels and overall gut health.

Waiting 90-120 minutes post-meal or showering beforehand allows for optimal digestion, especially beneficial for those with gut sensitivities. This simple adjustment can improve energy levels and overall gut health.  Many of us enjoy a relaxing shower after a meal, thinking it helps us feel refreshed but this everyday habit could be secretly harming your digestion. Lifestyle coach Luke Coutinho, in a recent Instagram post, warned that showering immediately after eating can interfere with the body’s natural digestive process. When you eat, your body increases blood flow to the stomach, activates digestive enzymes, and works to regulate temperature for optimal breakdown of food. Stepping into the shower too soon diverts this focus, which can be especially troublesome for those dealing with bloating, acid reflux, IBS, or sluggish digestion. The fix is simple: shower before meals or wait 90–120 minutes afterward to give your gut the time it needs to do its job efficiently.Why showering after meals affects digestionBlood flow diversionWhen you eat, your body prioritises sending blood to the stomach and intestines to break down food and absorb nutrients. A hot shower draws blood toward the skin’s surface to help regulate temperature, reducing the supply to your digestive system. A cold shower can cause the opposite, narrowing blood vessels and restricting circulation. In both cases, the stomach gets less support, slowing digestion and potentially causing discomfort.Greater impact on sensitive gutsPeople with existing gut health problems, such as gastritis, IBS, chronic acidity, or constipation are more likely to feel the negative effects. Disrupting digestion early can trigger bloating, heaviness, or acid reflux, making recovery from gut issues more difficult.Temperature regulation interferenceDigestion slightly increases your body’s core temperature. Sudden exposure to very hot or cold water forces your system to shift focus toward temperature control instead of digestion. Over time, this repeated interference could lead to poor nutrient absorption and inflammation.How to adjust your shower habits for better digestionTo protect your digestive health, it’s worth making a few simple changes to your shower routine. Ideally, take a shower before meals, especially before heavy lunches or dinners, so your body can focus entirely on breaking down food afterward. If showering before eating isn’t possible, wait at least 90–120 minutes after a meal. This window gives your stomach and intestines time to process food, release enzymes, and absorb nutrients without interference. Even if you don’t have gut issues, limiting post-meal showers to occasional situations is wise. Making this adjustment not only supports digestion but also helps maintain steady energy levels, reduces the risk of bloating, and promotes overall gut health in the long run.Benefits of waiting before showeringBetter nutrient absorption, uninterrupted blood flow ensures your body uses vitamins and minerals effectively.Reduced post-meal fatigue, avoiding a shower right after eating can help you feel less sluggish and more alert.Improved metabolism, a smoother digestive process supports balanced energy and weight management.How to make the habit change easyPlan your schedule so you shower in the morning before breakfast or later in the day well after meals.After workouts, cool down first and wait before eating or showering to avoid overlapping stress on digestion.Use the waiting period after meals for light activity such as walking, gentle stretching, or reading, these can actually enhance digestion.Summary table: Shower timing and digestionHabitRecommended ChangeWhy It HelpsShowering immediately after mealsWait 90–120 minutesKeeps blood flow focused on digestionLong hot showers post-mealReduce temperature or delayPrevents excessive vasodilationCold showers right after eatingDelay until digestion startsAvoids blood vessel constrictionShowering before eatingMaintain as a habitPrepares the body for smooth digestionShowering after meals may seem harmless, but as Luke Coutinho points out, it can subtly slow down your digestion and reduce gut health efficiency over time. This is especially important for people with sensitive digestive systems. By making a simple change, showering before meals or waiting at least 90–120 minutes afterward, you can support better nutrient absorption, reduce digestive discomfort, and keep your energy levels steady. Sometimes, it’s these small, mindful adjustments that deliver the biggest long-term health benefits.Also read| Childhood obesity linked to colon cancer risk: Why parents should take early weight gain seriouslyAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.
