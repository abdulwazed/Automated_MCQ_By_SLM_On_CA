Medha Patkar (File photo) NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday confirmed activist Medha Patkar's conviction in a defamation case filed by Delhi lieutenant governor VK Saxena. The top court set aside a penalty of Rs 1 lakh imposed on Medha Patkar in the case.On April 23 this year, a Delhi court issued a non-bailable warrant against activist Medha Patkar, observing that she was deliberately flouting its sentencing order to submit probation bonds and Rs 1 lakh as fine in Saxena's 2001 defamation case.Additional sessions judge Vishal Singh observed that instead of appearing before the court to comply with the sentencing of April 8, the 70-year-old social activist had remained absent and deliberately failed to comply with the order to avail of the benefit of probation subject to furnishing the compensation amount.PollIn your opinion, was the defamation notice against Medha Patkar warranted?Yes, her statements were harmful.No, it was an attack on free speech."The intention of the convict is apparent. She is deliberately violating the court order; she is avoiding appearing before the court and also avoiding accepting the terms of the sentence passed against her," the judge said on Wednesday. On April 8, the sessions court had released Patkar on "probation for good conduct" in the defamation case against Saxena, who headed an NGO in Gujarat in 2001. The sessions court modified the order of a magisterial court on July 1, 2024, sentencing her to five months of simple imprisonment. It asked her to deposit compensation of Rs 1 lakh, which was to be released to Saxena.Two days later, on April 25, Delhi Police arrested Patkar. However, the Delhi high court, the same afternoon, deferred till May 20 the sentence of Patkar.In July, the Delhi high court upheld the conviction and punishment awarded to activist Medha Patkar and noted that the trial court order, against which Patkar approached the high court, did not require any interference as the challenge was "more in the nature of hair-splitting and hinged on technicalities."The high court pointed out that in the appeal, Patkar did not even refer to the text and context of the defamatory press note that had triggered the defamation suit as it alleged Saxena was "mortgaging" the people of Gujarat and their resources to foreign interests, prompting the trial court to declare it a direct attack on his integrity and public service. "The record suggests that the essential ingredients of Section 499 of the IPC are clearly made out. The imputations made were specific, published in the public domain, and caused harm to the reputation of the respondent," the high court noted in its order, saying it found no illegality in the conclusions reached by the trial court.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
