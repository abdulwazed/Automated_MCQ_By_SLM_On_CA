Delhi Police halted the march, leading to dramatic scenes of leaders climbing barricades.  NEW DELHI: Opposition MPs from the INDIA bloc, including senior leaders Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, and Sharad Pawar, were stopped by Delhi Police on Monday as they marched from Parliament to the Election Commission headquarters. The demonstration was held against the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar and allegations of “voter fraud” during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.Parliament monsoon session live updateWearing white caps marked with a red cross over the words “SIR” and “vote chori”, the leaders raised slogans and carried placards accusing the Election Commission of collusion with the government. The march began at Parliament’s Makar Dwar with the national anthem but was halted at Transport Bhawan, where police had set up heavy barricading.Here's the latest developments:Rahul, Priyanka Gandhi detainedDelhi police detained INDIA bloc MPs, including Lok Sabha Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi and Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi, for holding the unauthorized protest.Joint Commissioner of Police Deepak Purohit told ANI, "The detained INDIA bloc leaders have been taken to a nearby Police Station. We are still counting the number of MPs detained. There was no permission for a protest here, but we had intimation."New Delhi DCP Devesh Kumar added, "There was a permission for 30 MPs from the Election Commission. Since they were in large numbers, we detained them. We will take 30 MPs (to the Election Commission of India) when we get their names."Opposition march halted by police barricadesOpposition MPs, including Leaders of Opposition Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge, attempted a march from Parliament House to the Election Commission on Monday to protest against the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar and alleged “vote chori”. The procession, which began at Parliament’s Makar Dwar after the national anthem, was halted outside the PTI building by heavy police barricading. Women MPs, including saree-clad TMC’s Mahua Moitra and Congress’ Sanjana Jatav and Jothimani, climbed the barricades to raise slogans against the EC. Many MPs sat on the road, chanting, before being whisked away in buses lined along the route. The march aimed to submit a memorandum to the EC but was stopped before reaching Nirvachan Sadan.Akhilesh Yadav scales barricades in defianceSamajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav accused authorities of using police to “stop us” from reaching the EC. Before sitting down in protest, Yadav climbed the barricades, chanting slogans against the SIR exercise. “They are using the police to stop us,” he said. His actions were mirrored by other opposition leaders, who scaled the barriers as a symbolic rejection of what they see as state overreach. Yadav has previously accused the ruling BJP of manipulating electoral processes in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, and joined other INDIA bloc leaders in demanding a transparent revision of voter rolls ahead of the Bihar assembly elections.Rahul Gandhi calls it a fight for the ConstitutionAs he was detained and taken away in a police bus, Rahul Gandhi said, “This fight is not political, but it is aimed at saving the Constitution. This fight is for ‘one man, one vote’ and we want a clean, pure voter list.” He accused the government of silencing opposition voices, adding, “They cannot talk as the truth is before the entire nation….” Gandhi also helped TMC’s Moitra and Mitali Bag after they fainted during the protest. The Congress leader has consistently alleged “vote theft” in Bihar’s electoral process, claims denied by the Election Commission and the BJP, who have challenged him to present evidence.Kharge says protest is to save democracyCongress president Mallikarjun Kharge was among those detained. He described the protest as “a fight to protect the people’s right to vote” and “a struggle to save democracy”. In a post on X, Kharge wrote, “BJP’s cowardly dictatorship will not work!” He also accused the BJP of conspiring to “shred the Constitution” through the SIR process, which the opposition claims is intended to disenfranchise voters in poll-bound Bihar ahead of assembly elections later this year. Kharge vowed that the INDIA bloc would “surely expose” what he termed as a “BJP conspiracy”, stressing that the electoral roll must remain free from manipulation.Priyanka Gandhi: ‘Government is cowardly’Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra led slogans during the march and was later detained by Delhi Police. Speaking at the protest, she said, “Dare hue hai. Sarkaar kaayar hai (They are scared. This government is cowardly).” She joined other senior leaders in accusing the EC of collusion with the government. Alongside her, several women MPs climbed barricades in defiance, including TMC’s Moitra, Sushmita Dev, and Sagarika Ghose. The protest banners read “SIR+Vote Theft=Murder of Democracy” and “SIR – Loktantra Par Vaar”. Priyanka has been vocal in Parliament against the SIR, alleging that it undermines the democratic process and erodes public trust in elections.BJP hits backUnion Minister Dharmendra Pradhan accused opposition parties of trying to “create anarchy in the country”. He dismissed Rahul Gandhi’s “vote theft” claim as a “lie” and alleged the protests were part of a “well thought out strategy to create instability”. Pradhan said, “Congress and other opposition parties want to make ‘intruders’ voters in the country.” He urged the opposition to raise the matter in Parliament rather than staging protests. “You cannot adversely impact PM Modi’s leadership, people’s decision, country’s constitutional system by creating fear in the minds of people,” he said, insisting that the EC’s process was lawful and necessary.EC restrictions spark fresh criticismAccording to opposition leaders, the EC only allowed 30 individuals to enter its office, a move criticised as undemocratic. KC Venugopal questioned, “What democracy is there in the country? MPs don’t have the freedom to go to the Election Commission.” He said police “want to stop us here” and accused the government of avoiding accountability. The EC’s stance, according to opposition MPs, undermines its role as a neutral electoral watchdog. The restriction has become another flashpoint in the INDIA bloc’s ongoing standoff with the Commission, which they accuse of enabling voter list manipulation in Bihar.Parliament deadlock over SIR continuesThe SIR dispute has paralysed Parliament since the Monsoon session began on 21 July. Opposition MPs have staged repeated walkouts and disruptions, demanding a debate on the Bihar voter roll revision and alleged electoral irregularities. Government business has been minimal, except for brief discussions on Operation Sindoor. The INDIA bloc has made the SIR its central issue, linking it to broader claims of democratic erosion under the BJP. The EC has rejected the allegations, insisting its procedures meet legal standards.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
