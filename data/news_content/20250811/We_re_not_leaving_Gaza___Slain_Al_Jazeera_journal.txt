A poignant video of al-Sharif and his daughter, expressing their unwavering love for Gaza and refusal to leave, has gone viral posthumously. Al Jazeera condemns the attack as deliberate, while the Israeli military claims al-Sharif was a Hamas operative.  An emotional video of Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif speaking tenderly with his young daughter and expressing their love for Gaza has gone viral, just hours after news broke that he was killed alongside four colleagues in an Israeli strike.The 28-year-old reporter in the clip can be seen asking his daughter if she would want to leave the embattled territory. She refuses — not for Qatar, Jordan, Egypt, or Turkey — insisting repeatedly: "I want to stay in Gaza."Gaza: Al Jazeera Staff Killed In Relentless IDF Bombardment, Journo’s Final Message Reveals HorrorSeconds before the end of the video, al-Sharif asks her to tell the world their message. She looks into the camera and says firmly: "We're not leaving." He calls her "my soul" and kisses her, moments of warmth now cast in tragic relief.Targeted attack on press tentAl Jazeera on Sunday confirmed that al-Sharif and his colleagues — correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh and cameramen Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal, and Moamen Aliwa — were killed when an Israeli strike hit a tent used by journalists outside the main gate of a Gaza City hospital.The Israeli military confirmed it had targeted al-Sharif, calling him a Hamas "terrorist" who "posed as a journalist."Al Jazeera rejected the allegations, calling the strike a deliberate attack on the press. Media watchdogs say around 200 journalists and media workers have been killed since the war began 22 months ago.A recognisable face in GazaAl-Sharif was one of Al Jazeera Arabic's most prominent correspondents in Gaza, known for regular reporting from the north. Hours before his death, he posted on X about “intense, concentrated Israeli bombardment” of Gaza City, sharing video of nearby strikes.The undated exchange with his daughter — simple, unwavering, defiant — has become a posthumous message that transcends the war’s chaos. For supporters and colleagues, it embodies what al-Sharif himself often said: Gazans “are not leaving.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
