Shashi Throor (ANI photo) NEW DELHI:Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Monday criticised the election commission (EC) for what he called an "attack" on leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi, saying the poll panel should address serious concerns instead of insisting on formalities like an oath or an affidavit. Speaking during a protest march by opposition MPs against the revision of electoral rolls in Bihar and alleged “vote theft,” Tharoor said, “The election commission was asked serious questions by Rahul Gandhi. Those questions deserve serious answers. Instead, they are insisting on an oath. The data Rahulji cited is EC’s own data. The EC can look at its own data.” Tharoor argued that the EC’s focus on procedure was misplaced. “Rather than getting stuck on formalities, they should address the doubts raised in people’s minds. The integrity of our electoral system is vital for our democracy, too precious to tamper with,” he said. On the EC’s pushback against Rahul’s claims, Tharoor repeated, “We want answers, not attacks.” Later, in a post on X, he said it was in the EC’s own interest to clear doubts about the credibility of the process. “Flaws pointed out could be addressed and fears of voter list manipulation laid to rest. The nation is entitled to a response,” he wrote. EC officials have been seeking a signed declaration from Gandhi to back his allegations. “Rahul Gandhi should either give a declaration as per the rules, or apologise to the country for his false allegations,” an EC official said, as quoted by PTI.Last week, Gandhi had claimed, citing EC data from the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, that over one lakh votes were “stolen” in a Karnataka Assembly segment through five types of manipulation. Citing internal Congress analysis, Gandhi said his party expected to win 16 seats in Karnataka but secured nine. He alleged “vote chori” (vote theft) of 100,250 votes in the Mahadevapura Assembly segment through methods including duplicate entries, fake addresses, and bulk voter registrations.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
