The BMC closed the area citing health concerns, leading to clashes. Vijay alleges political motivation and vows defiance, even against court orders, claiming widespread Jain support.  NEW DELHI: Jain monk Muni Nileshchandra Vijay has threatened to launch an indefinite hunger strike from August 13 to protest the closure of Dadar Kabutarkhana, where people traditionally feed pigeons. He declared that the Jain community would defy even court orders if they went against religious practices, according to news agency PTI."The Jain community is peaceful, but if needed, we will take up arms for our religion," he added.The controversy erupted after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on August 6 covered the pigeon-feeding area with tarpaulin to discourage the practice, citing health hazards. Protesters tore down the cover and clashed with police. On Sunday, the BMC restored the barricades and covered the site with silver-coloured plastic sheets, with marshals and police deployed to prevent feeding.Vijay alleged the ban was politically motivated ahead of elections and claimed over 10 lakh Jains from across India would join the protest. "From ants to elephants, no living being should die of hunger. Why is Jainism being targeted? Show how many people die after consuming liquor and chicken," he said.The ban has been challenged in the Bombay high court. On August 7, the HC clarified it had not ordered the closure of kabutarkhanas but had declined to stay the BMC’s decision, emphasising that “human life is of paramount importance.” A committee of experts is expected to study the future of Mumbai’s kabutarkhanas.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
