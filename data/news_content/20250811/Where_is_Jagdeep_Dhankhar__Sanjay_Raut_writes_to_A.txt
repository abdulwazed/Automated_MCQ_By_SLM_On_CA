Raut's letter highlights the lack of information since Dhankhar's resignation, fueling rumors of confinement and prompting calls for transparency.  NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Monday wrote to Union home minister Amit Shah seeking clarity on the whereabouts and health of former Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar, who resigned unexpectedly on July 21 citing health reasons. In his letter, Raut expressed concern that there has been “no information” about Dhankhar since his resignation and urged the home minister to “provide genuine information” on his safety.Explained: What Led To Jagdeep Dhankhar's Sudden Exit & Who Will Be India’s Next Vice President?Raut recalled that on the morning of July 21, Dhankhar “appeared normal” while presiding over the Rajya Sabha’s Monsoon session and even engaged in a verbal exchange with Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge before adjourning proceedings.However, by 6pm the same day, his resignation was announced, a move Raut described as “shocking.” He wrote: “From July 21 till today, there has been no information about the whereabouts of our Vice President. What is his current location? How is his health? There is no clarity on these matters.”The Shiv Sena leader said attempts by Rajya Sabha members to contact Dhankhar had failed, and rumours were circulating in Delhi that the former vice president had been “confined to his residence” and “reportedly not safe.” He warned that some MPs were considering a habeas corpus petition in the Supreme Court, but he had decided first to approach Shah: “Before knocking on the doors of the Supreme Court I thought it to be prudent to seek this information from you.”Also Read: 'Heard of Laapataa Ladies not of laapataa VP': Rajya Sabha MP Kapil Sibal on Jagdeep Dhankhar's whereabouts; demands answers from Amit ShahRaut’s intervention follows similar calls from Independent MP Kapil Sibal, who questioned the silence around Dhankhar’s whereabouts. Sibal said he had “never heard of a ‘laapataa [missing] vice president’,” and noted that even Dhankhar’s family and close associates had offered no update. “The home ministry must know where Dhankhar is and must reveal it,” he said, warning that such secrecy “should not happen in a democracy.”Dhankhar, 74, resigned midterm as vice president, just two years after assuming office in August 2022. His tenure saw frequent clashes with the Opposition, including an unprecedented but unsuccessful impeachment motion.
