(PTI Photo/Arun Sharma) Former India opener and ex-selector Devang Gandhi believes the younger crop has shown they are ready for all challenges, casting doubt on Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli’s ODI futures.“How will you make players like Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rishabh Pant, Sai Sudharsan, among others, sit out when they have shown how well they can adapt? The bigger transition is from T20s to Tests. Once a player has done well in Test cricket and has the power game, ODIs should come easier to them. It is very important that the selectors and the team management sit together and take a call,” Gandhi told TOI.Greenstone Lobo predicts Virat Kohli & Rohit Sharma's ODI futureGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Gandhi stressed that regular game-time is crucial and urged the selectors to honestly assess whether Virat and Rohit can remain at their peak over the next two years.“If, say, in a year’s time, we come to a situation where one of them is not firing and we need a replacement, the team management may not have enough time to prepare a player for the job,” Gandhi said.The captaincy question is equally important, and the selectors must make a decision. Gill has already proven himself ready to lead in Tests and, given his current form, is arguably India’s best ODI batsman, averaging 59.04 with a strike rate of 99.56. His performances have earned him the team’s respect, making the ODI captaincy a natural fit.PollShould Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli continue playing ODIs?Yes, they should continueNo, it's time for younger playersOnly if they perform wellUndecided“There’s absolutely no doubt about the contribution of Rohit and Virat. But time doesn’t wait for anybody,” Gandhi added.With Rohit and Virat — who retired from T20Is in 2024 and stepped away from Test cricket earlier this year — the speculation about their ODI future has been rife. For now, though, it appears they may give one final push to the format they dominated for over 15 years.If they wish to extend their ODI careers beyond October, both may need to feature in domestic one-day competitions like the Vijay Hazare Trophy in December, as well as the ‘A’ series against Australia and South Africa, in addition to international fixtures.At this stage of their careers, however, there remains uncertainty over whether these legends would be willing to endure the grind of domestic one-day cricket in far-flung venues once again.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
