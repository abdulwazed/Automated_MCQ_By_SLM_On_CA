In India, where bookings began in a staggered fashion on Friday, the movie has already clocked Rs 14 crore in advance sales, with Rs 10 crore locked in for its opening day alone. The Tamil version leads the pack with nearly Rs 10 crore, while the Telugu and Kannada dubs have started well. The Hindi version is currently trailing but expected to accelerate closer to release.PollWhat aspect of 'Coolie' are you most excited about?Rajinikanth's performance The star castShattering records across marketsOverseas, 'Coolie's advance collections look impressive. In the North American market, the film’s premiere advance sales have already reached USD 1.7 million (Rs14 crore approx), with USD 1.45 million coming from the USA alone, where more than 56,000 tickets have been sold. This milestone surpasses the premiere record of Lokesh Kanagaraj’s 'Leo', which grossed USD 1.3 million on its premiere day in the USA. The film’s overseas total currently stands at Rs 41 crore—already higher than the lifetime foreign earnings of Kamal Haasan’s 'Thug Life'.With these numbers, 'Coolie' is well on track to beat the all-time Tamil film advance booking record of Rs 46 crore set by Leo.Rajinikanth’s biggest-ever openingDomestically, the advance numbers have already overtaken 'Jailer’s Rs 18 crore India pre-sales record, and reportedly 'Coolie' could potentially double its current figures before its August 14 release. Featuring Rajinikanth alongside Nagarjuna, Upendra, and Shruti Haasan—with a special cameo by Aamir Khan—the film is promised as a true pan-India entertainer. If early trends continue, 'Coolie' could deliver not just Rajinikanth’s career-best opening but also one of the biggest openings in Indian cinema history. Meanwhile, Rajinikanth's previous outing was the action drama film 'Vettaiyan' which was directed by TJ Gnanavel.About the AuthorEntertainment Deskमटा मनोरंजन डेस्क ही मराठी आणि हिंदी चित्रपट, ओटीटी, संगीत, मराठी टीव्ही कार्यक्रम, वेब सिरीज आणि सेलिब्रिटी बातम्यांवर केंद्रित एक उत्साही टीम आहे. चित्रपट समीक्षण, कलाकारांच्या मुलाखती, ट्रेलर विश्लेषण, गॉसिप्स आणि सोशल मीडिया ट्रेंड्सवरील विश्वासार्ह आणि मनोरंजक माहिती आम्ही सर्जनशील शैलीत वाचकांपर्यंत पोहोचवितो. माहिती आणि मनोरंजन यांचा समतोल राखणे हे आमचे वैशिष्ट्य आहे.Read MoreEnd of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous9 heart-healthy foods that cut attack and stroke riskLifestyleSaniya Iyappan steals the spotlight with her graceEntertainmentCarrie Coon’s secret weapon on TV?
