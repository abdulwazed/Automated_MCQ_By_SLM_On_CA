Ashish Chanchalani recently recounted the aftermath of the 'India's Got Latent' controversy, revealing he was the first panelist approached by police. He explained Samay Raina was in Vancouver, Apoorva Mukhija was unreachable, and Ranveer Allahbadia had disappeared. Ashish expressed frustration at the seriousness of the situation, clarifying that even his laughter was scrutinized and had to be explained to authorities. Ashish Chanchalani recently opened up about the chaos that followed the India’s Got Latent controversy, revealing how the police came knocking on his door first—while fellow panelists Samay Raina and Apoorva Mukhija remained out of reach. Chaotic two months after the controversySpeaking to Faridoon Shahryar about that difficult time, Ashish said that those two months were chaotic for everyone involved in the show. He explained that Samay was in Vancouver, Apoorva couldn’t be found and was scared, and Ranveer Allahbadia had disappeared. Since Ashish was the only one in Bandra and the police knew where he lived, they came to him first, and he had to give his statement to the police.Frustration over serious situationHe further shared his frustration about how serious the situation was. He said that while many saw it as just clickbait or a reel, facing the police and government officials was very serious. When asked why he was questioned even though he didn’t say anything controversial, he explained that people might think he wasn’t involved, but sitting in front of the police and knowing everything you say is recorded makes you realize how careful you must be. He added that he didn’t say much on the show—only laughed once—but even that was noted.Ashish also revealed that the authorities carefully examined every reaction, including his laughter, which he had to explain in detail. He said he had to tell them that he was laughing because of some inside jokes with Samay and at Ranveer’s foolishness—not at the inappropriate comment Ranveer made.Ashish defends Ranveer AllahbadiaSpeaking about Ranveer’s controversial remark, Ashish said he has known Ranveer for seven years and that Ranveer often speaks jokingly. He added that while the situation was tough for him, it was even harder for Samay, Apoorva, and the others involved.After the controversy, all episodes of India’s Got Latent were taken down from YouTube. The Supreme Court initially banned Allahbadia from posting on social media but later lifted the ban.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
