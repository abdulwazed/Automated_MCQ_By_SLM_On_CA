Mohit Suri's musical romance 'Saiyaara,' starring debutants Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda, is on the verge of surpassing Salman Khan's 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' at the box office. With India net collections at Rs 318 crore after 24 days, it needs just Rs 2.34 crore more to claim the 14th spot among highest-grossing Hindi films. Mohit Suri’s romantic musical Saiyaara, led by debutant Ahaan Panday and newcomer Aneet Padda, is just a whisker away from a major box office milestone. After 24 days in cinemas, the film’s India net collections stand at an impressive Rs 318 crore, meaning it needs only Rs 2.34 crore more to surpass Salman Khan’s Bajrangi Bhaijaan (Rs 320.34 crore) and claim the 14th spot among the highest-grossing Hindi films of all time.The journey of Saiyaara at the box office has been nothing short of phenomenal, especially considering it was a love story headlined by two fresh faces. The film opened strongly with Rs 21.5 crore on its first Friday, powered by positive reviews and strong buzz about Mohit Suri’s return to his romantic storytelling roots. Collections surged over the weekend, with Rs 26 crore on Saturday and a stellar Rs 35.75 crore on Sunday, giving it one of the highest first-weekend totals for a non-action Hindi film in recent years.EXCLUSIVE: Mohit Suri Spills On 20 Years In Bollywood - Ahaan & Aneet, Alia Bhatt Dream Collab & MoreThe momentum continued through the week, with Monday bringing in Rs 24 crore, followed by Rs 25 crore on Tuesday—a rare instance of a weekday surpassing Monday numbers. Wednesday and Thursday saw slight dips to Rs 21.5 crore and Rs 19 crore respectively, but the film closed Week 1 with Rs 172.75 crore, a remarkable start by any standard.In Week 2, Saiyaara maintained steady collections. While Friday saw a marginal drop to Rs 18 crore, the weekend again brought in big numbers—Rs 26.5 crore on Saturday and Rs 30 crore on Sunday. However, the Monday crash to Rs 9.25 crore marked the start of its gradual slowdown, with Tuesday at Rs 10 crore, Wednesday at Rs 7.5 crore, and Thursday at Rs 6.5 crore, ending the week at Rs 107.75 crore. Even so, this brought the 14-day total to a staggering Rs 280.5 crore.Week 3 was slower, beginning with Rs 4.5 crore on Friday and peaking at Rs 8 crore on Sunday. The weekdays stayed low, averaging around Rs 2–Rs 2.5 crore per day, for a weekly haul of Rs 28.25 crore.Now in its fourth week, Saiyaara is holding better than expected. Friday and Saturday brought Rs 2 crore and Rs 3.5 crore respectively, and Sunday’s early estimate stands at Rs 3.75 crore. With strong weekend multipliers and continued audience interest in urban centers and multiplex chains, industry experts believe the film will cross the Rs 320 crore mark comfortably within the next few days.The film’s success has cemented Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda as promising new talents and reaffirmed Mohit Suri’s ability to deliver commercially and emotionally resonant cinema.If Saiyaara overtakes Bajrangi Bhaijaan, it will be a landmark achievement displacing a beloved Salman Khan blockbuster from it’s 14th spot to 15th spot. With just Rs 2.34 crore to go, that historic moment is now inevitable.The film is expected to attain 14th spot before the clash between Rajinikanth's Coolie and Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR's War 2 takes place on 14th August.
