This shooting was one of three separate incidents reported within less than three hours in the same South Austin neighborhood.The first shooting occurred just before 2.48 am on North La Cross Avenue. Police officers responding to reports of gunfire found six people suffering from gunshot wounds.A 22-year-old woman was shot in the back and rushed to Mt Sinai Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Her name has not been released, according to ABC News.Among the injured were two 18-year-old boys, a 17-year-old boy, a 29-year-old man, and a 29-year-old woman. One of the 18-year-olds was shot in the chest and left arm and is in critical condition at Stroger Hospital. The 17-year-old suffered a gunshot wound to the left thigh and was also listed in critical condition at Mt Sinai Hospital.Another 18-year-old sustained a graze wound to his left hand and was treated at the scene. The 29-year-old man was shot in the right leg and remains in critical condition at Loretto Hospital. The 29-year-old woman was wounded in the right elbow and was taken to Rush Hospital in good condition.Approximately an hour before the North La Cross Avenue shooting, police responded to reports of shots fired about a block away on North Lamon Avenue. There, they found a 20-year-old woman with multiple gunshot wounds to her arm. She was also taken to the same hospital and was reported to be in good condition. No arrests have been made.Later, around 4.37 am, roughly three blocks from the first mass shooting, an 18-year-old boy was shot in the back and later died at Stroger Hospital. Another 18-year-old boy was also shot in the arm during the same incident. Police said the two teenagers were shot following an argument with a gunman who fired from a vehicle, as reported by ABC News. No arrests have been announced.Authorities have not confirmed whether these three shootings are connected. The motive behind the attacks remains under investigation.These violent events come less than a day after a mass shooting at an outdoor gathering in Baltimore, Maryland, where one person was killed and five others—including a 5-year-old girl—were wounded. The motive in that case is also under investigation.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
