Babar Azam (Screengrab) Former Pakistan captain Babar Azam’s woeful run of form continued as he was clean bowled for a duck in the second ODI against the West Indies at Tarouba.Babar had scored a scratchy 47 in the first ODI but registered a three-ball duck in the second match, falling to Jayden Seales.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Babar was left visibly stunned, gesturing in disbelief at the brilliance of the delivery. While it was indeed a fine ball, his shot selection raised questions — attempting a flick with only the half-face of the bat against a moving delivery proved costly, as it shattered his stumps. His dismissal deepened Pakistan’s woes, with the team reeling at 139/6 in 33.5 overs at the time of writing.Babar walked in at 37/1 after Pakistan lost Saim Ayub in the ninth over, having opted to bat first. Seales, already in rhythm after dismissing Ayub, delivered two dot balls to start. His third delivery was fuller, seaming away just enough to beat Babar’s flick. Off-balance, Babar missed completely, and the ball snuck between bat and pad to crash into the stumps.The dismissal added to Babar’s ongoing struggles in ODIs this year, where he is averaging just over 30 at a sluggish strike rate of 80. His poor form has already cost him a place in Pakistan’s T20I squad, having been dropped due to slow scoring.PollWhat do you think about Babar Azam's performance in the second ODI against West Indies?He needs to improve his shot selectionHe should be dropped from the teamHe will bounce back in the next matchIt's just a phase, every player goes through itRoston Chase and Justin Greaves led the West Indies to a five-wicket victory over Pakistan with 10 balls to spare in the rain-reduced second one-day international on Sunday, leveling the three-match series at 1-1.Chase’s 49 not out off 47 balls included two sixes and the winning boundary as the West Indies scored 184-5 in 33.2 overs.The hosts were chasing a revised target of 181 in 35 overs under the DLS method after multiple rain interruptions saw Pakistan’s innings end at 171-7 in 37 overs.
