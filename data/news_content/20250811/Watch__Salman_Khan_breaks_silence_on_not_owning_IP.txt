SUBSCRIBE NOW!"IPL offer hua tha us waqt, liya nahi (The IPL offer was made earlier, but I didn’t accept it at that time). "Aisa nahi hai ki pachta rahe hain hum. Khush hi hain hum" (It is not like I have any regrets, I am happy).Several Bollywood stars are heavily invested in the IPL. Shah Rukh Khan and Juhi Chawla own the three-time champions Kolkata Knight Riders, while Preity Zinta is one of the co-owners of the IPL 2025 finalists, Punjab Kings.Salman’s upcoming movie, Battle of Galwan, based on the 2020 India-China Galwan Valley conflict, is one of his most physically challenging roles to date.The film, directed by Apoorva Lakhia of Shootout at Lokhandwala fame, will feature Khan in intense action sequences and challenging shooting conditions in Ladakh."It is physically demanding. Every year, every month, every day it gets more and more difficult. I have to give more time now (for training). Earlier, I would do it (train) in one or two weeks; now I’m running, kicking, punching, and all that stuff. This film demands that," Khan told PTI.PollWould you like to see Salman Khan buy an IPL team in the future?Yes, definitely!No, I prefer him as an actor.Only if he can handle it.I have mixed feelings.The 59-year-old actor elaborated on the film’s challenging shooting schedule and locations."When I was signing the film, I thought it’s amazing, but it’s a very, very difficult film to do. I have 20 days (of work) in Ladakh and then seven to eight days (of shooting) in cold water. We will be shooting this month," Khan shared.The actor also confirmed that, unlike his traditional Eid releases, Battle of Galwan will hit theaters in January.In other developments, Khan announced that a sequel to his 2015 film Bajrangi Bhaijaan is also in progress.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
