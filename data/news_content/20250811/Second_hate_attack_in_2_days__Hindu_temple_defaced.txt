The incidents, condemned by authorities and community leaders, are being treated as linked. This follows a separate racist assault in Adelaide, where an Indian man was brutally attacked after being told to "f--- off, Indian."  A Hindu temple in Melbourne’s eastern suburb of Boronia was defaced with racist graffiti this week prompting widespread condemnation and police investigation.As reported by The Brisbane Times and The Sydney Morning Herald, offensive red graffiti with the words “Go home” and other racial slurs were found daubed across the Shree Swaminarayan Temple on Wadhurst Drive, as well as two nearby Asian-operated restaurants Kingsland Chinese Restaurant and Charles King Dumpling.Police said a healing centre on Mountain Highway was also defaced the same night, bringing the total number of sites attacked to four. “There is absolutely no place at all in our society for hate-based and racist behaviour,” Victoria Police said in a statement. Authorities confirmed that all four incidents are being treated as linked and that an investigation is under way.PollShould harsher penalties be implemented for hate crimes?Yes, definitelyNo, current laws are sufficient'An attack on our right to worship'Makrand Bhagwat, President of the Hindu Council of Australia’s Victoria chapter, told Australia Today the vandalism of the temple was “heartbreaking” for the community. “Our temple is meant to be a sanctuary of peace, devotion and unity,” he said. “To have it targeted in this way feels like an attack on our identity, our right to worship and freedom of religion.”Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan sent a personal message of support to temple management. “What happened this week was hateful, racist and deeply disturbing,” she wrote. “It wasn’t just vandalism – it was a deliberate act of hate, designed to intimidate, isolate, and spread fear.”Local interfaith networks, including the City of Greater Knox’s Multifaith Network, have expressed support. “We want to show that love and solidarity triumph over hate,” said community leader Vikrant Thakur.Indian man targeted in racist attackThis came after a 23-year-old Indian man, Charanpreet Singh, was brutally attacked and left unconscious on a street in Adelaide following a reported racist assault linked to a parking dispute. According to 9News, the men allegedly told Singh to "f--- off, Indian" before launching a violent, unprovoked assault.“They just said ‘f--- off, Indian’, and after that they just started punching,” Singh said. “I tried to fight back, but they beat me until I was unconscious.”He sustained serious injuries, including brain trauma and facial fractures. A 20-year-old from Enfield was arrested and charged, but others involved remain at large.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
