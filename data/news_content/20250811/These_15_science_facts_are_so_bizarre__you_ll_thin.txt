Over 3 trillion trees. Forests are winning the numbers game (for now).A teaspoon of neutron star weighs more than Mount EverestNeutron stars are the collapsed cores of massive stars.

It's an engineering marvel inside an animal.Octopuses have 3 hearts and 9 brainsOne brain controls the nervous system, and each arm has a mini-brain. Two hearts pump blood to the gills, one to the body. Basically, they’re the multi-core processors of the ocean.Your body glows but only in total darknessHumans naturally emit a very faint glow due to biochemical reactions.
