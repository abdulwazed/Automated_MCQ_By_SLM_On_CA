It increases the risk of colorectal cancer later in life. Excess weight affects organs and can cause lifelong health issues. Genetic factors, poor diet, and inactivity contribute to obesity. Parents can encourage balanced meals and physical activity. Limiting screen time is also important. Early action can reduce future health risks for children.  Childhood obesity is a growing health concern worldwide, affecting millions of children every year. It occurs when a child’s weight is higher than what is healthy for their age and height. Excess weight in early life not only increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease but can also raise the chances of developing colorectal cancer in adulthood. Research shows that obesity in childhood can have long-term effects on the body, including inflammation and changes in gut health. Parents play a vital role in prevention through healthy eating, active lifestyles, and reducing unhealthy food and screen time habits.What childhood obesity really meansChildhood obesity is not just about a child looking “chubby”; it’s a medical condition where their weight is much higher than what is healthy for their age, height, and sex. Unlike adults, where BMI cut-offs are the same for everyone, children’s BMI is compared against growth charts that take age and sex into account.Metabolic Syndrome & Obesity: What You Need to KnowSevere childhood obesity is generally divided into two main categories, based on how a child’s weight compares with others of the same age and sex:Class 2 obesity: This is when a child’s BMI is between 120% and 140% of the 95th percentile, or between 35 and 40 kg/m². Simply put, their weight is much higher than what is healthy for their height and age.Class 3 obesity: This is the most serious level, where BMI is more than 140% of the 95th percentile or over 40 kg/m². At this stage, the risk of serious health issues in both childhood and adulthood is significantly higher.Excess weight in childhood affects almost every organ, from the heart and lungs to the liver and bones, and can set the stage for lifelong health problems if not addressed.Common reasons children become obeseChildhood obesity often results from a mix of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Some of the most common include:Genetic predispositionIf obesity runs in the family, children may inherit genes that make it easier to gain weight and harder to lose it. Genetics can influence metabolism, hunger levels, and how the body stores fat, accounting for 40–70% of a person’s risk.Poor dietary habitsMany children consume high-calorie foods that are low in nutrients, such as fast food, packaged snacks, and sugary drinks. Some of these foods also contain additives linked to cancer risk. In fact, California recently banned four additives commonly found in snack foods, brominated vegetable oil, potassium bromate, propylparaben, and Red Dye 3, because of their strong link to cancer.Sedentary lifestyleScreen time has replaced much of the outdoor play that was common in earlier generations. According to a study published in NIH, over 90% of children above age 2 play video games, and many spend 1.5–2 hours daily on them. Reduced physical activity not only increases weight gain but also impacts muscle, bone, and heart health.How obesity in childhood is linked to colon cancer later in lifeColorectal cancer has traditionally been more common in people over 50, but it’s increasingly being diagnosed in younger adults. A major US study involving over 4.7 million participants found that:Boys who were obese early in life had a 39% higher risk of developing CRC as adults, with stronger links to cancers of the distal colon and rectum.Girls had a 19% higher risk, with rectal cancer showing the strongest connection.Researchers believe this is due to long-term effects of obesity, such as chronic low-grade inflammation, higher insulin levels, and changes in gut bacteria, all of which may promote cancer growth over time.What parents can do to prevent obesity and future cancer riskThe good news is that small changes made early can make a big difference in a child’s health and future cancer risk. Here are practical steps parents can take:Encourage balanced meals: Fill plates with vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and lean proteins.Limit processed snacks and sugary drinks: Reserve sweets for occasional treats rather than daily consumption.Promote regular physical activity: Children should be active for at least 60 minutes a day through play, sports, or outdoor activities.Set screen-time boundaries: Limit recreational screen time and encourage active alternatives.Be a role mode: Children are more likely to eat well and be active if they see their parents doing the same.Why early awareness and action on childhood obesity can help prevent colon cancer in adulthoodMany parents assume that “baby fat” will disappear as children grow, but this is not always the case. Overweight children are more likely to become overweight adults, and the earlier excess weight appears, the longer the body is exposed to the harmful effects of obesity.By understanding the link between childhood obesity and colorectal cancer, parents can take steps now to reduce their children’s long-term health risks. Schools, healthcare providers, and community programmes can also play a vital role by supporting healthy eating and active lifestyles.Childhood obesity isn’t just a short-term concern; it can lead to serious health problems decades later, including colorectal cancer. Parents can help protect their children’s future by promoting a healthy diet, encouraging regular activity, and making small but lasting lifestyle changes at home. The earlier these habits begin, the better the chances of preventing both obesity and related diseases later in life.Also Read: Eating non-veg daily is risky: Oxford study warns of heart, liver, and diabetes risks for people with these 6 conditionsAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.
