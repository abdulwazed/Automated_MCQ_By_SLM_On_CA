In an interview with Hindustan Times, he said, “Salim-Javed have had a very important part in my journey as a filmmaker, be it ‘Sholay’, ‘Seeta Aur Geeta’, or ‘Shakti’. So, writers are always dear to me. They breathe life into stories like ‘Sholay’.” Amitabh Bachchan Posts Preserved ₹20 Sholay Ticket; Fans Shower LoveTheir writing shaped the unforgettable characters and powerful dialogues from “Kitne aadmi the?” to “Basanti, in kutto ke samne mat nachna,” that continue to be a hit among people.From slow start to massive hitInitially, ‘Sholay’ did not do well at the box office. But soon, word spread and the film’s popularity grew quickly. It became the highest-grossing Indian film for over a decade.
