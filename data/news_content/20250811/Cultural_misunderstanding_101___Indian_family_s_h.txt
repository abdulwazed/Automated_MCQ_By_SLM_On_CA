The footage has gone viral and has fuelled an online debate over cultural awareness and fire safety. The clip was originally shared on Instagram.

When you're having a housewarming havan and the fire department pulls up."Shortly after the fire crew arrives, they are seen speaking with members of the family and inspecting the area.
