The mission, initially planned as a weeklong stay, stretched to more than nine months due to technical issues with the spacecraft. Starliner eventually returned to Earth without its crew, while Wilmore and Williams came back in March aboard a SpaceX capsule.A retired Navy captain, Wilmore was selected as a Nasa astronaut in 2000 and flew on three space missions, logging 464 days in orbit. His most recent mission accounted for nearly two-thirds of that time, totaling 286 days.Williams, 59, remains with Nasa and recently joined second lady Usha Vance at Johnson Space Center in Houston for a children’s summer reading challenge.“Throughout his career, Butch has exemplified the technical excellence of what is required of an astronaut,” said Nasa chief astronaut Joe Acaba. “As he steps into this new chapter, that same dedication will no doubt continue to show in whatever he decides to do next.”About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.
