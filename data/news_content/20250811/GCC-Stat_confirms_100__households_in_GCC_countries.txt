It reveals that all households within these countries now enjoy access to safe drinking water and electricity services, surpassing global averages, and underscores ongoing efforts to strengthen families and social welfare.Complete access to essential services in GCC countriesAccording to data released by GCC-Stat on August 10, 2025, 100% of households in the GCC enjoy access to safe drinking water and electricity. This is a remarkable accomplishment that places the region well above the global average, where 91% of households have similar access. The report emphasizes how GCC countries have prioritized ensuring fundamental living standards for their populations as part of their development strategies.'Stop Talking, Start Acting': Erdogan Attacked By Own For 'DOING NOTHING' To Stop Israel In GazaThe progress extends beyond utilities. The percentage of primary schools adapted for students with disabilities also stands at 100%, significantly higher than the global average of 50%. In healthcare, GCC countries report a coverage rate of 72%, modestly above the worldwide average of 68%. While there are variations among individual member states, the overall regional performance reflects strong investment in inclusive education and health systems.Commitment to family and social developmentThe report situates these achievements within the broader framework of the GCC Population Strategy, which highlights the family as a vital social unit. The strategy’s eighth goal under the social development pillar is devoted entirely to preserving family components and strengthening its societal role.To realize this goal, GCC countries implement multiple measures aimed at supporting families comprehensively. These include expanding social security networks to cover all individuals in need, ensuring their living requirements are met, and routinely reassessing eligibility for aid. Additionally, the region is focused on securing decent living conditions through job creation and encouraging small and medium enterprises, especially those led by women working from home.This family-centered approach underpins social stability and economic inclusion, recognizing the family as the foundation for community wellbeing.GCC-Stat’s role and mandate in regional developmentEstablished in Oman and officially endorsed by the GCC Supreme Council in 2012, GCC-Stat serves as the unified statistical body for the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries: the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, and Kuwait.
