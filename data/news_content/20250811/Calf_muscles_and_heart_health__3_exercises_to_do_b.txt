The circulatory process needs blood to return from your feet and legs to your heart through veins, which require working against gravitational forces. The calf muscles function as a crucial system in this process. These muscles function by contracting and relaxing to compress deep leg veins, which pushes blood toward an upward direction. The calf muscle pump function prevents blood from accumulating in your legs, while maintaining normal blood pressure levels. Blood clots and swelling along with heart strain, become more likely when calf muscles are weak or inactive.Enhanced calf muscle strength enables the heart to operate more efficiently while reducing blood pressure, and enhancing overall circulation patterns. Your calf muscles become ready for walking or exercise, when you strengthen them before physical activities, thus minimising the risk of injuries and delivering additional protection to your heart. Here are 3 such exercises...3/5Calf Raises (Heel Raises)Calf raises serve to develop both gastrocnemius and soleus muscles which are primary calf muscle groups.How to do them:Stand with your feet placed hip-width apart while using a wall or chair as support for balance if required.Slowly lift your heels off the floor, rising onto your tiptoes.Maintain this position for one brief moment to feel the calf muscles tightening.Slowly lower your heels back down to the ground.Repeat 15-20 times for 2-3 sets.Why it’s good:Calf raises engage the blood-pumping muscles, which enhance the venous return process. Regular muscle contractions through these exercises, help expand blood vessels and create blood pressure reduction effects. Before starting your walk, these exercises prepare your muscles which then become more powerful, at supporting your cardiovascular system.4/5Seated calf raisesThis exercise targets the soleus muscle, which plays a key role during activities like walking and standing.How to do them:Sit comfortably on a chair with your feet flat on the ground.You should maintain contact between your toes, foot balls, heels and floor, as you elevate your heels to their highest point.Maintain the raised position for one to two seconds, before slowly returning your heels to the floor.Repeat 15-20 times for 2-3 sets.Why it’s good:The exercise of seated calf raises provides a gentle yet effective way to strengthen the muscles, which efficiently pump blood throughout daily activities. The exercise enhances blood flow and minimises leg heaviness and swelling symptoms. This stretch before walking helps protect your heart function during exercise.5/5Calf stretch with wall supportThe practice of calf muscle stretching leads to better flexibility, while improving blood circulation to avoid muscle tightness and injuries.How to do it:Stand an arm’s length away from a wall.Place your hands flat against the wall for support.Take a step backward with one straight foot, while pressing the heel against the floor.Lower your front knee slightly and press against the wall, until you reach the stretch in your calf muscle.Maintain the stretch position for 15 to 20 seconds.Perform this stretch 2 to 3 times on each leg before changing sides.Why it’s good:Stretching allows blood flow to increase, and relaxes the calf muscles before exercise begins. Your ability to walk correctly along with cramp prevention, depends on flexible calf muscles. The stretching process improves blood circulation, which benefits heart health by making blood flow back to your heart more easily.Sources:Aster Hospitals – Calf Muscles and Heart HealthSurrey Physio – 5 Best Ways to Strengthen Your CalvesWebMD – Best Exercises for Strengthening Calf MusclesMoneycontrol – How Calf Muscles Can Keep Cardiovascular Disease at BayDisclaimer: This article is informational only and not a substitute for medical adviceFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousHow to make natural hair colour using tea and coffeeindiaDivyanka Tripathi’s top 10 stylish must-have looksindia​How to make dhaba-style Egg Curry at home​Food9 heart-healthy foods that cut attack and stroke riskindiaSaniya Iyappan steals the spotlight with her graceindiaCarrie Coon’s secret weapon on TV?
