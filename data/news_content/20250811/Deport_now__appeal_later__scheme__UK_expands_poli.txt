This initiative, part of a broader migration crackdown, seeks to prevent offenders from exploiting the system and remaining in the UK during appeals.  The UK government is expanding its deportation policy for criminals as part of its ongoing migration crackdown. The government aims to extradite foreign offenders more swiftly by including additional countries in the existing scheme. On Saturday, the government announced its intention to deport criminals immediately after sentencing under the "deport now, appeal later" policy, Independent reported.

Now this list expanded to 23 countries. And yes, India is also one of them. The current government planned to expand the partnership. Previously, offenders were returned to Finland, Nigeria, Estonia, Albania, Belize, Mauritius, Tanzania, and Kosovo for remote hearings. The additional countries include Angola, Australia, Botswana, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada, Guyana, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Latvia, Lebanon, Malaysia, Uganda, and Zambia, with further countries expected to be added.he Home Office stated that this measure is "the government's latest tool in its comprehensive approach to scaling up our ability to remove foreign criminals," highlighting that there have been 5,200 removals of foreign offenders since July 2024, marking a 14% increase compared to the previous year. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated, "Those who commit crimes in our country cannot be allowed to manipulate the system, which is why we are restoring control and sending a clear message that our laws must be respected and will be enforced." Foreign Secretary David Lammy added, "We are leading diplomatic efforts to increase the number of countries where foreign criminals can be swiftly returned, and if they want to appeal, they can do so safely from their home country. Under this scheme, we're investing in international partnerships that uphold our security and make our streets safer." Both ministers had opposed the hostile environment policy while in opposition. In 2015, Sir Keir Starmer questioned the policy's viability, noting that in-person appeals had been the norm for two centuries and were a "highly effective way of resolving differences." He also expressed concerns about the impact on children if parents were deported and subsequently returned following a successful appeal. In today’s announcement, the prime minister's administration emphasized its goal to prevent individuals from "gaming the system" and to clamp down on those remaining in the UK for extended periods while their appeals are processed.History of 'deport now, appeal later' policyThis approach was first introduced in 2014 when Baroness Theresa May served as home secretary, forming part of the Conservative government's hostile environment policy to reduce migration. Under Section 94B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, the policy led to the return of hundreds of individuals to countries such as Kenya and Jamaica. In 2017, the Supreme Court effectively halted the policy after it was challenged on human rights grounds, citing that appeals from abroad did not comply with human rights standards. In 2023, then home secretary Suella Braverman reinstated the policy after establishing more facilities abroad for lodging appeals.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
