'They will lose to India’: Ex-cricketer doubts Aus & SA’s WTC final chances
Aakash Chopra suggested that both Australia and South Africa, the finalists of the previous WTC cycle, might face difficulties in reaching the 2027 final. Despite Australia's strong start, their tour of India and an aging bowling attack could hinder their progress. South Africa's challenging away series in the subcontinent also diminish their chances of qualifying, according to Chopra.

Team Australia (Getty Images) NEW DELHI: Former India opener Aakash Chopra believes that Australia and South Africa — the two finalists of the 2023-25 World Test Championship (WTC) cycle — may struggle to reach the summit clash of the next cycle in 2027.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Speaking on his YouTube channel, Chopra, who was analysing the newly drawn fixtures, said that despite Australia’s dominant start to the 2025–27 WTC cycle, their path will be far from straightforward. Australia currently top the table with 100 percentage points after a 3-0 away sweep against West Indies.Bold prediction! Astrologer Greenstone Lobo picks winner of Australia vs South Africa WTC Final 2025“Their home series are against New Zealand, England and Bangladesh. They will 100 percent win against Bangladesh. They should win against New Zealand. They should win against England as well. However, it’s a five-match series, so they are unlikely to get full points,” Chopra said.PollWhich team is more likely to struggle in the next WTC cycle?AustraliaSouth AfricaBoth teams equallyPointing to the India tour as a potential stumbling block, he added: “I feel they will leave India after losing to them. They might win just one match. If they win only one match, they will lose a lot of points. South Africa will challenge them again. So it is not that straightforward. Decent chance, but I won’t say strong contenders.”Current WTC Point TableChopra also flagged Australia’s ageing bowling attack, warning of an imminent transition period that could impact results.The former opener was equally sceptical about defending champions South Africa’s prospects, noting their challenging schedule. “Australia, England and Bangladesh are South Africa’s home series. Australia and England are tough, and they will beat Bangladesh. The away series are against India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. South Africa have less chances. All three of their away series are in the subcontinent. They will find it difficult to even draw all three of those series,” he said.“South Africa, in my opinion, might not qualify. There is a good chance of them not qualifying,” Chopra concluded.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
