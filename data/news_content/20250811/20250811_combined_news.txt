The BMC closed the area citing health concerns, leading to clashes. Vijay alleges political motivation and vows defiance, even against court orders, claiming widespread Jain support.  NEW DELHI: Jain monk Muni Nileshchandra Vijay has threatened to launch an indefinite hunger strike from August 13 to protest the closure of Dadar Kabutarkhana, where people traditionally feed pigeons. He declared that the Jain community would defy even court orders if they went against religious practices, according to news agency PTI."The Jain community is peaceful, but if needed, we will take up arms for our religion," he added.The controversy erupted after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on August 6 covered the pigeon-feeding area with tarpaulin to discourage the practice, citing health hazards. Protesters tore down the cover and clashed with police. On Sunday, the BMC restored the barricades and covered the site with silver-coloured plastic sheets, with marshals and police deployed to prevent feeding.Vijay alleged the ban was politically motivated ahead of elections and claimed over 10 lakh Jains from across India would join the protest. "From ants to elephants, no living being should die of hunger. Why is Jainism being targeted? Show how many people die after consuming liquor and chicken," he said.The ban has been challenged in the Bombay high court. On August 7, the HC clarified it had not ordered the closure of kabutarkhanas but had declined to stay the BMC’s decision, emphasising that “human life is of paramount importance.” A committee of experts is expected to study the future of Mumbai’s kabutarkhanas.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

'We want answers, not attacks': Shashi Tharoor backs Rahul Gandhi's 'vote theft' claims; joins INDIA bloc protest
Shashi Tharoor criticised the Election Commission for allegedly attacking Rahul Gandhi instead of addressing serious concerns about electoral integrity. Tharoor emphasised that the EC should prioritise clearing doubts about potential voter list manipulation and vote theft, rather than focusing on procedural formalities like demanding an oath or affidavit from Rahul Gandhi.

Tharoor emphasised that the EC should prioritise clearing doubts about potential voter list manipulation and vote theft, rather than focusing on procedural formalities like demanding an oath or affidavit from Rahul Gandhi. Shashi Throor (ANI photo) NEW DELHI:Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Monday criticised the election commission (EC) for what he called an "attack" on leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi, saying the poll panel should address serious concerns instead of insisting on formalities like an oath or an affidavit. Speaking during a protest march by opposition MPs against the revision of electoral rolls in Bihar and alleged “vote theft,” Tharoor said, “The election commission was asked serious questions by Rahul Gandhi. Those questions deserve serious answers. Instead, they are insisting on an oath. The data Rahulji cited is EC’s own data. The EC can look at its own data.” Tharoor argued that the EC’s focus on procedure was misplaced. “Rather than getting stuck on formalities, they should address the doubts raised in people’s minds. The integrity of our electoral system is vital for our democracy, too precious to tamper with,” he said. On the EC’s pushback against Rahul’s claims, Tharoor repeated, “We want answers, not attacks.” Later, in a post on X, he said it was in the EC’s own interest to clear doubts about the credibility of the process. “Flaws pointed out could be addressed and fears of voter list manipulation laid to rest. The nation is entitled to a response,” he wrote. EC officials have been seeking a signed declaration from Gandhi to back his allegations. “Rahul Gandhi should either give a declaration as per the rules, or apologise to the country for his false allegations,” an EC official said, as quoted by PTI.Last week, Gandhi had claimed, citing EC data from the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, that over one lakh votes were “stolen” in a Karnataka Assembly segment through five types of manipulation. Citing internal Congress analysis, Gandhi said his party expected to win 16 seats in Karnataka but secured nine. He alleged “vote chori” (vote theft) of 100,250 votes in the Mahadevapura Assembly segment through methods including duplicate entries, fake addresses, and bulk voter registrations.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Deputy CM DK Shivakumar rebuked Rajanna, disagreeing with his assessment, while speculation arose about Rajanna's potential resignation following his dissenting remarks on vote theft, prompting a meeting with the CM. KN Rajanna (File photo) NEW DELHI: Congress leader KN Rajanna submitted his resignation from the post of Karnataka Cooperation Minister on Monday after the party’s high command reportedly asked him to step down. This followed his critical remarks about his own party, where he expressed concern that they had failed to address alleged lapses in the electoral rolls before the election. He stated that the party “should feel ashamed” because these “irregularities happened right in front of our eyes.”While he supported the party's "irregularity" charge, Rajanna also questioned the alacrity of the Congress party, saying the voter list was prepared when Congress was in power."At that time, was everyone just sitting quietly with eyes closed?" he asked, adding that the party "should feel ashamed".PollIs it acceptable for party leaders to criticize their own party publicly?Yes, it promotes accountability.No, it undermines the party's unity."Look, if we just start talking about such things casually, there will be different opinions. When was the voter list prepared? It was prepared when our own government was in power. At that time, was everyone just sitting quietly with eyes closed? These irregularities did take place — that’s the truth. There is nothing false in this. These irregularities happened right in front of our eyes — we should feel ashamed," the Karnataka minister told news agency PTI.'Take This As My Oath': Rahul Gandhi Dares Election Commission Over Voter Fraud Claims in KarnatakaThe leader further said that at a time when the party should have filed objections, "it kept quiet". "We didn’t take care of it at the time. That’s why we must be alert in the future....In Mahadevapura, there was indeed fraud. One person was registered in three different places and voted in all three. But when the draft electoral rolls are being prepared, we have to monitor it, right?...When the draft electoral rolls are made, we must file objections — that is our responsibility. At that time, we kept quiet and now we are talking," he said.Rajanna's remark undoubtedly miffed the party high command, which held a march to the Election Commission of India (ECI) over alleged "vote chori".Bihar SIR War Erupts on Delhi Streets, Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi Detained During March to ECKarnataka duputy CM DK Shivakumar said Rajanna was "totally at fault" and that the party's leadership will reply to his remarks.Earlier in the day, Rahul Gandhi declined to sign a sworn declaration backing his "vote-theft" allegations against the Election Commission of India, despite repeated calls from the poll body.Reiterating that the documents he cited for his “vote theft” claims came from the Election Commission’s own data, the Congress leader called it a fight for “One Man, One Vote” and questioned the state of democracy, noting that “300 MPs” were denied a meeting with the poll body. His remarks came after being released from Delhi Police detention during the INDIA bloc’s protest march to the EC office. "Why should I sign an oath? This is their data, not mine. They should take it from their own website. They are just diverting attention. And no one should think this happened only in Bengaluru; it happened in many constituencies. Today, the Election Commission is trying to hide something, but I want to tell you that one day, everything will come out," he said.BJP Slams Rahul’s ‘Vote-Chori’ Remark, Compares Him to GoebbelsALSO READ: EC repeats 'sign declaration or apologise' dare; adds ‘Rahul still has time’About the AuthorSandeep MoudgalA Journalist by profession, Sandeep Moudgal has an experience of 18 years in the field with Politics and Policy as forte.

Opposition MPs were detained during a planned march to the Election Commission to submit a memorandum regarding concerns about voter disenfranchisement. Jairam Ramesh (ANI file photo) NEW DELHI: Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh on Monday took a dig at the election commission, remarking, “Chunav aayog (election commission) is chunav aayog, it cannot be ‘churao aayog’ (theft commission)."The senior Congress leader was reacting to the detention of Congress leaders on their way to the election commission's office on Monday against the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar, which the opposition claims is part of a “vote theft” plan ahead of the state assembly polls.Ramesh accused the government of stifling democracy, saying the MPs had planned just a peaceful march from parliament to nirvachan sadan to submit a memorandum on the SIR and other issues. “Our demand was very clear, all opposition MPs wanted to hand over the memorandum together. But we were stopped right in front of parliament, near the PTI building. This is an assault on democracy, its murder,” he said. "This is too clever, cheeky reply by the ECI," he added. Police blocked the MPs from proceeding and later detained them. Several buses were stationed along parliament street, ready to take the protesters away. They were released later. The opposition has been raising the SIR issue inside parliament for days, alleging that the EC’s exercise is aimed at disenfranchising voters in Bihar. Ramesh had earlier written to the commission seeking a collective meeting with opposition MPs to discuss the revision process and other concerns. “We look forward to meeting with the commission in the highest tradition of parliamentary democracy,” his letter said.

This is their data, not mine. They should take it from their own website. They are just diverting attention. And no one should think this happened only in Bengaluru; it happened in many constituencies. Today, the Election Commission is trying to hide something, but I want to tell you that one day, everything will come out," he said."See the condition of India's democracy. 300 MPs wanted to meet the Election Commission to present a document, but they were not allowed. They are scared. What if 300 MPs come and their truth is revealed? This fight is not political anymore. This fight is for the Constitution and for One Man One Vote... We have clearly shown in Karnataka, it was Multiple Man, Multiple Vote... The entire opposition is fighting against this. It will be very difficult for the Election Commission to hide now," he added.EC, on Monday, again pressed upon Gandhi to either submit a signed declaration or "apologise to the country".Gandhi, on August 7, said internal analysis had projected 16 Lok Sabha seats for Congress in Karnataka, but the party won only nine. Investigating seven surprise defeats, he pointed to Mahadevapura, alleging “vote theft” involving 100,250 ballots.“We found 100,250 votes stolen in five different ways. Duplicate voters, fake and invalid addresses, and bulk voters in a single address, in a building with 50–60 people living. But when we go there, there is no record of those people living there. One family living in that house,” Rahul Gandhi had said.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

'Ensures representation': MHA defends LG's nominations to J&K assembly; submits affidavit to HC
The Home Ministry defended the LG's power to nominate assembly members in J&K, citing inclusivity. This came in response to a Congress leader's challenge to the Reorganisation Act. The ministry argued the nominations ensure representation for displaced communities and women. Mehbooba Mufti criticised the move as undemocratic, urging opposition to this precedent.

This came in response to a Congress leader's challenge to the Reorganisation Act. The ministry argued the nominations ensure representation for displaced communities and women. Mehbooba Mufti criticised the move as undemocratic, urging opposition to this precedent. . NEW DELHI: The union ministry of home affairs on Monday defended the power granted to the lieutenant governor of Jammu and Kashmir to nominate five members to the legislative assembly.The ministry submitted an affidavit to the Jammu and Kashmir high court in response to plea of Congress leader Ravinder Sharma challenging the constitutional validity of sections 15, 15-A and 15-B of the Jammu & Kashmir Reorganisation Act, which authorises the governor to make the nominations without the aid and advice of the council of ministers.Ravinder Sharma, former legislative council member and chief spokesperson of the J&K Congress, said in his petition that these sections could potentially turn a minority government into a majority, or the other way around.PollDo you agree with the union ministry's defense of the lieutenant governor's power to nominate assembly members in Jammu & Kashmir?Yes, it ensures inclusivity.No, it undermines democracy.In its affidavit, the ministry called the plea politically motivated and defended the provision as necessary for the inclusivity and adequate representation of all communities in the assembly. "The enactment of the sections was necessitated to ensure adequate representation and inclusivity in the legislative assembly of the union territory of Jammu & Kashmir," the centre said.Under these provisions, the LG could nominate three assembly members — two from the Kashmiri migrant community, including at least one woman, and one from among those displaced from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The affidavit said that women were not adequately represented in the assembly, and the provision would help raise the voices of such historically underrepresented communities. The MHA further said two members from the Kashmiri migrant community were needed as several parts of the region have faced unrest for decade. It added that there is currently no assembly representative for those displaced from Pakistan-occupied Jammu & Kashmir, making this provision essential.The affidavit added that as a union territory, J&K was governed by the parliament of India.

Pakistan army chief Asim Munir (File photo) NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs (MEA) on Monday hit back at Pakistan army chief Asim Munir’s recent anti-India remarks made in the United States, calling Pakistan "an irresponsible state with nuclear weapons" and adding that "nuclear sabre-rattling is Pakistan’s stock in trade."In an official statement, the MEA said: “Our attention has been drawn to remarks reportedly made by the Pakistani chief of army staff while on a visit to the United States. Nuclear sabre-rattling is Pakistan’s stock in trade.”Reiterating India’s stance, the MEA said: "India has already made it clear that it will not give in to nuclear blackmail. We will continue to take all steps necessary to safeguard our national security."They added: "It is also regrettable that these remarks should have been made from the soil of a friendly third country."PollIs nuclear sabre-rattling becoming a norm in international relations?Yes, it's worrying.No, it's just posturing.Highlighting Pakistan's terrorism problem, failed democracy, and the military’s control over the Islamabad government, news agency PTI said, quoting sources: "The international community can draw its own conclusions on the irresponsibility inherent in such remarks, which also reinforce the well-held doubts about the integrity of nuclear command and control in a state where the military is hand-in-glove with terrorist groups."Op Sindoor: Report Reveals Pakistan Lost Rs 1240cr In 2 Months After Shutting Airspace For IndiaSpeaking at an event in Tampa, Florida, on Sunday, Munir had threatened to destroy any Indian infrastructure that could impact water flow to Pakistan.

A helpline will be set up within a week for reporting dog bites. File photo NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court, in a suo motu case on dog bite incidents in the national capital, directed the Delhi government to begin picking up stray dogs from all localities, keep them at shelters and not release them back onto streets, colonies or public places.The court warned of action against anyone obstructing the removal of strays, citing larger public interest and stressing that infants and young children must not fall prey to such attacks. Calling the situation 'extremely grim', it said immediate steps were needed.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said as of now, the dog shelters be created to accommodate around 5,000 stray dogs and sufficient personnel should be deployed there to sterilise and immunise the canines.It said the stray dogs be kept at dog shelters and not be released on streets, colonies and public places."We are issuing these directions keeping larger public interest in mind," the bench said according to news agency PTI, adding that infants, young children should not at any cost fall prey to stray dog bites leading to rabies.At present, the Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules, 2023, mandate that stray dogs be sterilised, vaccinated and returned to their original location, thus prohibiting their relocation. The ABC Rules were framed under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, and the Supreme Court has reinforced the principle that street canines should not be relocated.In the first six months of the year, 35,198 animal bite incidents were reported across the capital. MCD's standing committee also formed a subcommittee earlier this month to focus exclusively on street dog management. The panel held its first meeting on Thursday, during which it decided to re-engage the NGOs currently involved in the sterilisation programme and enlist more organisations capable of carrying out the same task. An intensive month-long sterilisation drive is also being planned, according to officials.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

He emphasised India's commitment to its culture of global welfare, even with economic growth. Gadkari also highlighted the importance of innovation and research to boost India's economic growth and self-reliance.  NEW DELHI: Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Sunday took a veiled attack at US President Donald Trump for his tariff policy, saying, "those who are doing 'dadagiri' are doing so because they are financially strong and have technology."While delivering a lecture at the Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT) in Nagpur, Gadkari said that India would remain guided by its culture despite becoming financially strong."If our export and economic growth rate increases, I don't think we will need to go to anyone. Those who are doing 'dadagiri' are doing so because they are financially strong and have technology," Gadkari said. "Today, if we become financially strong and also become ahead in technology, even after this, we will not bully anyone because this is not in our culture. Our culture teaches us that the welfare of the world is the most important," he added.Also Read: 'Rapid service': Donald Trump presses China to increase soybean imports to ease deficit; tariff deadline expiry loomsHis remarks came after the US president imposed a 50 per cent tariff on India.The BJP leader also highlighted the importance of innovation, "Today the solution to all the problems of the world is science, technology and knowledge. If we use these three things, then we will never have to bow down to the world. Research centres, IITs, and engineering colleges should conduct research with the country's needs in mind. There are different things in all districts, states and regions. We have to work keeping everyone in mind. If we do such work continuously, then the growth rate of our country's economy will increase up to three times."About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Delhi Police halted the march, leading to dramatic scenes of leaders climbing barricades.  NEW DELHI: Opposition MPs from the INDIA bloc, including senior leaders Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, and Sharad Pawar, were stopped by Delhi Police on Monday as they marched from Parliament to the Election Commission headquarters. The demonstration was held against the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar and allegations of “voter fraud” during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.Parliament monsoon session live updateWearing white caps marked with a red cross over the words “SIR” and “vote chori”, the leaders raised slogans and carried placards accusing the Election Commission of collusion with the government. The march began at Parliament’s Makar Dwar with the national anthem but was halted at Transport Bhawan, where police had set up heavy barricading.Here's the latest developments:Rahul, Priyanka Gandhi detainedDelhi police detained INDIA bloc MPs, including Lok Sabha Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi and Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi, for holding the unauthorized protest.Joint Commissioner of Police Deepak Purohit told ANI, "The detained INDIA bloc leaders have been taken to a nearby Police Station. We are still counting the number of MPs detained. There was no permission for a protest here, but we had intimation."New Delhi DCP Devesh Kumar added, "There was a permission for 30 MPs from the Election Commission. Since they were in large numbers, we detained them. We will take 30 MPs (to the Election Commission of India) when we get their names."Opposition march halted by police barricadesOpposition MPs, including Leaders of Opposition Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge, attempted a march from Parliament House to the Election Commission on Monday to protest against the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar and alleged “vote chori”. The procession, which began at Parliament’s Makar Dwar after the national anthem, was halted outside the PTI building by heavy police barricading. Women MPs, including saree-clad TMC’s Mahua Moitra and Congress’ Sanjana Jatav and Jothimani, climbed the barricades to raise slogans against the EC. Many MPs sat on the road, chanting, before being whisked away in buses lined along the route. The march aimed to submit a memorandum to the EC but was stopped before reaching Nirvachan Sadan.Akhilesh Yadav scales barricades in defianceSamajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav accused authorities of using police to “stop us” from reaching the EC. Before sitting down in protest, Yadav climbed the barricades, chanting slogans against the SIR exercise. “They are using the police to stop us,” he said. His actions were mirrored by other opposition leaders, who scaled the barriers as a symbolic rejection of what they see as state overreach. Yadav has previously accused the ruling BJP of manipulating electoral processes in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, and joined other INDIA bloc leaders in demanding a transparent revision of voter rolls ahead of the Bihar assembly elections.Rahul Gandhi calls it a fight for the ConstitutionAs he was detained and taken away in a police bus, Rahul Gandhi said, “This fight is not political, but it is aimed at saving the Constitution. This fight is for ‘one man, one vote’ and we want a clean, pure voter list.” He accused the government of silencing opposition voices, adding, “They cannot talk as the truth is before the entire nation….” Gandhi also helped TMC’s Moitra and Mitali Bag after they fainted during the protest. The Congress leader has consistently alleged “vote theft” in Bihar’s electoral process, claims denied by the Election Commission and the BJP, who have challenged him to present evidence.Kharge says protest is to save democracyCongress president Mallikarjun Kharge was among those detained. He described the protest as “a fight to protect the people’s right to vote” and “a struggle to save democracy”. In a post on X, Kharge wrote, “BJP’s cowardly dictatorship will not work!” He also accused the BJP of conspiring to “shred the Constitution” through the SIR process, which the opposition claims is intended to disenfranchise voters in poll-bound Bihar ahead of assembly elections later this year. Kharge vowed that the INDIA bloc would “surely expose” what he termed as a “BJP conspiracy”, stressing that the electoral roll must remain free from manipulation.Priyanka Gandhi: ‘Government is cowardly’Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra led slogans during the march and was later detained by Delhi Police. Speaking at the protest, she said, “Dare hue hai. Sarkaar kaayar hai (They are scared. This government is cowardly).” She joined other senior leaders in accusing the EC of collusion with the government. Alongside her, several women MPs climbed barricades in defiance, including TMC’s Moitra, Sushmita Dev, and Sagarika Ghose. The protest banners read “SIR+Vote Theft=Murder of Democracy” and “SIR – Loktantra Par Vaar”. Priyanka has been vocal in Parliament against the SIR, alleging that it undermines the democratic process and erodes public trust in elections.BJP hits backUnion Minister Dharmendra Pradhan accused opposition parties of trying to “create anarchy in the country”. He dismissed Rahul Gandhi’s “vote theft” claim as a “lie” and alleged the protests were part of a “well thought out strategy to create instability”. Pradhan said, “Congress and other opposition parties want to make ‘intruders’ voters in the country.” He urged the opposition to raise the matter in Parliament rather than staging protests. “You cannot adversely impact PM Modi’s leadership, people’s decision, country’s constitutional system by creating fear in the minds of people,” he said, insisting that the EC’s process was lawful and necessary.EC restrictions spark fresh criticismAccording to opposition leaders, the EC only allowed 30 individuals to enter its office, a move criticised as undemocratic. KC Venugopal questioned, “What democracy is there in the country? MPs don’t have the freedom to go to the Election Commission.” He said police “want to stop us here” and accused the government of avoiding accountability. The EC’s stance, according to opposition MPs, undermines its role as a neutral electoral watchdog. The restriction has become another flashpoint in the INDIA bloc’s ongoing standoff with the Commission, which they accuse of enabling voter list manipulation in Bihar.Parliament deadlock over SIR continuesThe SIR dispute has paralysed Parliament since the Monsoon session began on 21 July. Opposition MPs have staged repeated walkouts and disruptions, demanding a debate on the Bihar voter roll revision and alleged electoral irregularities. Government business has been minimal, except for brief discussions on Operation Sindoor. The INDIA bloc has made the SIR its central issue, linking it to broader claims of democratic erosion under the BJP. The EC has rejected the allegations, insisting its procedures meet legal standards.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

However, the court removed the Rs 1 lakh penalty previously imposed. A Delhi court had earlier issued a warrant against Patkar for not complying with the sentencing order. The Delhi High Court had also supported Patkar's conviction, stating that her challenge relied on minor technicalities. Medha Patkar (File photo) NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday confirmed activist Medha Patkar's conviction in a defamation case filed by Delhi lieutenant governor VK Saxena. The top court set aside a penalty of Rs 1 lakh imposed on Medha Patkar in the case.On April 23 this year, a Delhi court issued a non-bailable warrant against activist Medha Patkar, observing that she was deliberately flouting its sentencing order to submit probation bonds and Rs 1 lakh as fine in Saxena's 2001 defamation case.Additional sessions judge Vishal Singh observed that instead of appearing before the court to comply with the sentencing of April 8, the 70-year-old social activist had remained absent and deliberately failed to comply with the order to avail of the benefit of probation subject to furnishing the compensation amount.PollIn your opinion, was the defamation notice against Medha Patkar warranted?Yes, her statements were harmful.No, it was an attack on free speech."The intention of the convict is apparent. She is deliberately violating the court order; she is avoiding appearing before the court and also avoiding accepting the terms of the sentence passed against her," the judge said on Wednesday. On April 8, the sessions court had released Patkar on "probation for good conduct" in the defamation case against Saxena, who headed an NGO in Gujarat in 2001. The sessions court modified the order of a magisterial court on July 1, 2024, sentencing her to five months of simple imprisonment. It asked her to deposit compensation of Rs 1 lakh, which was to be released to Saxena.Two days later, on April 25, Delhi Police arrested Patkar. However, the Delhi high court, the same afternoon, deferred till May 20 the sentence of Patkar.In July, the Delhi high court upheld the conviction and punishment awarded to activist Medha Patkar and noted that the trial court order, against which Patkar approached the high court, did not require any interference as the challenge was "more in the nature of hair-splitting and hinged on technicalities."The high court pointed out that in the appeal, Patkar did not even refer to the text and context of the defamatory press note that had triggered the defamation suit as it alleged Saxena was "mortgaging" the people of Gujarat and their resources to foreign interests, prompting the trial court to declare it a direct attack on his integrity and public service. "The record suggests that the essential ingredients of Section 499 of the IPC are clearly made out. The imputations made were specific, published in the public domain, and caused harm to the reputation of the respondent," the high court noted in its order, saying it found no illegality in the conclusions reached by the trial court.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The Karnataka CEO has requested documents related to Gandhi's assertion that a voter cast two ballots, citing discrepancies in ECI records. Rahul Gandhi (PTI photo) NEW DELHI: The Election Commission, following notices from the chief electoral officers (CEOs) of Karnataka and Haryana, has reiterated that Rahul Gandhi "still has time" he should either submit a formal declaration supporting his "vote theft" allegations or "apologise to the country."The Karnataka CEO has asked the Congress MP to submit documents to support his "vote theft" allegations against the Election Commission of India.In a letter dated August 10, the Karnataka CEO noted that Rahul Gandhi, during his August 7 press conference, claimed to have presented documents from ECI records alleging that a voter, Shakun Rani, voted twice based on data shown by a polling officer.PollWhat should be the primary focus of the Election Commission moving forward? Improving voter registration processesEnsuring fair election practicesThe polling body said that in a preliminary inquiry, Shakun Rani denied voting twice, and the tick-marked document displayed by Rahul Gandhi was not issued by the polling officer, raising doubts about its authenticity.The Karnataka CEO has asked Rahul Gandhi to “provide the relevant documents” forming the basis of his allegation so that a detailed investigation can be carried out by the state’s electoral authorities.On August 7, citing internal analysis, the Leader of the Opposition said Congress had expected to win 16 Lok Sabha seats in Karnataka but secured only nine. He said the party investigated seven unexpected losses, focusing on Mahadevapura, where he alleged vote theft involving 100,250 votes.“We found 100,250 votes stolen in five different ways. Duplicate voters, fake and invalid addresses, and bulk voters in a single address, in a building with 50–60 people living. But when we go there, there is no record of those people living there. One family living in that house,” Rahul Gandhi said.The ECI, on Saturday, again asked the Congress MP to either give a declaration in line with the rules or apologise to the country for what it called “false” allegations about voter lists.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

'Heart-stopping moment': Congress MP KC Venugopal claims 'another aircraft was on same runway'; Air India contradicts him
Air India refuted Congress MP KC Venugopal's account of a harrowing flight, stating the diversion to Chennai was due to a suspected technical issue and poor weather, not another aircraft on the runway. Venugopal dismissed Air India's explanation, demanding an inquiry and alleging the airline was lying. BJP's Amit Malviya called the matter serious, highlighting the contradiction and demanding accountability.

Venugopal dismissed Air India's explanation, demanding an inquiry and alleging the airline was lying. BJP's Amit Malviya called the matter serious, highlighting the contradiction and demanding accountability.  NEW DELHI: Air India on Monday issued a clarification over its Thiruvananthapuram–Delhi flight AI2455 after senior Congress leader and MP KC Venugopal, who was on board, described it as a "harrowing journey." The airline said the diversion to Chennai was a "precautionary" measure due to a suspected technical snag and poor weather, rejecting Venugopal’s claim that another aircraft on the runway had forced the plane to abort its landing.'Air India is lying': claims Congress MPVenugopal dismissed the airline’s explanation, saying, "Air India is lying" and calling for an investigation. "There should be an inquiry into the issue. An unfortunate incident happened yesterday. It was announced by the pilot that there was another aircraft on the runway when we were going to land. I spoke to DGCA as well. Let them have an inquiry. Air India is lying…" the Congress MP said.Also Read: Air India flight with K C Venugopal makes emergency diversion; Trivandrum–Delhi flight lands in ChennaiAir India's clarificationIn its statement on X addressed to Venugopal, Air India said: "Dear Mr Venugopal, we would like to clarify that the diversion to Chennai was precautionary due to a suspected technical issue and poor weather conditions. A go-around was instructed by Chennai ATC during the first attempted landing at Chennai airport, not because of the presence of another aircraft on the runway. Our pilots are well-trained to handle such situations, and in this case, they followed standard procedures throughout the flight. We understand that such an experience can be unsettling and regret the inconvenience the diversion may have caused to you. However, safety is always our priority. Thank you for your understanding."PollDo you think KC Venugopal's claims about the flight are valid?Yes, I trust his account.No, I believe Air India more.'Suspecting weather radar malfunction, they diverted to Chennai': DGCAMeanwhile, DGCA released a detailed statement on Air India's diversion: "On Aug 10, 2025, Air India A320 aircraft VT-TNL was scheduled to operate flight AI2455 (TRV-Delhi) with scheduled time of departure as 7.15 pm. Due to late arrival of aircraft from Delhi, aircraft departed TRV at 8.04 pm. During flight, the aircraft encountered moderate turbulent conditions. Crew observed that weather information depicted on the weather radar was not accurate. Suspecting weather radar malfunction, they diverted to Chennai."'Heart-stopping moment'Earlier, Venugopal had posted on X: "What began as a delayed departure turned into a harrowing journey. Shortly after take-off, we were hit by unprecedented turbulence. About an hour later, the Captain announced a flight signal fault and diverted to Chennai. For nearly two hours, we circled the airport awaiting clearance to land, until a heart-stopping moment during our first attempt – another aircraft was reportedly on the same runway. In that split second, the Captain’s quick decision to pull up saved every life on board. The flight landed safely on the second attempt."He added, "We were saved by skill and luck. Passenger safety cannot depend on luck."Following the diversion, Air India arranged another Airbus A320neo (VT-TQE) to fly passengers from Chennai to Delhi as AI2455. The TRV–Delhi flight, which normally takes 3.5 hours and is scheduled to depart at 7:15 pm, left Thiruvananthapuram at 8 pm on Sunday, landed in Chennai at 10:39 pm, and resumed the journey at 1:40 am, finally reaching Delhi at about 4 am.BJP's reactionReacting to the incident, BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya called the matter "extremely serious" and flagged the contradiction between Venugopal’s account and Air India’s clarification."If senior Congress leader KC Venugopal claims an Air India flight had to abort landing in Chennai because another aircraft was on the runway and the airline immediately contradicts him, then one of them is misrepresenting facts. Aviation safety is paramount, and social media posts from supposedly responsible people cannot go unscrutinised. If the allegation is true, Chennai ATC and Air India have much to answer for. If not, Mr Venugopal should face consequences, including being put on a no-fly list for spreading falsehoods," Malviya said.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

CEOs of Maharashtra, Haryana issue fresh letter to Rahul Gandhi, give him 10 days to prove 'voter fraud' claims
Election officials in Maharashtra, Haryana, and Karnataka are pressing Rahul Gandhi for evidence. This relates to his claims of fraudulent voter additions and duplicate voting. Shakun Rani denies voting twice, contradicting Gandhi's assertion. The Election Commission urges Gandhi to provide a declaration or apologise.

This relates to his claims of fraudulent voter additions and duplicate voting. Shakun Rani denies voting twice, contradicting Gandhi's assertion. The Election Commission urges Gandhi to provide a declaration or apologise. Failure to provide proof could lead to legal repercussions, including potential charges for false evidence and forgery.  NEW DELHI: The chief electoral officers of Maharashtra and Haryana on Sunday sent fresh letters to Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi, giving him 10 days to furnish a signed declaration with particulars of electors he alleged were fraudulently added, so that necessary proceedings may be initiated.Karnataka CEO too sent a notice to Rahul on Sunday, citing Mahadevapura voter Shakun Rani’s denial of his claim at a recent press conference that she had voted twice from Mahadevapura AC in 2024 Lok Sabha polls. The Congress leader was requested him to provide the documents based on which he had reached the conclusion, so that a detailed inquiry could be held. “On inquiry, Smt Shakun Rani (the voter in question) had stated that she has voted only once and not twice, as alleged by you. Preliminary inquiry conducted by this office also reveals that the tick-marked document shown by you in the presentation is not a document issued by the polling officer," the CEO said in a letter sent to the Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha.PollHow confident are you in the integrity of the electoral process in India?Very confident.Somewhat confident.The Election Commission, in wake of the Karnataka CEO’s latest letter to Rahul, once again asked him to submit a timely response. “He should either file the declaration/oath under Rules 20(3)b of the Registration of Electors Act 1960 or apologise to the nation for making baseless allegation against EC,” said an EC functionary.Sources said if Rahul does not furnish a declaration, his claims cannot be investigated since the law requires evidence by any person (who is not a voter in that particular constituency himself) to be tendered on oath. If Rahul were to furnish an oath and the evidence and it is found to be fabricated or false, Section 227 and 229 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) (giving false evidence) shall kick in; the section provides for jail term up to three years and, if this false evidence is repeated in court, it invites jail up to seven years. Also, making false allegations in connection with preparation, revision or correction of electoral roll or inclusion/exclusion of any entry in electoral roll, is punishable with imprisonment up to one year under Section 31 of the Representation of the People Act, 1950.Meanwhile, EC sources on Sunday told TOI that the alleged polling records shown by Rahul as “EC data” with 'tick marks' against Shakun Rani's name, appear fabricated, as such records form part of Form 17A maintained and retained by the polling officer. Access to Form 17A is limited to authorised EC officials and these are not shared with the political parties. The parties' polling agents do get polling records but in Form 17C, which do not contain the voters' photographs. Form 17A is only produced before the court when sought in any judicial proceeding. Flashing a "forged document" at a press conference could spell legal consequences for Rahul as he may face an FIR for violation of Section 337 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023, which provides for jail term up to seven years for forging a govt-issued ID like voter identity card or a register maintained by a public servant. Also being in possession of such forged documents is a criminal offence under Section 339 of BNS, also punishable with imprisonment that can extend to seven years.EC sources said the Karnataka CEO is yet to receive any documents cited by Rahul at last week's press conference to allege 'massive voter fraud' in the state's Mahadevapura AC.Rahul Gandhi had, in his presentation at the press conference, displayed Shakun Rani's voter details in the electoral roll "obtained through RTI from EC ERO login" and the "BLA-marked electoral roll", and claimed in his remarks that the polling officer had ticked against her ID card twice, recording her duplicate votes. Interestingly, the role of a political party's booth level agent (BLA) is limited to activities concerning the electoral roll; it's the polling agents who represent the party and their candidates in the polling station are their polling agents.

A go-around was executed during the initial landing attempt, heightening passenger anxiety. While Air India denies a near runway collision, passengers have urged investigation into the incident. Representative image (ANI) NEW DELHI: Air India’s Thiruvananthapuram (TRV)-Delhi flight AI 2455 on Sunday night with several MPs among the passengers safely diverted to Chennai following a suspected snag — weather radar malfunction. The aircraft, an Airbus A320neo (VT-TNL), hovered arbiter Chennai for some time to burn off fuel and avoid an overweight landing. On its approach to Chennai, the plane was given a go-around by the air traffic control (ATC) — meaning asked to abort landing and then touch down in second attempt — due to debris on the runway, which the pilots executed safely. On landing, say sources, no fault was detected in the weather radar during checks but still as a precautionary measure a key component — trans receiver — was replaced.In a detailed statement, the DGCA said: “On Aug 10, 2025, Air India A320 aircraft VT-TNL was scheduled to operate flight AI2455 (TRV-Delhi) with scheduled time of departure as 7.15 pm. Due to late arrival of aircraft from Delhi, aircraft departed TRV at 8.04 pm. During flight, the aircraft encountered moderate turbulent conditions. Crew observed that weather information depicted on the weather radar was not accurate. Suspecting weather radar malfunction, they diverted to Chennai.”AI171 crash: Lawyer meets survivor’s family, seeks answers from Boeing“To avoid overweight landing and burn extra fuel, the aircraft with air traffic control (ATC) clearance orbited 25 nautical miles northeast of Chennai for 43 minutes (from 9.25 pm to 10.08 pm). After the aircraft was cleared for approach runway 25 at Chennai, (crew was) at 10.19 pm was instructed to carry out a missed approach by ATC as departing Gulf Air flight GFA 53(Chennai-Bahrain) reported debris on left side of runway.” Apron control carried out inspection of the runway and nothing was observed. The AI aircraft was given landing clearance and aircraft landed safely at 10.39 pm. “During engineering inspection no deficiency was observed. However, as a precautionary measure, weather radar transreceiver was replaced with a serviceable one,” the DGCA said.PollIs it important for airlines to provide passengers with real-time updates during emergencies? Very important Somewhat importantA combination of multiple factors including slight delayed departure from TRV, bad weather, announcement of the flight diverting due to a snag, hovering over Chennai and then a go-around added to the anxiety of passengers. Congress MP K C Venugopal who represents Alappuzha in Lok Sabha was among the parliamentarians on board. He said on X early Monday morning: “AI 2455 from Trivandrum to Delhi, carrying myself, several MPs, and hundreds of passengers, came frighteningly close to tragedy. What began as a delayed departure turned into a harrowing journey. Shortly after take-off, we were hit by unprecedented turbulence. About an hour later, the captain announced a flight signal fault and diverted to Chennai.”“For nearly two hours, we circled the airport awaiting clearance to land, until a heart-stopping moment during our first attempt — another aircraft was reportedly on the same runway. In that split second, the captain’s quick decision to pull up saved every life on board. The flight landed safely on the second attempt. We were saved by skill and luck. Passenger safety cannot depend on luck. I urge DGCA and aviation ministry to investigate this incident urgently, fix accountability, and ensure such lapses never happen again,” Venugopal added.Aircraft routinely go around for safety reasons due to a number of factors like unstabilised approach or a plane/vehicle being on the runway it is supposed to land on. Air India denied that AI 2455 was asked to go around because there was another aircraft on the runway.An AI spokesperson said: “The flight crew of AI2455 operating from Thiruvananthapuram to Delhi on August 10 made a precautionary diversion to Chennai due to a suspected technical issue and given the weather conditions enroute. The flight landed safely in Chennai, where the aircraft will undergo the necessary checks. We regret the inconvenience caused to affected passengers…. At AI, safety of our passengers and crew remain top priority.”Congress MP for Virudhunagar Manickam Tagore B who as also on board said on X: “Shocked & shaken. Air India AI 2455 from TRV to Delhi, carrying MPs & hundreds of passengers, narrowly escaped disaster today — turbulence, flight signal fault, and a near runway collision in Chennai…. Passenger safety cannot rely on luck. We demand answers & action now.”Replying to him, AI said: “…diversion to Chennai was precautionary, due to a suspected technical issue and poor weather conditions. A go-around was instructed by Chennai ATC during the first attempted landing, not because of the presence of another aircraft on the runway. Our pilots are well-trained to handle such situations, and in this case, they followed standard procedures throughout the flight…”Air India arranged another Airbus A320neo, VT-TQE, which flew the passengers from Chennai to Delhi as AI 2455. The usual flying time of AI 2455 (TRV-Delhi) is 3.5 hours with a schedule departure time 7.15 pm. According to flight tracking sites, it took off with a slight delay on Sunday at 8 pm & landed in Chennai at 10.39 pm. The alternate aircraft took off from Chennai at 1.40 am & landed in Delhi at about 4 am.Seasoned aviators say while AI 2455 had a routine suspected snag, passenger anxiety levels have expectedly been higher post the deadly June 12 AI 171 crash in Ahmedabad and subsequent incidents.

Raut's letter highlights the lack of information since Dhankhar's resignation, fueling rumors of confinement and prompting calls for transparency.  NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Monday wrote to Union home minister Amit Shah seeking clarity on the whereabouts and health of former Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar, who resigned unexpectedly on July 21 citing health reasons. In his letter, Raut expressed concern that there has been “no information” about Dhankhar since his resignation and urged the home minister to “provide genuine information” on his safety.Explained: What Led To Jagdeep Dhankhar's Sudden Exit & Who Will Be India’s Next Vice President?Raut recalled that on the morning of July 21, Dhankhar “appeared normal” while presiding over the Rajya Sabha’s Monsoon session and even engaged in a verbal exchange with Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge before adjourning proceedings.However, by 6pm the same day, his resignation was announced, a move Raut described as “shocking.” He wrote: “From July 21 till today, there has been no information about the whereabouts of our Vice President. What is his current location? How is his health? There is no clarity on these matters.”The Shiv Sena leader said attempts by Rajya Sabha members to contact Dhankhar had failed, and rumours were circulating in Delhi that the former vice president had been “confined to his residence” and “reportedly not safe.” He warned that some MPs were considering a habeas corpus petition in the Supreme Court, but he had decided first to approach Shah: “Before knocking on the doors of the Supreme Court I thought it to be prudent to seek this information from you.”Also Read: 'Heard of Laapataa Ladies not of laapataa VP': Rajya Sabha MP Kapil Sibal on Jagdeep Dhankhar's whereabouts; demands answers from Amit ShahRaut’s intervention follows similar calls from Independent MP Kapil Sibal, who questioned the silence around Dhankhar’s whereabouts. Sibal said he had “never heard of a ‘laapataa [missing] vice president’,” and noted that even Dhankhar’s family and close associates had offered no update. “The home ministry must know where Dhankhar is and must reveal it,” he said, warning that such secrecy “should not happen in a democracy.”Dhankhar, 74, resigned midterm as vice president, just two years after assuming office in August 2022. His tenure saw frequent clashes with the Opposition, including an unprecedented but unsuccessful impeachment motion.

Delhi Police stated that no permission was sought for the protest. The opposition raised concerns about fake forms and discrepancies in voter lists, demanding electronic data for verification.  NEW DELHI: The INDIA bloc on Monday announced plans to march from Parliament to Election Commission's office, drawing a response from Delhi Police, who said no permission had been sought for the protest.Police officials clarified that no formal request or application had been received for the demonstration.The opposition coalition had said the march was to protest the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in poll-bound Bihar and alleged “voter fraud” in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.On Sunday, senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh said the INDIA bloc MPs had marched from Parliament to the Election Commission’s office to register their protest. At a press conference, he alleged, “All the Booth Level Officers (BLOs) were filling out ‘fake forms’ in one room.”PollWhat is your opinion on the Delhi Police's response to the protest march?The police are right to deny permission.The police should have allowed it.Singh further stated, “Rahul Gandhi put forward such facts that no one could deny... The name of one person appeared at multiple locations, including polling booths... Rahul Gandhi’s demand was for electronic data of the voter list, which could be scanned using software to determine how many votes were cast on a single EPIC number... The reason for the SIR happening in Bihar was questioned. It had been thoroughly tested in 2003, which took 2 years in Bihar, but this time they wanted to do it in 1 month...”He added, “All the BLOs were filling out fake forms in one room. The Election Commission said that so many people had died, but their list was not provided... And MPs of the entire INDIA alliance, from all parties except the BJP and NDA alliance MPs, had marched from the Parliament to the Election Commission’s office...”The announcement of the march came days after Rahul Gandhi’s press briefing in which he made serious allegations against the poll body.On August 1, Union minister Kiren Rijiju responded, saying the government was open to discussions but not on the SIR. “I want to clarify that the government is ready to hold discussions on any issue as per the rules. There cannot be a discussion on SIR because it is a process undertaken by a Constitutional body, and it is not happening for the first time...” he told ANI.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

'ECI is not a court': Chidambaram slams poll body over SIR; terms refusal to hear complaints 'death of democracy'
P Chidambaram criticized the Election Commission of India, stating it should not act as a court. He raised concerns about ignored complaints in Bihar during the Special Intensive Revision, potentially undermining democratic elections. The ECI has asked Rahul Gandhi to provide evidence for his "vote theft" allegations or apologize, following doubts about the authenticity of documents he presented.

The ECI has asked Rahul Gandhi to provide evidence for his "vote theft" allegations or apologize, following doubts about the authenticity of documents he presented. P Chidambaram (File photo) NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader and former Union minister P Chidambaram on Sunday lashed out at the Election Commission of India (ECI), asserting that it is “not a court” and must not act like one while dealing with petitions or complaints.In a post on X, Chidambaram wrote, “The ECI is not a court and cannot behave like a court in entertaining petitions or complaints. It is an administrative body tasked with ensuring free and fair elections.”No Pak Hand in Pahalgam? Chidambaram Remarks Trigger Political Face-off Between Centre, OppositionClarifying the scope of Rule 20(3)(b), he said it applies only when an Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) accepts or rejects a specific claim to be included in the electoral rolls -- not in cases of alleged large-scale manipulation of an entire assembly constituency’s rolls.Citing a newspaper report, he alleged that complaints from Booth Level Agents in Bihar are being ignored. “If true, this refusal to entertain complaints during the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) will spell the death of democratic elections,” he warned, adding that the ECI’s duty extends beyond mere procedure to safeguarding the rights of political parties and voters.Meanwhile, the Election Commission has reiterated its stand that Rahul Gandhi must either submit supporting documents for his recent "vote theft" allegations or apologise. The reminder follows a notice from the Karnataka Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) and a follow-up from the Haryana CEO.In an August 10 letter, the Karnataka CEO said Rahul Gandhi had, during his August 7 press conference, cited ECI records to allege that a voter named Shakun Rani voted twice, based on data shown by a polling officer. However, the voter has denied the charge, and officials said the tick-marked document displayed by Rahul Gandhi was not issued by the polling officer, raising doubts about its authenticity.The Karnataka CEO has asked Rahul Gandhi to share the original documents forming the basis of his claim so a detailed investigation can be carried out.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

(Source: gretathunberg/Instagram) Climate activist Greta Thunberg on Sunday announced her second flotilla mission, which will carry aid to Gaza. This time, multiple ships will take part.The operation will launch from Spain and make several stops at different ports to reach the Palestinian people.The Swedish protester is planning to mobilise activists from 44 countries for a large-scale flotilla mission. The campaign is set to launch on August 31. Thunberg took to her social media platform Instagram to announce the decision.“On August 31st we are launching the biggest attempt ever to break the illegal Israeli siege over Gaza with dozens of boats sailing from Spain. We will meet dozens more on September 4th sailing from Tunisia and other ports. We are also mobilizing more than 44 countries on simultaneous demonstrations and actions to break complicity in solidarity with the Palestinian people. Join this initiative on this decisive moment!”About the missionThe effort is called the “Global Sumud Flotilla." It will include humanitarian activists, doctors and artists such as US actor Susan Sarandon, Swedish actor Gustaf Skarsgård and Irish actor Liam Cunningham. The group says it is an “independent” organisation not linked to any government or political party, reports news agency AFP.The mission comes after two earlier attempts to deliver aid by ship to Gaza, in June and July, were blocked by Israel, with troops boarding the vessels and detaining activists before expelling them.Previous trip: Interception of MadleenOn June 9, Israeli naval forces boarded and seized a British-flagged yacht, Madleen. The ship was operated by the pro-Palestinian Freedom Flotilla Coalition, as it attempted to break the naval blockade of Gaza. Greta Thunberg was among those on board. The vessel had planned to deliver aid, including rice and baby formula, and to draw attention to the humanitarian crisis.Israel’s foreign ministry captured the vessel and dismissed the mission as a stunt, calling Thunberg an “antisemite”. “The ‘Selfie Yacht’ docked at Ashdod Port a short while ago. The passengers are currently undergoing medical examinations to ensure they are in good health,” the ministry posted on X, adding that any remaining aid “not consumed by the ‘celebrities’ will be transferred to Gaza through real humanitarian channels.”Israeli defence minister Israel Katz had ordered the military to block the vessel, describing the trip as propaganda for Hamas.The activists were detained in international waters before being returned to their home countries. A photograph showed the crew in life jackets with their hands raised. Hamas condemned the seizure as “state terrorism”.'Mission isn’t over' The UN’s special rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, backed the flotilla launched in June and called on more boats to challenge the blockade. She said, “Madleen’s journey may have ended, but the mission isn’t over. Every Mediterranean port must send boats with aid & solidarity to Gaza.”Israel has maintained a naval blockade of Gaza since Hamas took control in 2007, citing the need to prevent weapons smuggling. The Israel-Gaza war was triggered by Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack that killed more than 1,200 people. 61,000 Palestinian deaths have been reported since, according to Gaza’s health ministry.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Kuwait: GCC expats, including Indians, now eligible for instant tourist visa on arrival in Kuwait
Kuwait now offers tourist visas on arrival to foreign residents of GCC countries with valid six-month residency, easing travel for over 30 million expatriates. This move streamlines entry, supports Kuwait’s Vision 2035 economic diversification, and boosts tourism projected to exceed $1.13 billion by 2025. It aligns Kuwait with regional efforts to enhance mobility, cultural exchange, and sustainable growth.

This move streamlines entry, supports Kuwait’s Vision 2035 economic diversification, and boosts tourism projected to exceed $1.13 billion by 2025. It aligns Kuwait with regional efforts to enhance mobility, cultural exchange, and sustainable growth. GCC expats can now get a Kuwait tourist visa on arrival at all airports and border ports with valid passport and 6-month residency/ File In a major policy shift benefiting millions of Gulf expatriates, Kuwait now allows foreign GCC residents to obtain tourist visas on arrival, without prior application or embassy procedures, lifting long-standing restrictions and opening new travel opportunities across the region.What the new policy entails Kuwait's First Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister, Sheikh Fahad Al-Yousef Al-Sabah, issued the new directive through the country’s official gazette Kuwait Alyoum on Sunday, August 10, 2025. The announcement confirms that any foreign national residing in a Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) country, that is, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, or Kuwait itself, is now eligible to receive a tourist visa on arrival, as long as their residency permit is valid for at least six months. The visa is granted directly at the port of entry into Kuwait and does not restrict eligibility based on nationality, provided the residency criteria are met. This policy immediately repeals a 2008 regulation that previously governed how foreign residents of GCC states could enter Kuwait for tourism purposes. The aim is to streamline entry procedures and improve regional mobility, particularly for non-GCC nationals residing in the region.Eligibility and entry processThe visa-on-arrival process has been designed to be simple and efficient. Upon arrival at any Kuwaiti border point or airport, eligible travelers can approach designated immigration counters. Immigration officers will check:  Validity of the GCC residency permit (minimum six months)   Valid passport and travel documentation   Once these are verified, the tourist visa is issued on the spot. This facilitates quick entry into Kuwait, without the need for prior online applications or embassy visits. The move is particularly beneficial for expats who often travel on short notice for leisure, family visits, or non-work purposes. Who benefits and why it mattersThe decision significantly impacts a large portion of the Gulf’s population. As of the end of 2024, the GCC region had a total population of over 61.2 million, and foreign residents made up more than half of that figure. Historically, while GCC citizens enjoy seamless inter-country travel, foreign expatriates have faced more restrictive entry rules, including in Kuwait. This change reflects a broader regional trend toward easing travel restrictions for expatriate residents, especially in support of intra-Gulf tourism. Countries like the UAE and Oman have already taken similar steps to liberalize visa norms for residents of neighboring Gulf states. The policy could also simplify movement for expats living in geographically close cities like Riyadh, Dammam, Manama, and Doha, making weekend travel or short leisure trips to Kuwait a practical option.Tourism and economic integrationThe visa-on-arrival policy goes beyond convenience, supporting Kuwait’s broader goal to boost tourism, a sector projected to generate over $1.13 billion by 2025. This aligns with Kuwait’s Vision 2035, aiming for economic diversification and cultural growth beyond oil. By easing travel for GCC residents, Kuwait strengthens regional ties and follows Gulf neighbors in promoting sustainable tourism, enhancing its cultural appeal, and driving economic integration across the region.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The summit aims to explore a ceasefire deal, with Russia offering control of Eastern Ukraine in exchange for a halt to hostilities.  Ahead of the upcoming meeting in Alaska between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss a ceasefire deal, Vice President JD Vance expressed a clear desire to end the funding of the Ukraine war and bring about peace."We're done with the funding of the Ukraine war business. We want to bring about a peaceful settlement to this thing," Vance told Fox News's Maria Bartiromo on "Sunday Morning Futures," as reported by The Hill.The Alaska summit aims to find a breakthrough in peace negotiations with Moscow, focusing on discussions around territorial control. Earlier this week, the Kremlin shared a ceasefire proposal with the Trump administration, offering control of Eastern Ukraine in exchange for a halt to hostilities.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has strongly opposed the deal, insisting that any agreement that excludes Ukraine undermines the prospect of peace. Though Zelenskyy was not invited to the summit, the White House and US Ambassador to Nato Matthew Whitaker have indicated the possibility of a trilateral summit.European leaders have reacted strongly to the proposed agreement, promising to support Trump's efforts diplomatically, economically, and militarily, but stressed that any resolution must safeguard Ukraine's and Europe's vital security interests, according to The Hill.During the interview, Vance highlighted American frustration with the continued financial burden of the conflict. "Americans, I think, are sick of continuing to send their money, their tax dollars of this particular conflict but if the Europeans want to step up and actually buy the weapons from American producers we're OK with that, but we're not going to fund it ourselves anymore," he said.This is not the first time Vance has called on European allies to take on a larger role. Earlier this year, Trump secured agreements for Nato members to increase their defense spending to 5 percent of their GDP and arranged for the U.S. to send lethal weapons to Ukraine funded by other Nato countries, significantly expanding Europe's economic involvement in the conflict, The Hill noted.Vance recently traveled to England to discuss these peace efforts, urging European nations to "step up and take a bigger role in this thing," adding, "if you care so much about this conflict you should be willing to play a more direct and a more substantial way in funding this war yourself."End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousSharvari Wagh brings charm to every pink detailEntertainment10 animals that can survive intense radiationLifestyleHow to make natural hair colour using tea and coffeeLifestyleDivyanka Tripathi’s top 10 stylish must-have lookstv9 heart-healthy foods that cut attack and stroke riskLifestyleSaniya Iyappan steals the spotlight with her graceEntertainmentCarrie Coon’s secret weapon on TV?

Princess Anne's 75th birthday portrait: New hair, classic Festoon Tiara, and Sir Tim by her side
Princess Anne, celebrating her 75th birthday, has released a new portrait featuring a striking style change. The Princess Royal is seen with her husband, Sir Tim Laurence, showcasing an elegant chignon instead of her signature bouffant. She adorns the Festoon Tiara, a cherished piece from her early twenties.

The Princess Royal is seen with her husband, Sir Tim Laurence, showcasing an elegant chignon instead of her signature bouffant. She adorns the Festoon Tiara, a cherished piece from her early twenties. Chris Jackson/Getty Images for Buckingham Palace Princess Anne is marking her 75th with a fresh look and a familiar sparkle. A new portrait released ahead of her birthday shows the Princess Royal standing with her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence. The image was taken before the French state banquet at Windsor Castle in July. The first thing people will notice is her hair. Anne has worn a similar bouffant style for about five decades. In this portrait she switches to a smooth chignon. It is elegant, neat, and suits the formal setting. The change is rare for her, which is why the photo drew quick attention. The second talking point is the tiara. Anne chose the Festoon Tiara, a long-time favorite in her rotation. She received it as a gift in 1973 after christening a ship for the Worldwide Shipping Group. The design sits low and balanced, which works well with the new hair. Together they create a cleaner frame around her face.Photo by Chris Jackson/Getty Images for Buckingham PalaceThe portrait also doubles as a quiet nod to partnership. Sir Tim stands with her, as he often does at major state events. The two married in 1992 and keep a low profile. Their presence together in the birthday image sets a warm tone as family plans take shape for the coming weeks. There is context behind the timing. The palace shared the photo one week before her August 15 birthday to start the celebrations. It was shot by royal photographer Chris Jackson. He captured it at Windsor before the banquet held for the French state visit from July 8 to 10. The result is formal but relaxed, a look that fits Anne’s usual style. Fashion notes aside, the image also lands after a busy and challenging year. Anne remains one of the most active working royals by engagement count. Last year she briefly stepped back after a horse-related incident near her home. She returned to duties and later said the experience was a reminder that each day is a bonus. The new portrait, bright and composed, underlines that message without a single word. Reactions so far focus on two themes. Many like seeing a small style reset that still feels like Anne. Others appreciate the continuity of the Festoon Tiara, a piece linked to her early twenties and worn across decades. It is a simple mix of new and old. That balance is what people expect from her. As the birthday week begins, more pictures and appearances are likely. For now, one frame does the job. New hair. A classic tiara. Her husband at her side. It is a quiet portrait that still says a lot about how Anne works, dresses, and shows up for the role she has held for most of her life.

GCC-Stat is the unified statistical center for Gulf countries, providing reliable data to support coordinated economic and social development/ Image: File A new report from the Statistical Centre for the Cooperation Council for the Arab Countries of the Gulf (GCC-Stat) highlights key social and infrastructure achievements across GCC nations. It reveals that all households within these countries now enjoy access to safe drinking water and electricity services, surpassing global averages, and underscores ongoing efforts to strengthen families and social welfare.Complete access to essential services in GCC countriesAccording to data released by GCC-Stat on August 10, 2025, 100% of households in the GCC enjoy access to safe drinking water and electricity. This is a remarkable accomplishment that places the region well above the global average, where 91% of households have similar access. The report emphasizes how GCC countries have prioritized ensuring fundamental living standards for their populations as part of their development strategies.'Stop Talking, Start Acting': Erdogan Attacked By Own For 'DOING NOTHING' To Stop Israel In GazaThe progress extends beyond utilities. The percentage of primary schools adapted for students with disabilities also stands at 100%, significantly higher than the global average of 50%. In healthcare, GCC countries report a coverage rate of 72%, modestly above the worldwide average of 68%. While there are variations among individual member states, the overall regional performance reflects strong investment in inclusive education and health systems.Commitment to family and social developmentThe report situates these achievements within the broader framework of the GCC Population Strategy, which highlights the family as a vital social unit. The strategy’s eighth goal under the social development pillar is devoted entirely to preserving family components and strengthening its societal role.To realize this goal, GCC countries implement multiple measures aimed at supporting families comprehensively. These include expanding social security networks to cover all individuals in need, ensuring their living requirements are met, and routinely reassessing eligibility for aid. Additionally, the region is focused on securing decent living conditions through job creation and encouraging small and medium enterprises, especially those led by women working from home.This family-centered approach underpins social stability and economic inclusion, recognizing the family as the foundation for community wellbeing.GCC-Stat’s role and mandate in regional developmentEstablished in Oman and officially endorsed by the GCC Supreme Council in 2012, GCC-Stat serves as the unified statistical body for the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries: the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, and Kuwait.

This is for American citizens living or traveling in India. It will provide real-time safety advisories and emergency alerts. The service is free and requires a simple subscription. This initiative reflects a growing trend in consular communication. Other nations are also using instant messaging for outreach.  In a bid to strengthen its communication with American citizens living or traveling in India, the US Embassy has rolled out a dedicated WhatsApp alert service. The new initiative aims to deliver real-time updates on safety advisories, important announcements, and emergency alerts directly to users’ smartphones. Designed to complement the embassy’s existing outreach platforms, this service is part of a broader effort to ensure timely and accessible information for US nationals. The program is free for subscribers, with updates ranging from travel advisories to severe weather warnings.How the US embassy’s WhatsApp alert service worksThe WhatsApp alert system is open to all US citizens in India who opt in by saving the designated number provided by the embassy and sending a simple “subscribe” message. Once registered, users will receive periodic updates, with the frequency increasing during emergencies. The embassy has assured subscribers that the service is one-way, meaning personal data is not collected and there will be no unsolicited messages beyond official alerts. The move also reflects the growing importance of instant messaging in global consular services, especially in regions where rapid communication can be critical.Why this matters for American travelersIndia attracts millions of US visitors each year, from tourists exploring its diverse landscapes to business travelers attending high-profile conferences. For many, navigating the country’s dynamic environment can involve sudden changes in travel conditions or unexpected security developments. The WhatsApp alert service offers a streamlined way to stay informed without constantly checking news feeds or embassy websites, ensuring travelers can make prompt and informed decisions. By leveraging a platform already popular in India, the embassy hopes to bridge communication gaps and reach citizens more effectively during urgent situations.A growing trend in consular communicationThe US Embassy’s adoption of WhatsApp follows a broader international trend where embassies are embracing instant messaging platforms for outreach. Other nations, including the UK and Australia, have also experimented with similar systems, citing their speed and widespread use. For the US Embassy in India, the move underscores a commitment to modern, user-friendly communication tools that meet citizens where they are.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

‘Deport now, appeal later’ scheme: UK expands policy to 23 countries — Is India on the list?
The UK government is expanding its deportation policy to include India and other nations, aiming to swiftly remove foreign criminals after sentencing under the "deport now, appeal later" scheme. This initiative, part of a broader migration crackdown, seeks to prevent offenders from exploiting the system and remaining in the UK during appeals.

This initiative, part of a broader migration crackdown, seeks to prevent offenders from exploiting the system and remaining in the UK during appeals.  The UK government is expanding its deportation policy for criminals as part of its ongoing migration crackdown. The government aims to extradite foreign offenders more swiftly by including additional countries in the existing scheme. On Saturday, the government announced its intention to deport criminals immediately after sentencing under the "deport now, appeal later" policy, Independent reported. 'Dumped in Africa': Inside Donald Trump's 3rd Country Deportations I ExplainedIs India part of the new countries list?Earlier only 8 countries were in the list, where offenders were deported. Now this list expanded to 23 countries. And yes, India is also one of them. The current government planned to expand the partnership. Previously, offenders were returned to Finland, Nigeria, Estonia, Albania, Belize, Mauritius, Tanzania, and Kosovo for remote hearings. The additional countries include Angola, Australia, Botswana, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada, Guyana, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Latvia, Lebanon, Malaysia, Uganda, and Zambia, with further countries expected to be added.he Home Office stated that this measure is "the government's latest tool in its comprehensive approach to scaling up our ability to remove foreign criminals," highlighting that there have been 5,200 removals of foreign offenders since July 2024, marking a 14% increase compared to the previous year. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated, "Those who commit crimes in our country cannot be allowed to manipulate the system, which is why we are restoring control and sending a clear message that our laws must be respected and will be enforced." Foreign Secretary David Lammy added, "We are leading diplomatic efforts to increase the number of countries where foreign criminals can be swiftly returned, and if they want to appeal, they can do so safely from their home country. Under this scheme, we're investing in international partnerships that uphold our security and make our streets safer." Both ministers had opposed the hostile environment policy while in opposition. In 2015, Sir Keir Starmer questioned the policy's viability, noting that in-person appeals had been the norm for two centuries and were a "highly effective way of resolving differences." He also expressed concerns about the impact on children if parents were deported and subsequently returned following a successful appeal. In today’s announcement, the prime minister's administration emphasized its goal to prevent individuals from "gaming the system" and to clamp down on those remaining in the UK for extended periods while their appeals are processed.History of 'deport now, appeal later' policyThis approach was first introduced in 2014 when Baroness Theresa May served as home secretary, forming part of the Conservative government's hostile environment policy to reduce migration. Under Section 94B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, the policy led to the return of hundreds of individuals to countries such as Kenya and Jamaica. In 2017, the Supreme Court effectively halted the policy after it was challenged on human rights grounds, citing that appeals from abroad did not comply with human rights standards. In 2023, then home secretary Suella Braverman reinstated the policy after establishing more facilities abroad for lodging appeals.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Al Jazeera condemns the attack as deliberate, while the Israeli military claims al-Sharif was a Hamas operative.  An emotional video of Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif speaking tenderly with his young daughter and expressing their love for Gaza has gone viral, just hours after news broke that he was killed alongside four colleagues in an Israeli strike.The 28-year-old reporter in the clip can be seen asking his daughter if she would want to leave the embattled territory. She refuses — not for Qatar, Jordan, Egypt, or Turkey — insisting repeatedly: "I want to stay in Gaza."Gaza: Al Jazeera Staff Killed In Relentless IDF Bombardment, Journo’s Final Message Reveals HorrorSeconds before the end of the video, al-Sharif asks her to tell the world their message. She looks into the camera and says firmly: "We're not leaving." He calls her "my soul" and kisses her, moments of warmth now cast in tragic relief.Targeted attack on press tentAl Jazeera on Sunday confirmed that al-Sharif and his colleagues — correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh and cameramen Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal, and Moamen Aliwa — were killed when an Israeli strike hit a tent used by journalists outside the main gate of a Gaza City hospital.The Israeli military confirmed it had targeted al-Sharif, calling him a Hamas "terrorist" who "posed as a journalist."Al Jazeera rejected the allegations, calling the strike a deliberate attack on the press. Media watchdogs say around 200 journalists and media workers have been killed since the war began 22 months ago.A recognisable face in GazaAl-Sharif was one of Al Jazeera Arabic's most prominent correspondents in Gaza, known for regular reporting from the north. Hours before his death, he posted on X about “intense, concentrated Israeli bombardment” of Gaza City, sharing video of nearby strikes.The undated exchange with his daughter — simple, unwavering, defiant — has become a posthumous message that transcends the war’s chaos. For supporters and colleagues, it embodies what al-Sharif himself often said: Gazans “are not leaving.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

He expressed regret over not seeking counseling, believing it could have helped them navigate their challenges. Justice's remarks about Berry's domestic skills sparked online debate, highlighting evolving views on gender roles in marriage. Halle Berry Image Credit: Vinnie Zuffante/Getty Former MLB star David Justice has spoken in detail about his brief marriage to Halle Berry, nearly three decades after their split. In an Aug. 7, 2025 interview on the “All the Smoke” podcast, Justice said his own expectations of a “traditional” wife shaped how he viewed the relationship in the mid-1990s. He added that if the couple had known more about counseling, they “probably could have made it.”Justice married Berry in 1993 and the pair separated in 1996. The divorce was finalized in 1997. He told hosts Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson that he was young, had limited relationship experience, and assumed a wife should cook, clean, and show strong maternal instincts. He said he did not see those traits in Berry at the time and began to question whether they should start a family. “She don’t cook, don’t clean, don’t really seem like motherly,” he recalled thinking back then.The former All-Star also said their work schedules kept them apart for long stretches while Berry filmed projects in different countries. Looking back, he believes therapy could have helped them handle time apart and mismatched expectations. “If we knew about therapy, we probably could have made it,” he said.The comments landed quickly online. Entertainment outlets highlighted the remarks, and the “cook and clean” line drew a sharp response. Several posts criticized the comment as outdated, while others noted that couples evolve and that Justice admitted his views at the time were narrow and shaped by youth. Coverage from Yahoo Entertainment reiterated that Justice framed his comments as reflection, not as a new attack on his ex.Justice also touched on a long-running rumor that he was the unnamed ex accused of abusing Berry. He has denied that for years, and in 2015 he thanked Berry on Twitter for “quashing the rumors,” though she did not name him directly. The podcast segment focused largely on his own growth and on how little he understood about relationships in his twenties.Several outlets amplified one additional claim from the conversation. Justice said Berry proposed after about five months of dating and that he agreed even though he was unsure if his heart was fully in it. He suggested the decision was rushed and that youth and inexperience played a part. While that detail drew fresh headlines, the larger theme of the interview was regret over not seeking help sooner and not understanding how to balance two demanding careers.Neither Berry nor her representatives have responded to the new comments. She has spoken in the past about refusing to stay in relationships that do not feel right and about making choices that protect her well-being. For now, Justice’s interview has reopened debate about what couples owe each other, how gender roles have shifted, and how therapy can change outcomes when both partners are willing.Key timelineMarried in 1993, separated in 1996, divorce finalized in 1997.Justice says distance, clashing expectations and lack of counseling were major factors.The “cook and clean” quote sparked online backlash and fresh media coverage.Justice’s remarks land in a culture that talks more openly about therapy than it did in the mid-90s. The reaction shows how quickly public opinion pushes back on old ideas about what a marriage should look like. Whether the conversation fades or not, the interview offers a clear takeaway from Justice himself. He says maturity and counseling might have changed the story. He also accepts that he did not have either when it mattered.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

The deceased journalists, including prominent correspondent Anas al-Sharif, were sheltering in a tent near the Al-Shifa Medical Complex.  Al Jazeera news anchor held back his tears while reporting about the death of his five colleagues, who lost their lives in an Israeli strike on Sunday. A video is going viral where an Al Jazeera anchor was seen holding back his tears while reporting. On Sunday, five Al Jazeera journalists, including well-known correspondent Anas al-Sharif, were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a journalists’ tent in Gaza City. Al Jazeera confirmed that five of its staff were killed in the strike: correspondent Anas al-Sharif, reporter Mohammed Qreiqeh, and camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal, and Moamen Aliwa. The group had been sheltering in a tent across from the Al-Shifa Medical Complex — a long-time base for media crews. Al-Sharif, 28, was among the most recognisable Arabic-language reporters covering the war, famed for his frontline dispatches from northern Gaza.  Their deaths have intensified concerns over journalist safety in Gaza, where local reporters shoulder almost all frontline coverage due to the ban on foreign press entering without an Israeli military escort.In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described Anas al-Sharif as a “Hamas terrorist” who used journalism as cover. They claimed intelligence from Gaza, including rosters, training records, and salary documents — proved his affiliation. According to the IDF, al-Sharif led a Hamas cell responsible for organising rocket attacks on Israeli civilians and troops. “A press badge isn’t a shield for terrorism,” the statement read. The military also accused Al Jazeera of integrating Hamas operatives into its reporting teams. Israel has long accused the Qatar-based network of bias, while Al Jazeera says such claims are politically motivated attempts to justify attacks on its journalists.Al Jazeera condemned the strike as a “blatant and premeditated assault” on press freedom, accusing Israel of deliberately targeting its journalists after repeated incitement by Israeli officials. The network said the slain reporters were among the last still operating in Gaza, delivering live, unfiltered accounts of the humanitarian crisis. The broadcaster warned the killings were part of a broader effort to “silence the truth” about the war, and called for urgent international intervention. It argued that the continued impunity for such attacks only emboldens further violence against the press, urging governments to pressure Israel to stop targeting media workers.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The incident occurred during clashes between Druze militias, tribal groups, and government forces. Syrian authorities have launched an investigation to identify the perpetrators, vowing to bring them to justice regardless of affiliation, while activists claim the attackers were government forces.  A shocking video has emerged from Syria, where armed men in military garb were seen shooting a medical worker at point-blank range. According to news agency AP, the viral footage, published Sunday, captured the horrifying scene at a hospital in Sweida city in southern Syria. The incident appeared to have happened on July 16, as per AP, during clashes between militias of the Druze minority community and armed tribal groups and government forces.The footage published by activist media collective Suwayda 24, a large group of people in scrubs kneeling on the floor and group of armed men standing in front of them. The armed men grab a man and hit him on the head. It appeared that the armed men were going to apprehend the man, but he resisted by wrestling with one of the gunmen. Suddenly, he was shot by an assault rifle and then a second time by another person with a pistol. A man wearing a dark jumpsuit with "Internal Security Forces" written on the back appears to lead the camouflaged gunmen into the facility. Another camera shows a tank stationed just outside the hospital entrance.Activists claim the attackers were Syrian military and security personnel. But a Syrian government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said authorities had not yet confirmed their identity, adding that investigations were underway to determine whether the assailants were affiliated with the government or tribal factions.The interior ministry said deputy minister of interior for security affairs Maj. Gen. Abdul Qader Al-Tahhan has been assigned to oversee the inquiry “to ensure that the perpetrators are identified and arrested as quickly as possible.”"We condemn and denounce this act in the strongest terms," the ministry said in a statement carried by state news agency SANA, vowing that those responsible would be brought to justice "regardless of their affiliations."

Vance hopes Musk will reconcile with Trump by the midterms, dismissing their disagreements as minor. The feud escalated after Musk criticized Trump's bill, leading to accusations and counter-accusations involving Steve Bannon, highlighting a split within the MAGA base.  US Vice President JD Vance is hoping former Department of Government Efficiency chief Elon Musk to come back into the MAGA (Make America Great Again, coined by President Donald Trump) movement by the midterms and said that if one is patriotic, they will not try to stick the knife in the back of the president. During an interview, JD Vance commented on the strained Trump and Musk relationship since the former introduced "Big Beautiful Bill.""He's obviously got a complicated relationship right now with, with the Trump White House, though. My argument to Elon is like, you're not going to be on the left, right? Even if you wanted to be. And he doesn't. They're not going to have you back. That, that, that ship has sailed. And so I really think it's a mistake for him to try to break from the president. So my hope is that by the time of the midterms, he's kind of come back into the fold.," Vance said.What 'Kayakgate'? JD Vance Goes Fishing In UK, Unbothered By Ohio River ScandalJokingly, Vance said that maybe Musk would not take his call. But seconds later he said he is joking and added thatthe drama around Tesla chiefand Trumpin the White House over the last couple of months is still going on and hoped that this to cool down. Vance also said that Musk hadhelped Republicans in winningthe election. Recalling the president's remarks he said that Trump even said it isall Musk'sfrustration."My attitude is I try to sort of been pretty big ten about this stuff. Like, if you're patriotic, you're not trying to stick your knife in the back of the president, you're not trying to betray the movement. I don't care about these minor little disagreements and issues. We have to kind of win with the whole movement together. And that's kind of the attitude that I try to take," he added. Trump-Musk falloutThis escalation ignited after Musk blasted Trump’s flagship spending and tax bill — a measure that gutted clean energy incentives and electric vehicle subsidies. For Musk, whose empire runs on EV dreams, battery futures, and hefty federal contracts, the bill was betrayal by spreadsheet. Trump hit back with characteristic menace, suggesting SpaceX, Tesla, and Starlink only exist because of Washington’s generosity. “Without subsidies,” he said, “Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa.”  As if the feud needed more reality-TV energy, Steve Bannon jumped in, branding Musk a “dangerous alien” and hinting at nationalising SpaceX to “protect American interests.” To Bannon, who views the world through a civilisational siege lens, Musk isn’t a heroic immigrant innovator — he’s a techno-libertarian Trojan horse undermining nationalist economics. Musk fired back instantly, calling Bannon “a traitor to reason,” and floated resurrecting his teased “America Party” to challenge the Republican old guard. He knows that in the digital age, controlling platforms like X is more powerful than controlling Fox News. His threat wasn’t idle bravado; it was a signal to technocrats, crypto die-hards, suburban engineers, and Silicon Valley libertarians that he could mount an ideological insurrection against Trumpian populism.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

He aims to eradicate crime, homelessness, and improve the capital's physical condition, establishing a task force for safety and beauty. Trump pledges to remove homeless individuals and incarcerate criminals, promising swift action and comparing it to border enforcement success.  US President Donald Trump on Sunday blasted the Federal Reserve’s ongoing headquarters renovations, ahead of a Monday press conference where he plans to address “crime and the beautification” of Washington, D.C. The event is set to address the eradication of "Crime, Murder and Death" in the nation’s capital. It will also focus on "Cleanliness and the General Physical Renovation and Condition of our once beautiful and well-maintained Capital." In his post, Trump criticised the expenditure on the renovation of the Federal Reserve building in Washington, D.C. He said, "We are not going to allow people to spend Rs 25,730 crore on fixing up a building, like the Federal Reserve, which could have been done in a far more elegant and time sensitive manner for Rs 416 to 833 crore." He added, "The Renovation would have actually been better, and would have saved Rs 248 crore, Traffic James and never-ending Construction."Trump's remark came after two 15-year-old boys were arrested on Monday in Washington, D.C., for unarmed carjacking and assaulting former Department of Govt Efficiency staffer Edward Coristine, also known as “Big Balls.”The arrests prompted federal law enforcement to increase patrols across the city. President Trump has mentioned the idea of federalising the city to combat excessive crime, despite crime rates in the nation’s capital being at a 30-year low.In response to the incident, he signed an executive order establishing a task force dedicated to making D.C. “safe and beautiful.”Earlier, on Sunday, Trump pledged to remove all homeless individuals from the capital and incarcerate criminals in an effort to “take our Capital back,” citing a significant rise in crime.In a post on his Truth Social account, Trump stated, “We want our Capital BACK. The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY. We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don't have to move out. We're going to put you in jail where you belong.” He further added, “This will be easier — Be prepared! There will be no ‘MR. NICE GUY,’” noting that more details would be revealed at a news conference on Monday. “It's all going to happen very fast, just like the Border. We went from millions pouring in, to ZERO in the last few months,” he added, referring to the crackdown by immigration and customs enforcements on illegal immigrants in the nation.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Israel-Gaza war: Five Al Jazeera journalists killed in Israeli strike; IDF claims one of correspondents served as 'terrorist cell leader in Hamas'
An Israeli strike near Gaza City's Al-Shifa Hospital resulted in the deaths of at least five Al Jazeera journalists, including correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh and camera operators. The IDF confirmed targeting Al Jazeera correspondent Anas al-Sharif, alleging he was a Hamas terrorist operative, a claim Al Jazeera denies.

The IDF confirmed targeting Al Jazeera correspondent Anas al-Sharif, alleging he was a Hamas terrorist operative, a claim Al Jazeera denies.  Five Al Jazeera journalists, including well-known correspondent Anas al-Sharif, were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a journalists’ tent in Gaza City on Sunday. The Israeli military confirmed it carried out the strike, accusing al-Sharif of being a Hamas operative who “posed as a journalist” and led a terrorist cell responsible for rocket attacks.Al Jazeera condemned the killings as a “targeted assassination” aimed at silencing independent reporting from Gaza, where international media access remains heavily restricted. The strike marks one of the deadliest incidents for the network since the war began nearly two years ago, during which over 200 media workers have been killed, according to press freedom groups.Gaza: Al Jazeera Staff Killed In Relentless IDF Bombardment, Journo’s Final Message Reveals HorrorThe journalists killed in the Gaza City strikeAl Jazeera confirmed that five of its staff died in the attack: correspondent Anas al-Sharif, fellow reporter Mohammed Qreiqeh, and camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal, and Moamen Aliwa. Also read: Journalist or Terrorist? Who was Anas al-Sharif? Al Jazeera reporter killed in Israeli strikeThe group had been sheltering in a tent opposite Al-Shifa Medical Complex, a site long used by media crews. Al-Sharif, 28, was one of the most recognisable Arabic-language reporters covering the conflict, known for his frontline reports from northern Gaza. Hours before his death, he posted footage on X showing nearby Israeli strikes. The killings have deepened concerns about journalist safety in Gaza, where local reporters provide most coverage due to the ban on foreign press entering without Israeli military escort.'A press badge isn’t a shield for terrorism'In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described Anas al-Sharif as a “Hamas terrorist” who used journalism as cover. They claimed intelligence from Gaza — including rosters, training records, and salary documents — proved his affiliation. According to the IDF, al-Sharif led a Hamas cell responsible for organising rocket attacks on Israeli civilians and troops. “A press badge isn’t a shield for terrorism,” the statement read. The military also accused Al Jazeera of integrating Hamas operatives into its reporting teams. Israel has long accused the Qatar-based network of bias, while Al Jazeera says such claims are politically motivated attempts to justify attacks on its journalists.Al Jazeera’s condemnation and call for accountabilityAl Jazeera condemned the attack as a “blatant and premeditated assault” on press freedom. The network accused Israel of deliberately targeting its journalists following repeated incitement by Israeli officials. It said the slain reporters were among the last to remain in Gaza, providing live, unfiltered accounts of the humanitarian crisis. The broadcaster warned that the killings were part of a wider campaign to “silence the truth” about the war. Calling for urgent international action, Al Jazeera argued that immunity for perpetrators fuels further attacks and urged governments to pressure Israel to halt the targeting of media workers.CPJ and media watchdogs reactThe Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said it was “appalled” by the deaths, warning that Israel’s practice of branding reporters as militants without public evidence raises “serious questions about its respect for press freedom.” CPJ Regional Director Sara Qudah stressed that journalists are civilians and must never be targeted. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) noted that over 200 journalists have been killed in Gaza since the war began, making it one of the deadliest conflicts for media in recent decades. Both organisations called for an independent investigation into the strike and for the protection of reporters working in conflict zones.Tensions between Israel and Al JazeeraIsrael and Al Jazeera have had a strained relationship for years. The Israeli government has banned the broadcaster from operating inside the country, accused it of incitement, and raided its offices. The latest war in Gaza has heightened tensions, with Al Jazeera frequently challenging Israeli narratives about military operations. Qatar, which funds the network, also hosts the political leadership of Hamas and has mediated indirect talks between Israel and the group. Critics say this fuels Israeli mistrust of the channel, while supporters argue it remains one of the few outlets providing on-the-ground coverage from Gaza.Gaza’s media vacuumWith Gaza sealed off from most international journalists, global news organisations rely heavily on local reporters like al-Sharif for coverage. These journalists face extreme danger, lacking the protection afforded to embedded foreign correspondents. Many live under constant bombardment, while also coping with shortages of food, water, and medical care. The deaths of prominent figures such as al-Sharif further diminish the flow of independent reporting from the enclave. UN agencies and rights groups have warned that the loss of these voices leaves the world reliant on official statements and severely limits scrutiny of military actions.Netanyahu’s defence of new military offensiveBefore the strike, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed foreign media, defending Israel’s expanded military operations in Gaza. He insisted Israel must “finish the job” by dismantling Hamas strongholds, not only in Gaza City but also in the central refugee camps and Muwasi. Netanyahu promised “safe zones” for civilians, though similar areas have been bombed in the past. He also announced plans to bring more foreign journalists into Gaza under military supervision. Critics, including the UN, warned that the expansion risks worsening the humanitarian disaster in the territory, which is already facing severe food shortages and mass displacement.International reaction at the UN Security CouncilThe UN Security Council held an emergency meeting after Netanyahu’s announcement, but no concrete action was agreed. The United States defended Israel’s right to act against Hamas, rejecting allegations of genocide. China condemned the “collective punishment” of Gaza’s population, while Russia warned against a “reckless intensification” of hostilities. UN humanitarian official Ramesh Rajasingham said starvation was already occurring, with conditions “beyond horrific.” Rights groups argue that targeting journalists undermines transparency and accountability in such a crisis, making independent reporting all the more crucial.Civilian toll and humanitarian crisisGaza’s health ministry reports more than 61,000 Palestinians killed since the war began, with roughly half being women and children. The conflict has displaced the majority of Gaza’s population and driven parts of the territory into famine. The ministry says at least 100 children and 117 adults have died from malnutrition-related causes since June. Aid delivery remains chaotic, with incidents of gunfire reported near distribution sites. Israel denies pursuing a policy of starvation, blaming shortages on Hamas. Humanitarian agencies say access restrictions and ongoing fighting are preventing sufficient relief efforts.Calls for justice Palestinian officials, press freedom advocates, and humanitarian organisations have called for the killings of al-Sharif and his colleagues to be investigated as war crimes. They argue the strike fits a broader pattern of silencing journalists who document alleged abuses. Al Jazeera says its slain reporters embodied the “courage and resilience” of Gaza’s press, working despite personal risk to expose the war’s impact. As the conflict nears its second year, the network warns that without independent witnesses, the humanitarian crisis will unfold largely unseen — and those responsible will face even less scrutiny.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

This shooting was one of three separate incidents reported within less than three hours in the same South Austin neighborhood.The first shooting occurred just before 2.48 am on North La Cross Avenue. Police officers responding to reports of gunfire found six people suffering from gunshot wounds.A 22-year-old woman was shot in the back and rushed to Mt Sinai Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Her name has not been released, according to ABC News.Among the injured were two 18-year-old boys, a 17-year-old boy, a 29-year-old man, and a 29-year-old woman. One of the 18-year-olds was shot in the chest and left arm and is in critical condition at Stroger Hospital. The 17-year-old suffered a gunshot wound to the left thigh and was also listed in critical condition at Mt Sinai Hospital.Another 18-year-old sustained a graze wound to his left hand and was treated at the scene. The 29-year-old man was shot in the right leg and remains in critical condition at Loretto Hospital. The 29-year-old woman was wounded in the right elbow and was taken to Rush Hospital in good condition.Approximately an hour before the North La Cross Avenue shooting, police responded to reports of shots fired about a block away on North Lamon Avenue. There, they found a 20-year-old woman with multiple gunshot wounds to her arm. She was also taken to the same hospital and was reported to be in good condition. No arrests have been made.Later, around 4.37 am, roughly three blocks from the first mass shooting, an 18-year-old boy was shot in the back and later died at Stroger Hospital. Another 18-year-old boy was also shot in the arm during the same incident. Police said the two teenagers were shot following an argument with a gunman who fired from a vehicle, as reported by ABC News. No arrests have been announced.Authorities have not confirmed whether these three shootings are connected. The motive behind the attacks remains under investigation.These violent events come less than a day after a mass shooting at an outdoor gathering in Baltimore, Maryland, where one person was killed and five others—including a 5-year-old girl—were wounded. The motive in that case is also under investigation.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

He made this post on his Truth Social account while traveling from the White House to his golf course in Virginia. He saw people lying homeless and immediately passed the order. Trump also promised to send federal officers to arrest criminals in the capital, even though official police numbers show violent crime is at its lowest in more than 30 years.President Donald Trump orders homeless to leave Washington DC immediatelyDonald Trump’s post on Truth Social included four photos taken from his motorcade. Two pictures showed about 10 tents on the grass near a highway ramp a little over a mile from the White House. Another showed a person sleeping on the steps of a building on Constitution Avenue. One more photo showed a road with some litter near the Kennedy Center.In his post, Donald Trump wrote, “We will give you places to stay, but far from the Capital.” He said the target was to improve the safety and cleanliness of Washington DC. Moreover, he revealed that he would address crime prevention and city cleanup at a news conference on Monday at 10 a.Donald Trump has already sent hundreds of federal agents to patrol Washington DC. But the Metropolitan Police Department says violent crime in 2024 dropped 35% compared to 2023, and is down another 26% in 2025 so far.Also Read: “More Than Any American Culture”: Martina Navratilova Once Shared How Chris Evert’s Catholic Upbringing Shaped Her Tennis ImageMayor Muriel Bowser and Eleanor Holmes Norton challenge Donald Trump’s eviction planWashington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser told MSNBC that there is no crime wave in the city. “We have been driving down violent crime for two years,” she said, adding that the current numbers are the lowest in decades.Eleanor Holmes Norton, the city’s nonvoting delegate in Congress, called Trump’s words “misguided and offensive” to the more than 700,000 residents of Washington DC. She said locals are “worthy and capable” of running their own city without interference from federal officials.The Free DC movement has planned a protest to happen at the same time as Trump’s Monday news conference.Legal experts say Trump may only control federal land and buildings in Washington DC.

Senator Lindsey Graham said every country buying Russian oil and keeping President Vladimir Putin's war machine will have to pay a heavy price, like India. During an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press, Graham said he played golf with President Donald Trump yesterday. "Saturday was the ten-day deadline. China is very much on his mind. He can tell you the top five oil purchasers of Ukrainian oil. He knows who they are. And if this doesn't end well with Putin, everybody buying Russian oil and keeping his war machine going in Russia, you're going to pay a heavy price like India," Graham said. "I am here to tell you that President Trump will end this war in a way to prevent a third invasion and not to entice China to take Taiwan. We're not out to humiliate Putin, we're out to get a deal to make sure there's no third invasion," Graham said. The US senator said Trump spoke to him a lot about China and also about two other countries that buy Russian oil. Graham said Putin does not care about the sanctions and he evades them. Putin does not care how many Russians die but the only thing that he cares about is his customers. "Putin could give a damn about sanctions. He evades them. He could give a damn about how many Russians die. The one thing that he can't tolerate and live with, if we go after his customers. The whole goal is to crush his customers, India, and China, and Brazil. That if you keep buying Putin's oil and prop up his war machine, you will be denied access to our economy. This is a new strategy. Trump is all in in terms of going after Putin's customers if we can't end this well. Without oil and gas revenue, Russia collapses," Graham said. Graham also revealed that the US. is listening to European allies ahead of a much-publicized meeting between Trump and Putin in Alaska this week, saying: "I think everybody knows that how this war ends can be a good thing or a bad thing.""If it ends in a way that looks like that Putin is overly rewarded, there goes Taiwan," Graham said. "You can't end a war without talking. I do hope that Zelensky can be part of the process. I'll leave that up to the White House."About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

(Photo: DailyEcho/Padharo) Ankit Vaghela, an Indian-origin restaurant owner in Southampton, was told by the police that they could not come to his 'Padharo' when he called 999 to report a break-in. The vandals broke in and fled with several bottles of expensive alcohol and cash but the police helpline asked them to email the CCTV footage of the three burglars who broke in last week.Vaghela decided to get proactive and review the footage first. He discovered his cash register without the cash, abandoned along with some smashed liquor bottles strewn on a nearby road. “It was very heartbreaking to be told that officers will be able to review the damage in three to five working days and that no forensics was available at the time,” said Vaghela.“There was glass everywhere. As a business, we can’t afford to remain closed and had to get things cleaned up and the glass fixed. We are still struggling to operate smoothly without a proper cash register, which will take time, but are determined to welcome our guests with the same level of service we are known for in the city,” he said.The Hampshire Police said they did not underestimate the July 31 case but they understood that their investigation could start without their immediate attendance at the site, as the offenders were not there. “Every deployment decision is based on informed risk assessments to make sure the most serious cases are prioritised, and officers are on scene where there is an immediate threat to life or a crime in action,” the police force said in a statement.“On this occasion, based on the initial information we were given regarding the offenders no longer being at the scene, our investigation could get underway without any immediate attendance. That investigation is progressing with lines of enquiry identified, such as CCTV, and we are in touch with the victim to provide them updates on our investigation,” added the statement, along with an appeal to the public for any information related to the burglary."It means nothing now, the damage is done. Officers were not willing to visit the restaurant," Vaghela told to local news outlets.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

In a separate incident, Laxman Das, an Indian sous chef in Dublin, was attacked and robbed while going to work. These incidents follow a series of recent assaults targeting Indians in Ireland, raising concerns about racism.  TOI correspondent from London: A six-year-old Indian-origin girl and an Indian sous chef are the latest victims in the ongoing spate of racist attacks targeting Indian nationals and Indian-origin Irish people in Ireland.The girl, whose family hail from Kottayam, Kerala, was playing outside her house in Waterford City, southeast Ireland, with friends at 7.30pm on Monday evening when a gang of boys and one girl called her a “dirty Indian” and told her to “go back to India”. She was born in Ireland. Five of the gang also punched her in the face, hit her private parts with a bicycle, punched her neck and twisted her hair.Her mother moved to Ireland eight years ago from Kottayam to work as a nurse with her husband and recently became an Irish citizen.The mother said the gang was made up of boys aged 12 to 14 and a girl aged eight. She said her daughter came home in floods of tears and is now too scared to play outside. She told the Irish Mirror: “I never expected that such an incident would happen. I thought she would be safe here. Even in front of our own house she can’t play safely. I am a nurse, I am doing my best to take care of people. I do my work and I am 100% professional. I changed my citizenship, but still we are called dirty people and even my kids are not safe. We came here to fill a labour gap. We are professionals — we have all the certificates…”The mother studied BSc Nursing at University of Calicut and went to Mount Carmel Higher Secondary School in Kottayam.“Gardaí (Irish national police) responded to a report of an alleged assault in the Kilbarry area of Waterford city on the evening of Monday 4 August. Investigations are ongoing,” a Garda spokesperson told TOI.On Wednesday morning Laxman Das from Kolkata, who works as a sous chef at the Anantara The Marker Dublin hotel, was assaulted near the Hilton Hotel by three people while on his way to work. He was taken to St Vincent's University Hospital. His phone, cash and electric bike were stolen.These come following a spate of attacks against Indians in Ireland in recent weeks — on July 19, July 24, July 27, and on Aug 1 when a cab driver was assaulted.The Gardaí said they are still investigating these attacks and no one has been arrested.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning looks of Binny Sebastiantv10 baby names that mean ‘divine light’ or ‘sacred glow’Lifestyle10 Birds with the "wildest dating rituals"LifestyleRaksha Bandhan: 10 iconic lines of famous Hindi poets that capture essence of the festivalLifestyleKarishma Tanna Stuns with Style and SpiritEntertainmentFrom Moong to Chia Sprouts: How to grow your breakfast in balconyLifestyleBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Here’s how much each contestant earns dailytv10 creatures that survive in the deepest parts of the oceanLifestyleRaksha Bandhan: 10 quotes that describe the beautiful bond between brothers and sistersLifestyleHow to do step-by-step Ayurveda hair therapy at homeLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Threads of Love, Threads of Tradition: How different Indian states celebrate Raksha BandhanFrom chapatis to cake: 7 delicious ways to use overripe bananasInternational Cat Day 2025: From Persian to Bengal Cat-- 5 most beautiful and popular pet cat breeds in the world5 diseases moles on your body might indicate and should not be ignoredNot-so popular drinks that help in weightloss10 places in South Africa that aren’t to be missed in a lifetimeMemorable style outings of Princess CharlotteHow Kangana Ranaut turned fame into fearless politicsFrom ₹6 Lakh to ₹40 Lakh: A peek into Kamal Haasan’s ultra-luxe watch closetFrom Archana reacting to a hate comment to son Aaryamann revealing how he impressed girlfriend Yogita Bihani: Archana Puran Singh shares candid moments123Hot PicksGlobal Standard indexUS stocks todayIndia-US tariffIntel CEOMukesh AmbaniUS jobless dataRussia crude oilTop TrendingTom BradyDonald TrumpSouth Park EpisodeCall of DutyMalik BeasleyBattlefield 6 Beta OpensPrivate School in IndianaLuka Doncic Weight LossLinda McMahonLakers RumorsTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteUAE launches national programme to train Emiratis in space mission design and satellite engineering'PM Modi can't, shouldn't bend knee to Donald Trump': US tariffs on India draws rare bipartisan concern in US - watch'Enormous mistake': What Trump's former NSA John Bolton said on India tariffChild assault under false identity: Indian man commits suicide in US jail months after 35-year prison sentence, claim reportsLove gone wild: Indian man faces deportation for harassing UK zoo colleague for 6 months; didn’t stop even after restraining order'Before judging...': Wife of Pakistani man Salman Iftikhar who threatened Virgin Atlantic air hostess with gangrape defends outburstFriedrich Merz halts German military exports to Israel over Gaza issue; urges aid accessGround invasion in Gaza?

The arrest occurred due to possession of a fake resident card. Authorities took him into custody in Niagara Falls, New York. He faces a potential 10-year prison sentence. The arrest is part of 'Operation Take Back America'. This initiative targets illegal immigration.  An Indian national has been arrested in the United States for allegedly possessing a forged alien resident card, according to the Justice Department. Swapnil Ramesh Tejale, 34, was taken into custody following a traffic stop in Niagara Falls, New York, and now faces a federal charge that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.“On July 10, 2025, the Niagara Falls Border Patrol Station received a request from the Niagara Falls Police Department to help identify three individuals that they had encountered during a traffic stop,” said Assistant US Attorney Michael J. Smith, who is prosecuting the case. “Agents arrived at the scene and questioned the three individuals as to their citizenship. Tejale presented a Lawful Permanent Resident Card but voluntarily admitted that the card was fictitious.”Authorities later confirmed that Tejale was in the country unlawfully and did not possess any valid immigration documents. Following his arrest, agents discovered a Social Security card in his name, which was also found to be counterfeit.The case falls under “Operation Take Back America”, a Justice Department initiative aimed at tackling illegal immigration and dismantling transnational criminal organisations. The operation seeks to “repel the invasion of illegal immigration” and “protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime”, the department said.The investigation was led by the US Border Patrol Niagara Falls Station, under the direction of Patrol Agent in Charge Brady Waikal.Tejale’s arrest is part of a series of immigration enforcement actions involving Indian nationals this year. In a related incident, an Indian man from Santa Rosa, California, was sentenced in March to six months in prison for conspiracy to transport aliens for profit. Meanwhile, Manjot Singh, a 25-year-old Indian national, was recently arrested in the Seattle area for repeat offences including robbery, assault, and criminal impersonation. Singh, who entered the U.S. illegally, is currently in ICE custody pending deportation.ICE officials have said that Singh’s arrest is a warning to repeat offenders: “Those who violate US laws while in the country illegally face arrest and deportation.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Viral footage shows firefighters inspecting the scene as the family performed the ritual. (Photo: X) A housewarming ceremony involving a Hindu havan at a Texas home took an unexpected turn when local firefighters arrived at the scene, mistaking the ritual for a fire emergency.The incident was captured on video. The footage has gone viral and has fuelled an online debate over cultural awareness and fire safety. The clip was originally shared on Instagram. It shows a fire truck from the Bedford fire department pulling up outside the house as smoke from the ceremony fills the garage. Inside, an Indian family can be seen performing a traditional havan, a religious ritual involving fire, as part of their housewarming puja.The video includes on-screen text stating, "Cultural misunderstanding 101: A Hindu puja is not a fire emergency. When you're having a housewarming havan and the fire department pulls up."Shortly after the fire crew arrives, they are seen speaking with members of the family and inspecting the area. However, it remains unclear whether any formal action was taken or if any fire codes were violated during the ritual.The footage has since been widely circulated across social media platforms, with users offering differing views on the incident. Some social media users criticised the family for conducting a ritual involving fire in a residential setting, arguing it could pose safety risks. Others defended the family’s right to observe their religious customs, calling the incident a clear example of cultural misunderstanding.No official comment was immeditaely released by the Bedford fire department.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Indian-origin Mathura Sridharan was appointed as Ohio's 12th solicitor general, inviting the wrath of online trolls who questioned why a 'non-US-origin' person was not picked for the post. Sridharan's LinkedIn went viral as critics questioned her credibility -- forcing Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost to issue a clarification, or a clapback at the trolls. Dave Yost, who announced Mathura's promotion, said Mathura is wrongly being portrayed as a non-American. "A few commenters have asserted incorrectly that Mathura is not American. She is a United States citizen, married to a US citizen, and the child of naturalized US citizens," he said. "If her name or her complexion bother you, the problem is not with her or her appointment," he added."Mathura is brilliant… she won her argument at SCOTUS last year. Both the SGs she worked under (Flowers & Gaiser) recommended her. I told her when I originally hired her I needed her to argue with me. She does… All the time! Excited to promote her. She will serve Ohio well," Yost wrote.Yost's clapback also met trolling as people commented that she is not "American-American". "Is she a Christian? That’s the biggest factor that concerns me. Based on the bindi on her forehead, I worry she is not," one wrote. "Another American job… given away to foreigners," another wrote. "She's Indian. They all have a loyalty first to other Indians. horrible pick. Totally un-American. the GOP is pathetic," a third user wrote."No one with the last name 'Sridharan' fought in the US Civil War. She's not an American," another wrote.Before joining the Ohio Solicitor’s Office, Mathura clerked for Judge Steven J. Menashi of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and Judge Deborah A. Batts of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. She holds a Juris Doctor from New York University School of Law, a Master’s Degree in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as a Bachelor’s Degree in Economics and in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

News organizations like New Zealand Herald, Radio New Zealand, and 1News cited their inability to moderate the hateful content as the reason for shutting down comments.   After Indian-origin Nikhil Ravishankar was appointed as the new chief executive of Air New Zealand, the country's media said they had to disable comments on social media as there was a barrage of racist remarks targeting Ravishankar's ethnicity. Ravishankar was the chief digital officer of Air New Zealand before getting the major promotion which is the first for an Indian-origin person in the country.New Zealand Herald, Radio New Zealand, 1News said they had to disable comments as they can't allow hatred. The New Zealand Herald issued a statement in which it clarified that there were several racist comments owing to which they had to take the extreme step. "We appreciate the high level of interest in this story but cannot safely moderate it at this time," the news outlet said in a post in the comment thread."We want to foster a safe online community by reducing instances of hate, racism, abuse and misinformation. We welcome your feedback on articles but there has to be some parameters, and these are explained in our community house rules...We cannot tolerate hate. We cannot tolerate abuse towards individuals in our stories or other commenters," the company's social media policy says. Radio New Zealand had to do the same on the social media post on Ravishankar's appointment. "Under RNZ's comments policy, we will proactively disable comments on posts which may attract abusive or harmful comments or when resources are required elsewhere," a spokesperson for RNZ said. "In this instance, the comments were disabled after our monitoring found racist comments," the spokesperson said. "We want people to feel safe and respected on our community forums and will continue to proactively disable comments where necessary. We will not tolerate harmful communications."1News said it received a large number of comments on the post that announced Ravishankar's appointment and a vast majority were inappropriate. Who is Nikhil Ravishankar?Nikhil Ravishankar was born in India but brought up in New Zealand. He studied in New Zealand -- holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) from the University of Auckland. Before joining Air New Zealand, Ravishankar was Chief Digital Officer at Vector New Zealand (from 2017), and also worked as a Managing Director at Accenture across Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand, and in senior technology roles at Spark (formerly Telecom NZ).About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

After her TikTok video went viral, another ICE official offered help. Chatterjee highlights the broader issue of poor ICE communication, impacting immigrants facing detention and difficult bond policies, leading some to abandon their asylum claims. Trisha Chatterjee (Picture source: LinkedIn) Trisha Chatterjee, an Indian-origin immigration lawyer in Ohio, has alleged she was given the number of a Taco Bell outlet when she called ICE for urgent client support. Chatterjee posted about the incident on TikTok, where it went viral and ultimately led to help from another ICE official. But she says the larger issue lack of clear access to immigration authorities continues to cause serious harm to her clients."I called and they answered and they said, 'Hello, Taco Bell?' And I said, 'Taco Bell?' And the guy who was working said, 'Yeah, Taco Bell. Ma'am, you called me," Chatterjee recalled."I was in such disbelief," she said. "So, I called the ICE officer back, just really frustrated with what had just happened. He says, 'Oh, I'm sorry. I was trying to lighten the mood and make you laugh.'"ICE has denied the accusation. Homeland security called it a “lie and a smear.” Chatterjee stood by her version of events.Who is Trisha Chatterjee? Trisha Chatterjee is an Indian-origin immigration lawyer based in Greater Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio. She graduated from Miami University in 2020 and the University of Dayton School of Law in 2023.She works with the law office of Emily Feliz Garcia, a small immigration firm in Springdale. Before this, she worked at Abdallah law offices.For the last two years, she has handled immigration cases, especially those involving clients detained at the Butler County Jail in Ohio, which has a contract with ICE.Chatterjee was trying to submit "stay of removal" applications—urgent paperwork that can pause deportation for clients with pending immigration cases. ICE requires these to be submitted in person at the Detroit field office, but she hoped to file them locally in Blue Ash.After being unable to reach anyone by phone or email, she finally spoke to an ICE officer who gave her a phone number that turned out to be for Taco Bell. When she called back, the officer reportedly said he was trying to make her laugh.She posted a video about the incident on TikTok, which gained over 38,000 views. Many users sympathised, and one even helped her connect with a helpful ICE official in Blue Ash, who is now assisting her.Chatterjee said the larger problem is the lack of access and communication with ICE. She also highlighted how a stricter bond policy is making it harder for immigrants to stay out of detention during legal proceedings. Bonds can cost up to $50,000 and must be paid upfront.According to Chatterjee, some clients are abandoning their asylum cases or choosing to self-deport out of fear. She mentioned recent local arrests of people attending ICE check-ins, which has only deepened anxiety in immigrant communities.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Both Bhagwagar and Powell are being held at the Martinez detention facility. Bhagwagar’s bail has been set at $15 million.The charges in both cases carry possible prison terms of 15 years to life. Bhagwagar is expected to be arraigned Wednesday in Martinez, California.“Our office stands firmly committed to protecting children and holding those who cause harm accountable,” said Contra Costa county district attorney Diana Becton in a statement. “Every child deserves to feel safe, protected and heard when an injustice like this occurs.”According to the Contra Costa county sheriff’s office, detectives had been investigating Bhagwagar since April. His arrest was made with the assistance of Homeland Security Investigations after a warrant was issued.A short video published by aviation blog View From the Wing shows officers with badges exiting the plane’s cockpit.Delta Air Lines released a statement saying it was “appalled by reports of the charges related to the arrest” and confirmed that Bhagwagar had been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation. “Delta has zero tolerance for unlawful conduct,” the airline said.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani faces criticism for visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam due to his past support for defunding the police. Critics accuse Mamdani of shifting his stance for political gain, especially after his 2020 tweets resurfaced. Mamdani defends his actions, clarifying his current position on public safety and police funding. Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is facing backlash after visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam, as critics pointed to his past 2020 tweet supporting "defund the police" stance.The controversy erupted after Mamdani, who recently returned from a trip to Uganda, visited the grieving family of officer Islam, one of four victims killed in a mass shooting in Midtown Manhattan. Zohran Mamdani’s SECRET Wedding Triggers Fury Amid Local Tragedy | WATCHThe shooter, Shane Tamura, opened fire on Monday, killing Islam and three others before shooting himself.Sharing a post on X, Mamdani wrote: “Two days ago, an act of senseless violence took the lives of Officer Didarul Islam, Wesley LePatner, Aland Etienne, and Julia Hyman. Today, I visited Officer Islam's family and learned of his legacy. I ask you to join me in honoring the memory of these four New Yorkers.”However, the post quickly drew criticism, with users referencing Mamdani’s previous tweets during the height of the “Defund the Police” movement in 2020.Many accused him of changing his stance for political gain. One user wrote, “You can't go from defund the police to never mind I love the police. You're asking New Yorkers to forgo their guns meanwhile you just had a wedding in Uganda with armed guards.”While another posted, “Zohran Mamdani exposed as a total fraud. Mocking cops, calling them racist, then acting like he cares? No loyalty to America. He belongs in Uganda, not leading NYC. Deport him and protect our city!”Earlier at a press conference following his visit to the officer’s home in The Bronx, Mamdani addressed the criticism and attempted to clarify his position saying: “I am not defunding the police; I am not running to defund the police.”“Over the course of this race, I’ve been very clear about my view of public safety and the critical role that the police have in creating that public safety,” he added.Standing alongside members of the Bangladeshi American Police Association—of which Officer Islam was a member—and labor union 32BJ, which represented another victim, Aland Etienne, Mamdani tried to strike a unifying tone.During the peak of the "Defund the Police" movement in 2020, Zohran Mamdani repeatedly called for major cuts to the NYPD budget. In one post, he wrote, “We don’t need an investigation to know that the NYPD is racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety. What we need is to #DefundTheNYPD.”In another, he said, “There is no negotiating with an institution this wicked & corrupt. Defund it. Dismantle it. End the cycle of violence,” referencing budget talks around proposed NYPD cuts.Now, Mamdani has distanced himself from those remarks. When asked about them, he responded, “My statements in 2020 were made amidst a frustration that many New Yorkers held at the murder of George Floyd.”Mamdani claimed that his current stance is more nuanced, stating that his previous posts were “clearly out of step” with his recent campaign platform. He now supports maintaining the NYPD headcount while reducing its overtime budget.Despite this clarification, skepticism remains. Many police officers and political observers have accused Mamdani of shifting positions purely for political gain in a city where public safety remains a top concern for voters, New York Post reported.Adding to the political firestorm, former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams, who are both trailing Mamdani in early polling for the 2025 mayoral race, weighed in shortly after the shooting. Mamdani fired back, accusing Cuomo of politicising the tragedy saying, “It is beyond me that politicians are looking to use these days to score such cynical political points, on the very day that I held the father of Officer Islam in my arms and he could not utter a single word.”“For the former governor to spend an entire day speaking almost exclusively about me and barely about the New Yorkers who have been killed is indicative of the very politics New Yorkers want to leave in the past,” he added.All three, Mamdani, Cuomo, and Adams are expected to attend officer Islam’s funeral on Thursday.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The high court found him guilty of rape and outrage of modesty, following incidents at his Jurong West shop in 2021. Despite his denials and claims of erectile dysfunction, the judge deemed the victim's testimony credible.  An Indian national was sentenced to more than 14 years in jail on Thursday by the Singapore high court for sexually assaulting a minor, reports the Straits Times.Ramalingam Selvasekaran was handed a sentence of 14 years, three months and two weeks after being found guilty of rape and two counts of outrage of modesty after assaulting an 11-year-old at his provision shop in Jurong West.According to the court, the assaults occurred between 4.50 pm and 5.05 pm on October 28, 2021. The girl had visited Ramalingam’s store and returned later to buy ice cream. Prosecutors said he led her into a back area and forced her to perform oral sex. After the incident, the girl sought help from a passerby, who called the police.Ramalingam represented himself during the trial, which began on January 16. He was convicted on all charges on 7 July.“The fact that she had not run off after the first act of molest, or that she did not resist the assaults, or inform her grandfather, were all to my mind sufficiently explained, particularly given that she was still young and immature,” said Justice Aidan Xu, who found the girl’s account credible and consistent.Ramalingam’s earlier statements to police reportedly included admissions of hugging, kissing, and oral sex. However, he later denied any wrongdoing, claiming he was suffering from erectile dysfunction and that no DNA evidence was found on the victim.The judge ruled that these claims did not undermine the girl’s testimony. “While there was no dispute that Ramalingam suffered from erectile dysfunction, the prosecution’s expert witness gave a cogent explanation that oral rape remained possible,” Justice Xu was quoted as saying to Straits Times.Following sentencing on July 30, Ramalingam said he would appeal and was granted bail of S$80,000. He attempted to negotiate with the judge over the conditions, asking for the removal of his electronic tag and exemption from reporting to the Police Cantonment Complex. Both requests were denied.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The incidents, condemned by authorities and community leaders, are being treated as linked. This follows a separate racist assault in Adelaide, where an Indian man was brutally attacked after being told to "f--- off, Indian."  A Hindu temple in Melbourne’s eastern suburb of Boronia was defaced with racist graffiti this week prompting widespread condemnation and police investigation.As reported by The Brisbane Times and The Sydney Morning Herald, offensive red graffiti with the words “Go home” and other racial slurs were found daubed across the Shree Swaminarayan Temple on Wadhurst Drive, as well as two nearby Asian-operated restaurants Kingsland Chinese Restaurant and Charles King Dumpling.Police said a healing centre on Mountain Highway was also defaced the same night, bringing the total number of sites attacked to four. “There is absolutely no place at all in our society for hate-based and racist behaviour,” Victoria Police said in a statement. Authorities confirmed that all four incidents are being treated as linked and that an investigation is under way.PollShould harsher penalties be implemented for hate crimes?Yes, definitelyNo, current laws are sufficient'An attack on our right to worship'Makrand Bhagwat, President of the Hindu Council of Australia’s Victoria chapter, told Australia Today the vandalism of the temple was “heartbreaking” for the community. “Our temple is meant to be a sanctuary of peace, devotion and unity,” he said. “To have it targeted in this way feels like an attack on our identity, our right to worship and freedom of religion.”Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan sent a personal message of support to temple management. “What happened this week was hateful, racist and deeply disturbing,” she wrote. “It wasn’t just vandalism – it was a deliberate act of hate, designed to intimidate, isolate, and spread fear.”Local interfaith networks, including the City of Greater Knox’s Multifaith Network, have expressed support. “We want to show that love and solidarity triumph over hate,” said community leader Vikrant Thakur.Indian man targeted in racist attackThis came after a 23-year-old Indian man, Charanpreet Singh, was brutally attacked and left unconscious on a street in Adelaide following a reported racist assault linked to a parking dispute. According to 9News, the men allegedly told Singh to "f--- off, Indian" before launching a violent, unprovoked assault.“They just said ‘f--- off, Indian’, and after that they just started punching,” Singh said. “I tried to fight back, but they beat me until I was unconscious.”He sustained serious injuries, including brain trauma and facial fractures. A 20-year-old from Enfield was arrested and charged, but others involved remain at large.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Singh and his wife were allegedly ambushed by a group of men who shouted racial slurs before inflicting serious injuries. The incident has sparked outrage and renewed calls for enhanced safety measures for international students in the area.  An Indian international student has been hospitalised with serious injuries after a violent assault in Australia's Adelaide that is being investigated as a possible racially motivated attack. The incident has sparked outrage across the Indian community and renewed calls for better safety measures for international students.Charanpreet Singh, 23, was with his wife near Kintore Avenue on Saturday evening (July 19) when they were allegedly ambushed by a group of five men. According to Australia Today, the couple had just parked their car to view the city’s light displays around 9:22pm when the attackers emerged from another vehicle.Viral video shows assaultEyewitnesses and video footage shared on social media reportedly show the men striking Singh with what appeared to be metal knuckles or sharp objects, while shouting racial abuse including: “F--- off, Indian”. The attackers then fled the scene, leaving Singh unconscious and seriously injured on the road.PollWhat should be prioritized to improve safety for international students?Awareness campaigns and community supportStronger law enforcement and quicker actionSingh, who spoke to 9News from his hospital bed, said the altercation began over a car parking dispute but escalated into a racially charged assault. “They just said, ‘F--- off, Indian,’ and after that they just started punching,” he recalled. “You can change anything in your body, but you can’t change the colours.”He sustained facial fractures and brain trauma, and was taken by emergency services to the Royal Adelaide Hospital for overnight treatment. The assault has left members of the local Indian community shaken, with many expressing solidarity with Singh online.“When things like this happen, it makes you feel like you should go back,” Singh said.Police investigation under waySouth Australia Police confirmed they were called to Kintore Avenue shortly before 9.30pm and found Singh with facial injuries. “He was taken to hospital for treatment. Investigations are continuing,” a police spokesperson told The Indian Sun. One man, a 20-year-old from Enfield, has been arrested and charged with assault causing harm. The other suspects remain at large.Authorities are reviewing CCTV footage from the area and have urged witnesses to come forward. “We ask anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers,” the police said.Premier Peter Malinauskas has condemned the incident, calling it “completely unwelcome in our state”. He added, “Any time we see any evidence of any racial attack, it is just not consistent with where the majority of our community are at.”Another attack in DublinThis follows another attack targeting an Indian individual. An Indian man in his 40s was hospitalised after being brutally attacked by a group of teenage boys in a violent, racist assault in Dublin on Saturday evening. The gang falsely accused him of inappropriate behaviour with children before beating him and pulling down his trousers. “Gardaí in Tallaght were alerted to an incident at Parkhill Road... Investigations are ongoing,” police said. Councillor Baby Pereppadan said, “He couldn’t speak much because of the shock.” Sinn Féin’s Seán Crowe added, “You are sowing hate, fear, and division.” A protest is planned for July 26 to condemn rising racist violence in Ireland.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Her exit, surprising to many, opens an opportunity for the U.S. Treasury to propose a successor amidst global trade dynamic shifts. Gopinath, the first female chief economist, joined the IMF in 2019 and was promoted in 2022. Gita Gopinath (File photo) NEW DELHI: Gita Gopinath, the second-in-command at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), will step down at the end of August to return to her position at Harvard University, the IMF announced on Monday.The timing of Gita Gopinath’s exit has taken many within the IMF by surprise and is believed to have been prompted by her own decision, reported news agency Reuters. Having originally left Harvard to serve at the Fund, she is now set to resume her role as professor of economics at the university. Her departure opens a window for the US Treasury to propose a successor—an opportunity that comes as President Donald Trump pushes to reshape global trade dynamics and curb the country’s persistent trade deficits through sweeping tariffs on imports worldwide. Gopinath, who joined the IMF in 2019 as its first-ever female chief economist, was elevated to First Deputy Managing Director in January 2022. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva will appoint her successor “in due course,” the statement added.Gopinath had served as the first female chief economist of the Washington-based global lender for three years. Gopinath's research has been published in many top economics journals.

The case relates to the death of Piang Ngaih Don, a domestic worker from Myanmar, who died on July 26, 2016, from brain injuries caused by repeated blunt trauma. At the time of her death, she was severely malnourished, weighing just 24 kilograms.'Nothing Comes Free, Won't Stop...': Singapore PM's Big Announcement At Military EventAccording to Channel News Asia, Chelvam, who was Don’s legal employer, allowed her to be abused over several months by his ex-wife, Gaiyathiri Murugayan, and his mother-in-law, Prema S Narayanasamy. Murugayan and Narayanasamy are already serving 30-year and 17-year sentences, respectively, for their roles in the abuse.PollShould there be stricter laws against domestic abuse?Yes, absolutelyNo, current laws are enoughDistrict Judge Teoh Ai Lin noted Chelvam’s failure to intervene or protect Don, despite witnessing her deteriorating condition. He also removed the home’s CCTV recorder to conceal evidence and lied to investigators.Prosecutor Sean Teh said video footage showed Chelvam present during several episodes of abuse and accused him of supporting the starvation that contributed to Don’s death.Chelvam was acquitted on a fifth charge of using criminal force.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The suspects were arrested in connection with a kidnapping and torture case. The case involved an international Punjabi street gang. The gang is accused of running a brutal extortion racket. The racket stretches from California to murder plots in India. Authorities in California and the FBI are investigating eight Indian-origin suspects arrested in San Joaquin County for allegedly kidnapping and torturing a man as part of an international extortion scheme. The gang, led by Pavittar Singh, wanted in India for multiple murders, targeted Indian-Americans. JALANDHAR: Investigating the eight Indian-origin suspects arrested in San Joaquin County, California, on July 11, county authorities and FBI said the international Punjabi street gang kidnapped a local man, stripped him naked, and tortured him for hours as part of a brutal extortion racket that stretches from California'to murder plots in India.The authorities have urged Indian-Americas to report such extortion threats.Addressing a joint press conference, they revealed the gang leader, Pavittar Singh, was also wanted in India for multiple murders and firearms offences, including a killing in Batala, Punjab.Indian Student Handcuffed at Newark Airport in US to Be Deported; India Protests, Seeks ExplanationPollDo you think the involvement of international authorities is necessary in this case?Yes, it’s crucialNo, local authorities can handle itFBI also cited earlier US arrests of Indian gang leaders: Gurdev 'Jassal' Singh (RPG attacks), Harpreet Singh, also known as Happy Passia, Lawrence Bishnoi's brother Anmol , linked to the murder of singer Sidhu Moose Wala, and others.8 Indian-origin suspects face life in jail without bailEight suspects, led by Pavittar, now face charges of kidnapping for ransom, torture and illegal weapons that carry life sentences. A multi-agency SWAT sweep on July 11 had netted machine guns, an assault rifle, and $15,000 cash stashed in a ceiling vent.Sheriff Patrick Withrow said they were tipped off on June 21 about a horrendous crime that occurred on June 19 in the Manteca area. They contacted the victim and, on July 11, their AGNET Unit — alongside SWAT teams from FBI, Stockton police, Manteca police and Stanislaus County sheriff's office — executed five coordinated search warrants across the county and arrested the suspects. Withrow said the purpose of the torture was to extract names of other potential extortion targets in the Indian-American business community. Elaborating on the federal and international angle, Sid Patel from FBISacramento field office said Pavittar was wanted in India for firearm violations, assault and multiple murders abroad. He revealed six of the eight suspects were picked up by ICE ERO for immigration proceedings, and FBI was coordinating with India and Canada on extradition after US sentences.San Joaquin County District Attorney Ron Freitas told the press conference that they filed two complaints charging the eight men with serious gang-related crimes, including kidnapping, torture, extortion, witness intimidation, and multiple weapon violations. They said the suspects faced life in prison, with no bail and no exceptions.Apart from Pavitar, other members of the gang included Dilpreet Singh, Sarbjit Singh, Gurtaj Singh, Amritpall Singh, Vishal Singh, Arshpreet Singh, and Manpreet Randhawa. According to the sheriff and FBI, the gang operations included extortion of Indian-American business owners, forced free labour, violent truck cargo hijackings along Central Valley, weapons and drug trafficking, and international political violence (RPG attacks, assassinations, grenade assaults on police stations in India).Each of the accused faces a life-in-prison baseline for kidnapping for ransom, along with firearm and gang enhancements that could push to life without parole. The sheriff even said, "Suspects are animals with little or no regard for human life."Announcing the setting up of an anonymous tip line specifically for this case, the sheriff urged Indian-American residents to report extortion and intimidation attempts. "Help us hunt the rest of this gang — call us."About the AuthorIP SinghIP Singh is Senior Assistant Editor at The Times of India.

This happened after a $3 billion OpenAI acquisition fell through. The move upset investors and the public. Windsurf was later saved by Cognition. Mohan's actions sparked debate about loyalty. Despite the controversy, his contributions to AI are significant. He now works at Google DeepMind, shaping AI development.  Varun Mohan, a rising star in Silicon Valley and co-founder of AI startup Windsurf, is under fire after abruptly quitting to join Google’s DeepMind, effectively tanking a $3 billion acquisition deal with OpenAI. His sudden decision stunned colleagues and disrupted months of negotiations, raising questions about loyalty, corporate ethics, and the volatile nature of tech leadership. The move triggered widespread criticism from investors, industry peers, and the public, with some branding Mohan a “generational villain” for leaving his team behind during a crucial transition. While Windsurf was later rescued in a last-minute deal by Cognition, the controversy has cast a long shadow over Mohan’s once-admired career. But who is the man at the center of this high-stakes tech saga?Varun Mohan: Windsurf Co-founder with Indian rootsVarun Mohan was born and raised in Sunnyvale, California, to Indian immigrant parents. While the specific region in India remains undisclosed, his upbringing was defined by a blend of Indian cultural values and the American spirit of innovation. Encouraged to excel academically, Mohan showed an early aptitude for mathematics and computer science, regularly winning accolades in national Olympiads and competitions.Google Pixel 10 Series Launch: Everything Coming on August 20Mohan’s academic journey led him to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he pursued a rare dual-degree program. He completed a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). He specialized in areas like operating systems, machine learning, distributed computing, and algorithms, laying the groundwork for his future in AI infrastructure and developer tools.During his time at MIT, Mohan built his technical foundation with internships at major tech firms and research institutions, including Quora, LinkedIn, Samsung, Cloudera, and UC Santa Cruz. After graduating, he joined the self-driving startup Nuro, where he quickly rose to the role of Lead Software Engineer. These experiences gave him hands-on exposure to complex AI systems and real-world applications of machine learning.Co-founding Windsurf: Building an AI-native IDEIn 2021, Mohan co-founded Codeium, which was later rebranded as Windsurf, along with MIT classmate Douglas Chen. The company initially focused on GPU virtualization for deep learning but later pivoted to create Cascade, an AI-powered integrated development environment (IDE). The tool allowed developers to write, test, and refactor code with AI support, onboarding over a million users within just four months. Windsurf raised $243 million in funding and reached a $1.25 billion valuation, becoming one of the fastest-growing AI unicorns in the United States.Fallout from the Google moveIn 2025, OpenAI was reportedly in advanced talks to acquire Windsurf for $3 billion. But just as the deal neared completion, Mohan and Chen resigned and licensed Windsurf’s technology to Google in a $2.4 billion agreement. Mohan then joined Google DeepMind, taking key team members with him. The sudden departure left Windsurf in crisis and eventually prompted a weekend-long rescue operation by AI firm Cognition. The move sparked outrage across the tech world. Meanwhile, Twitter memes and LinkedIn rants turned Mohan into Silicon Valley’s most talked-about defector. Whether he’s a visionary or a villain, Varun Mohan has undeniably made his mark.Backlash from investors and the publicThe fallout was swift and public. Venture capitalist Vinod Khosla criticized Mohan for abandoning his team, while Cognition CEO Scott Wu called the exit a betrayal of founder responsibility. On social media, users accused Mohan of prioritizing personal gain over team loyalty. One post read, “Founders cashing out while the team’s left behind isn’t just bad form. It’s long-term reputation damage.” Another user bluntly called him a “generational villain.” Some industry experts suggest Mohan's move reflects the fiercely competitive and fast-paced nature of talent acquisition in the AI industry, where strategic shifts and agility often redefine leaders’ careers.Despite the backlash, Mohan’s contributions to AI-powered developer tools remain significant. He is widely regarded as a pioneer in agentic IDEs, which are tools that integrate AI into the entire coding process, and an influential figure in Silicon Valley’s AI evolution. Now at Google DeepMind, he continues to shape the future of AI-driven software development, although under the shadow of one of the year’s most controversial exits. Some say time will smooth over the headlines, especially if his next innovations speak louder than the noise. In tech, it’s never long before the next big move resets the narrative.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Dhillon, who fled the scene, claimed he was unaware of the victim's identity until news reports surfaced.  JALANDHAR: The driver who fatally struck iconic marathoner Fauja Singh on Jalandhar-Pathankot national highway Monday turned out to be a Canada-returned man who sped away after leaving the 114-year-old to die, Punjab police said on Wednesday.The suspect, Amritpal Singh Dhillon (26), was arrested from his home in Dasupur village, 20km from Jalandhar, on Tuesday. The vehicle, a borrowed white Fortuner bearing a Punjab registration number, was seized. According to Jalandhar Rural SSP H S Virk, Dhillon said he did not know it was Singh he had struck, and that he had fled the scene because he was scared.Police have charged him with culpable homicide and rash driving. The police FIR says the vehicle was speeding, and that Singh's life could have been saved had the driver taken him to hospital rather than fleeing.Singh's son, Harbinder, said the driver should have stopped to help his injured father. "We would not have pursued a complaint against him had my father survived. But he should have stopped," he said. Dhillon told police that Singh was crossing the highway and he could not stop in time as the vehicle was going fast, said Virk. tnn'Realised what I had done when I found TV channels reporting Fauja Singh's death' Dhillon was returning home from Bhogpur, a 16km drive that passed via Beas Pind village. As reported by TOI on Wednesday, the marathoner was walking towards his family dhaba across the road when he was struck.During questioning, Dhillon revealed that it was only at night, when TV channels started reporting Fauja Singh's death, that he realised who he had hit and run, said the SSP.According to police officers, Dhillon claimed he felt very guilty after that. However, he did not come forward to take responsibility for the death that was mourned by the world.It took meticulous detective work to track down the vehicle and the driver.At a press conference on Wednesday, SSP Virk said an eyewitness told police that the vehicle that hit Fauja Singh could have been an Innova or a Fortuner. "We recovered a damaged part of a headlight and when we checked with Toyota agencies, we were told that it could be an old Fortuner from the 2009, 2010, or 2011 models. Then, from CCTV footage, we zeroed in on a Fortuner and also found a damaged headlight from one particular CCTV. We found the registration number from CCTV footage. Investigations revealed that the vehicle had been sold a couple of times," he said. By Tuesday, police felt sure they had the right suspect. And the same night a police team arrived at Dhillon's doorstep.The SSP said Dhillon had gone to Canada on a tourist visa eight years ago and stayed back on getting a work permit. His sisters live there, too. He was in the construction business and has a work visa until 2027. He had come to India on June 23 on an emergency certificate as he had lost his passport. Three weeks into his homecoming, he is now behind bars, accused of killing a legend who seemed to outpace time. Dhillon was produced in a local court on Wednesday and remanded in jail.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousTop 7 compatibility tests for couples on US road tripsLifestyleTop 10 unique love languages of the US couplesLifestyleAvneet Kaur’s Gen-Z street glam is a whole moodtvYamini Singh radiates charm in vibrant traditional wearEntertainmentMulti-layered to florals: Trending diamond-studded payal designsLifestyleBaby boy names that mean warrior!Lifestyle8 books that teach life lessons you’ll never forgetLifestyleNisarga Gowda’s top 10 saree lookstv8 plants that invite pollinators to your balcony gardenLifestyleAdorable bridal looks of Tamil TV actressestv Next123 Photostories  Sai Pallavi to Anushka Shetty: 5 old-school blouse designs inspired by South Indian actresses7 ways to keep Cancer away (from a researcher who has studied the condition for 30 years)Unforgettable relationships that shaped the soul of hindi cinemaWhat happens when you consume Desi Dates (Khajoor) during monsoon and the right way to consume themBigg Boss Malayalam contestants who missed the winner’s trophy but won millions of heartsThe Sky’s the Limit: Know all about the 5 Longest Flights in the WorldTired, bloated, or overheated?

(Photo: DailyEcho/Padharo) Ankit Vaghela, an Indian-origin restaurant owner in Southampton, was told by the police that they could not come to his 'Padharo' when he called 999 to report a break-in. The vandals broke in and fled with several bottles of expensive alcohol and cash but the police helpline asked them to email the CCTV footage of the three burglars who broke in last week.Vaghela decided to get proactive and review the footage first. He discovered his cash register without the cash, abandoned along with some smashed liquor bottles strewn on a nearby road. “It was very heartbreaking to be told that officers will be able to review the damage in three to five working days and that no forensics was available at the time,” said Vaghela.“There was glass everywhere. As a business, we can’t afford to remain closed and had to get things cleaned up and the glass fixed. We are still struggling to operate smoothly without a proper cash register, which will take time, but are determined to welcome our guests with the same level of service we are known for in the city,” he said.The Hampshire Police said they did not underestimate the July 31 case but they understood that their investigation could start without their immediate attendance at the site, as the offenders were not there. “Every deployment decision is based on informed risk assessments to make sure the most serious cases are prioritised, and officers are on scene where there is an immediate threat to life or a crime in action,” the police force said in a statement.“On this occasion, based on the initial information we were given regarding the offenders no longer being at the scene, our investigation could get underway without any immediate attendance. That investigation is progressing with lines of enquiry identified, such as CCTV, and we are in touch with the victim to provide them updates on our investigation,” added the statement, along with an appeal to the public for any information related to the burglary."It means nothing now, the damage is done. Officers were not willing to visit the restaurant," Vaghela told to local news outlets.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

In a separate incident, Laxman Das, an Indian sous chef in Dublin, was attacked and robbed while going to work. These incidents follow a series of recent assaults targeting Indians in Ireland, raising concerns about racism.  TOI correspondent from London: A six-year-old Indian-origin girl and an Indian sous chef are the latest victims in the ongoing spate of racist attacks targeting Indian nationals and Indian-origin Irish people in Ireland.The girl, whose family hail from Kottayam, Kerala, was playing outside her house in Waterford City, southeast Ireland, with friends at 7.30pm on Monday evening when a gang of boys and one girl called her a “dirty Indian” and told her to “go back to India”. She was born in Ireland. Five of the gang also punched her in the face, hit her private parts with a bicycle, punched her neck and twisted her hair.Her mother moved to Ireland eight years ago from Kottayam to work as a nurse with her husband and recently became an Irish citizen.The mother said the gang was made up of boys aged 12 to 14 and a girl aged eight. She said her daughter came home in floods of tears and is now too scared to play outside. She told the Irish Mirror: “I never expected that such an incident would happen. I thought she would be safe here. Even in front of our own house she can’t play safely. I am a nurse, I am doing my best to take care of people. I do my work and I am 100% professional. I changed my citizenship, but still we are called dirty people and even my kids are not safe. We came here to fill a labour gap. We are professionals — we have all the certificates…”The mother studied BSc Nursing at University of Calicut and went to Mount Carmel Higher Secondary School in Kottayam.“Gardaí (Irish national police) responded to a report of an alleged assault in the Kilbarry area of Waterford city on the evening of Monday 4 August. Investigations are ongoing,” a Garda spokesperson told TOI.On Wednesday morning Laxman Das from Kolkata, who works as a sous chef at the Anantara The Marker Dublin hotel, was assaulted near the Hilton Hotel by three people while on his way to work. He was taken to St Vincent's University Hospital.

The arrest occurred due to possession of a fake resident card. Authorities took him into custody in Niagara Falls, New York. He faces a potential 10-year prison sentence. The arrest is part of 'Operation Take Back America'. This initiative targets illegal immigration.  An Indian national has been arrested in the United States for allegedly possessing a forged alien resident card, according to the Justice Department. Swapnil Ramesh Tejale, 34, was taken into custody following a traffic stop in Niagara Falls, New York, and now faces a federal charge that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.“On July 10, 2025, the Niagara Falls Border Patrol Station received a request from the Niagara Falls Police Department to help identify three individuals that they had encountered during a traffic stop,” said Assistant US Attorney Michael J. Smith, who is prosecuting the case. “Agents arrived at the scene and questioned the three individuals as to their citizenship. Tejale presented a Lawful Permanent Resident Card but voluntarily admitted that the card was fictitious.”Authorities later confirmed that Tejale was in the country unlawfully and did not possess any valid immigration documents. Following his arrest, agents discovered a Social Security card in his name, which was also found to be counterfeit.The case falls under “Operation Take Back America”, a Justice Department initiative aimed at tackling illegal immigration and dismantling transnational criminal organisations. The operation seeks to “repel the invasion of illegal immigration” and “protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime”, the department said.The investigation was led by the US Border Patrol Niagara Falls Station, under the direction of Patrol Agent in Charge Brady Waikal.Tejale’s arrest is part of a series of immigration enforcement actions involving Indian nationals this year. In a related incident, an Indian man from Santa Rosa, California, was sentenced in March to six months in prison for conspiracy to transport aliens for profit. Meanwhile, Manjot Singh, a 25-year-old Indian national, was recently arrested in the Seattle area for repeat offences including robbery, assault, and criminal impersonation. Singh, who entered the U.S. illegally, is currently in ICE custody pending deportation.ICE officials have said that Singh’s arrest is a warning to repeat offenders: “Those who violate US laws while in the country illegally face arrest and deportation.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Viral footage shows firefighters inspecting the scene as the family performed the ritual. (Photo: X) A housewarming ceremony involving a Hindu havan at a Texas home took an unexpected turn when local firefighters arrived at the scene, mistaking the ritual for a fire emergency.The incident was captured on video. The footage has gone viral and has fuelled an online debate over cultural awareness and fire safety. The clip was originally shared on Instagram. It shows a fire truck from the Bedford fire department pulling up outside the house as smoke from the ceremony fills the garage. Inside, an Indian family can be seen performing a traditional havan, a religious ritual involving fire, as part of their housewarming puja.The video includes on-screen text stating, "Cultural misunderstanding 101: A Hindu puja is not a fire emergency. When you're having a housewarming havan and the fire department pulls up."Shortly after the fire crew arrives, they are seen speaking with members of the family and inspecting the area. However, it remains unclear whether any formal action was taken or if any fire codes were violated during the ritual.The footage has since been widely circulated across social media platforms, with users offering differing views on the incident. Some social media users criticised the family for conducting a ritual involving fire in a residential setting, arguing it could pose safety risks. Others defended the family’s right to observe their religious customs, calling the incident a clear example of cultural misunderstanding.No official comment was immeditaely released by the Bedford fire department.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Indian-origin Mathura Sridharan was appointed as Ohio's 12th solicitor general, inviting the wrath of online trolls who questioned why a 'non-US-origin' person was not picked for the post. Sridharan's LinkedIn went viral as critics questioned her credibility -- forcing Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost to issue a clarification, or a clapback at the trolls. Dave Yost, who announced Mathura's promotion, said Mathura is wrongly being portrayed as a non-American. "A few commenters have asserted incorrectly that Mathura is not American. She is a United States citizen, married to a US citizen, and the child of naturalized US citizens," he said. "If her name or her complexion bother you, the problem is not with her or her appointment," he added."Mathura is brilliant… she won her argument at SCOTUS last year. Both the SGs she worked under (Flowers & Gaiser) recommended her. I told her when I originally hired her I needed her to argue with me. She does… All the time! Excited to promote her. She will serve Ohio well," Yost wrote.Yost's clapback also met trolling as people commented that she is not "American-American". "Is she a Christian? That’s the biggest factor that concerns me. Based on the bindi on her forehead, I worry she is not," one wrote. "Another American job… given away to foreigners," another wrote. "She's Indian. They all have a loyalty first to other Indians. horrible pick. Totally un-American. the GOP is pathetic," a third user wrote."No one with the last name 'Sridharan' fought in the US Civil War. She's not an American," another wrote.Before joining the Ohio Solicitor’s Office, Mathura clerked for Judge Steven J. Menashi of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and Judge Deborah A. Batts of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. She holds a Juris Doctor from New York University School of Law, a Master’s Degree in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as a Bachelor’s Degree in Economics and in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

We welcome your feedback on articles but there has to be some parameters, and these are explained in our community house rules...We cannot tolerate hate. We cannot tolerate abuse towards individuals in our stories or other commenters," the company's social media policy says. Radio New Zealand had to do the same on the social media post on Ravishankar's appointment. "Under RNZ's comments policy, we will proactively disable comments on posts which may attract abusive or harmful comments or when resources are required elsewhere," a spokesperson for RNZ said. "In this instance, the comments were disabled after our monitoring found racist comments," the spokesperson said. "We want people to feel safe and respected on our community forums and will continue to proactively disable comments where necessary. We will not tolerate harmful communications."1News said it received a large number of comments on the post that announced Ravishankar's appointment and a vast majority were inappropriate.

After her TikTok video went viral, another ICE official offered help. Chatterjee highlights the broader issue of poor ICE communication, impacting immigrants facing detention and difficult bond policies, leading some to abandon their asylum claims. Trisha Chatterjee (Picture source: LinkedIn) Trisha Chatterjee, an Indian-origin immigration lawyer in Ohio, has alleged she was given the number of a Taco Bell outlet when she called ICE for urgent client support. Chatterjee posted about the incident on TikTok, where it went viral and ultimately led to help from another ICE official. But she says the larger issue lack of clear access to immigration authorities continues to cause serious harm to her clients."I called and they answered and they said, 'Hello, Taco Bell?' And I said, 'Taco Bell?' And the guy who was working said, 'Yeah, Taco Bell. Ma'am, you called me," Chatterjee recalled."I was in such disbelief," she said. "So, I called the ICE officer back, just really frustrated with what had just happened. He says, 'Oh, I'm sorry. I was trying to lighten the mood and make you laugh.'"ICE has denied the accusation. Homeland security called it a “lie and a smear.” Chatterjee stood by her version of events.Who is Trisha Chatterjee? Trisha Chatterjee is an Indian-origin immigration lawyer based in Greater Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio. She graduated from Miami University in 2020 and the University of Dayton School of Law in 2023.She works with the law office of Emily Feliz Garcia, a small immigration firm in Springdale. Before this, she worked at Abdallah law offices.For the last two years, she has handled immigration cases, especially those involving clients detained at the Butler County Jail in Ohio, which has a contract with ICE.Chatterjee was trying to submit "stay of removal" applications—urgent paperwork that can pause deportation for clients with pending immigration cases. ICE requires these to be submitted in person at the Detroit field office, but she hoped to file them locally in Blue Ash.After being unable to reach anyone by phone or email, she finally spoke to an ICE officer who gave her a phone number that turned out to be for Taco Bell. When she called back, the officer reportedly said he was trying to make her laugh.She posted a video about the incident on TikTok, which gained over 38,000 views. Many users sympathised, and one even helped her connect with a helpful ICE official in Blue Ash, who is now assisting her.Chatterjee said the larger problem is the lack of access and communication with ICE. She also highlighted how a stricter bond policy is making it harder for immigrants to stay out of detention during legal proceedings. Bonds can cost up to $50,000 and must be paid upfront.According to Chatterjee, some clients are abandoning their asylum cases or choosing to self-deport out of fear. She mentioned recent local arrests of people attending ICE check-ins, which has only deepened anxiety in immigrant communities.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Bhagwagar is expected to be arraigned Wednesday in Martinez, California.“Our office stands firmly committed to protecting children and holding those who cause harm accountable,” said Contra Costa county district attorney Diana Becton in a statement. “Every child deserves to feel safe, protected and heard when an injustice like this occurs.”According to the Contra Costa county sheriff’s office, detectives had been investigating Bhagwagar since April. His arrest was made with the assistance of Homeland Security Investigations after a warrant was issued.A short video published by aviation blog View From the Wing shows officers with badges exiting the plane’s cockpit.Delta Air Lines released a statement saying it was “appalled by reports of the charges related to the arrest” and confirmed that Bhagwagar had been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation. “Delta has zero tolerance for unlawful conduct,” the airline said.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani faces criticism for visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam due to his past support for defunding the police. Critics accuse Mamdani of shifting his stance for political gain, especially after his 2020 tweets resurfaced. Mamdani defends his actions, clarifying his current position on public safety and police funding. Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is facing backlash after visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam, as critics pointed to his past 2020 tweet supporting "defund the police" stance.The controversy erupted after Mamdani, who recently returned from a trip to Uganda, visited the grieving family of officer Islam, one of four victims killed in a mass shooting in Midtown Manhattan. Zohran Mamdani’s SECRET Wedding Triggers Fury Amid Local Tragedy | WATCHThe shooter, Shane Tamura, opened fire on Monday, killing Islam and three others before shooting himself.Sharing a post on X, Mamdani wrote: “Two days ago, an act of senseless violence took the lives of Officer Didarul Islam, Wesley LePatner, Aland Etienne, and Julia Hyman. Today, I visited Officer Islam's family and learned of his legacy. I ask you to join me in honoring the memory of these four New Yorkers.”However, the post quickly drew criticism, with users referencing Mamdani’s previous tweets during the height of the “Defund the Police” movement in 2020.Many accused him of changing his stance for political gain. One user wrote, “You can't go from defund the police to never mind I love the police. You're asking New Yorkers to forgo their guns meanwhile you just had a wedding in Uganda with armed guards.”While another posted, “Zohran Mamdani exposed as a total fraud. Mocking cops, calling them racist, then acting like he cares? No loyalty to America. He belongs in Uganda, not leading NYC. Deport him and protect our city!”Earlier at a press conference following his visit to the officer’s home in The Bronx, Mamdani addressed the criticism and attempted to clarify his position saying: “I am not defunding the police; I am not running to defund the police.”“Over the course of this race, I’ve been very clear about my view of public safety and the critical role that the police have in creating that public safety,” he added.Standing alongside members of the Bangladeshi American Police Association—of which Officer Islam was a member—and labor union 32BJ, which represented another victim, Aland Etienne, Mamdani tried to strike a unifying tone.During the peak of the "Defund the Police" movement in 2020, Zohran Mamdani repeatedly called for major cuts to the NYPD budget. In one post, he wrote, “We don’t need an investigation to know that the NYPD is racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety. What we need is to #DefundTheNYPD.”In another, he said, “There is no negotiating with an institution this wicked & corrupt. Defund it. Dismantle it. End the cycle of violence,” referencing budget talks around proposed NYPD cuts.Now, Mamdani has distanced himself from those remarks. When asked about them, he responded, “My statements in 2020 were made amidst a frustration that many New Yorkers held at the murder of George Floyd.”Mamdani claimed that his current stance is more nuanced, stating that his previous posts were “clearly out of step” with his recent campaign platform. He now supports maintaining the NYPD headcount while reducing its overtime budget.Despite this clarification, skepticism remains. Many police officers and political observers have accused Mamdani of shifting positions purely for political gain in a city where public safety remains a top concern for voters, New York Post reported.Adding to the political firestorm, former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams, who are both trailing Mamdani in early polling for the 2025 mayoral race, weighed in shortly after the shooting. Mamdani fired back, accusing Cuomo of politicising the tragedy saying, “It is beyond me that politicians are looking to use these days to score such cynical political points, on the very day that I held the father of Officer Islam in my arms and he could not utter a single word.”“For the former governor to spend an entire day speaking almost exclusively about me and barely about the New Yorkers who have been killed is indicative of the very politics New Yorkers want to leave in the past,” he added.All three, Mamdani, Cuomo, and Adams are expected to attend officer Islam’s funeral on Thursday.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The high court found him guilty of rape and outrage of modesty, following incidents at his Jurong West shop in 2021. Despite his denials and claims of erectile dysfunction, the judge deemed the victim's testimony credible.  An Indian national was sentenced to more than 14 years in jail on Thursday by the Singapore high court for sexually assaulting a minor, reports the Straits Times.Ramalingam Selvasekaran was handed a sentence of 14 years, three months and two weeks after being found guilty of rape and two counts of outrage of modesty after assaulting an 11-year-old at his provision shop in Jurong West.According to the court, the assaults occurred between 4.50 pm and 5.05 pm on October 28, 2021. The girl had visited Ramalingam’s store and returned later to buy ice cream. Prosecutors said he led her into a back area and forced her to perform oral sex. After the incident, the girl sought help from a passerby, who called the police.Ramalingam represented himself during the trial, which began on January 16. He was convicted on all charges on 7 July.“The fact that she had not run off after the first act of molest, or that she did not resist the assaults, or inform her grandfather, were all to my mind sufficiently explained, particularly given that she was still young and immature,” said Justice Aidan Xu, who found the girl’s account credible and consistent.Ramalingam’s earlier statements to police reportedly included admissions of hugging, kissing, and oral sex. However, he later denied any wrongdoing, claiming he was suffering from erectile dysfunction and that no DNA evidence was found on the victim.The judge ruled that these claims did not undermine the girl’s testimony. “While there was no dispute that Ramalingam suffered from erectile dysfunction, the prosecution’s expert witness gave a cogent explanation that oral rape remained possible,” Justice Xu was quoted as saying to Straits Times.Following sentencing on July 30, Ramalingam said he would appeal and was granted bail of S$80,000. He attempted to negotiate with the judge over the conditions, asking for the removal of his electronic tag and exemption from reporting to the Police Cantonment Complex. Both requests were denied.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The incidents, condemned by authorities and community leaders, are being treated as linked. This follows a separate racist assault in Adelaide, where an Indian man was brutally attacked after being told to "f--- off, Indian."  A Hindu temple in Melbourne’s eastern suburb of Boronia was defaced with racist graffiti this week prompting widespread condemnation and police investigation.As reported by The Brisbane Times and The Sydney Morning Herald, offensive red graffiti with the words “Go home” and other racial slurs were found daubed across the Shree Swaminarayan Temple on Wadhurst Drive, as well as two nearby Asian-operated restaurants Kingsland Chinese Restaurant and Charles King Dumpling.Police said a healing centre on Mountain Highway was also defaced the same night, bringing the total number of sites attacked to four. “There is absolutely no place at all in our society for hate-based and racist behaviour,” Victoria Police said in a statement. Authorities confirmed that all four incidents are being treated as linked and that an investigation is under way.PollShould harsher penalties be implemented for hate crimes?Yes, definitelyNo, current laws are sufficient'An attack on our right to worship'Makrand Bhagwat, President of the Hindu Council of Australia’s Victoria chapter, told Australia Today the vandalism of the temple was “heartbreaking” for the community. “Our temple is meant to be a sanctuary of peace, devotion and unity,” he said. “To have it targeted in this way feels like an attack on our identity, our right to worship and freedom of religion.”Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan sent a personal message of support to temple management. “What happened this week was hateful, racist and deeply disturbing,” she wrote. “It wasn’t just vandalism – it was a deliberate act of hate, designed to intimidate, isolate, and spread fear.”Local interfaith networks, including the City of Greater Knox’s Multifaith Network, have expressed support. “We want to show that love and solidarity triumph over hate,” said community leader Vikrant Thakur.Indian man targeted in racist attackThis came after a 23-year-old Indian man, Charanpreet Singh, was brutally attacked and left unconscious on a street in Adelaide following a reported racist assault linked to a parking dispute. According to 9News, the men allegedly told Singh to "f--- off, Indian" before launching a violent, unprovoked assault.“They just said ‘f--- off, Indian’, and after that they just started punching,” Singh said. “I tried to fight back, but they beat me until I was unconscious.”He sustained serious injuries, including brain trauma and facial fractures. A 20-year-old from Enfield was arrested and charged, but others involved remain at large.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Singh and his wife were allegedly ambushed by a group of men who shouted racial slurs before inflicting serious injuries. The incident has sparked outrage and renewed calls for enhanced safety measures for international students in the area.  An Indian international student has been hospitalised with serious injuries after a violent assault in Australia's Adelaide that is being investigated as a possible racially motivated attack. The incident has sparked outrage across the Indian community and renewed calls for better safety measures for international students.Charanpreet Singh, 23, was with his wife near Kintore Avenue on Saturday evening (July 19) when they were allegedly ambushed by a group of five men. According to Australia Today, the couple had just parked their car to view the city’s light displays around 9:22pm when the attackers emerged from another vehicle.Viral video shows assaultEyewitnesses and video footage shared on social media reportedly show the men striking Singh with what appeared to be metal knuckles or sharp objects, while shouting racial abuse including: “F--- off, Indian”. The attackers then fled the scene, leaving Singh unconscious and seriously injured on the road.PollWhat should be prioritized to improve safety for international students?Awareness campaigns and community supportStronger law enforcement and quicker actionSingh, who spoke to 9News from his hospital bed, said the altercation began over a car parking dispute but escalated into a racially charged assault. “They just said, ‘F--- off, Indian,’ and after that they just started punching,” he recalled. “You can change anything in your body, but you can’t change the colours.”He sustained facial fractures and brain trauma, and was taken by emergency services to the Royal Adelaide Hospital for overnight treatment. The assault has left members of the local Indian community shaken, with many expressing solidarity with Singh online.“When things like this happen, it makes you feel like you should go back,” Singh said.Police investigation under waySouth Australia Police confirmed they were called to Kintore Avenue shortly before 9.30pm and found Singh with facial injuries. “He was taken to hospital for treatment. Investigations are continuing,” a police spokesperson told The Indian Sun. One man, a 20-year-old from Enfield, has been arrested and charged with assault causing harm. The other suspects remain at large.Authorities are reviewing CCTV footage from the area and have urged witnesses to come forward. “We ask anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers,” the police said.Premier Peter Malinauskas has condemned the incident, calling it “completely unwelcome in our state”. He added, “Any time we see any evidence of any racial attack, it is just not consistent with where the majority of our community are at.”Another attack in DublinThis follows another attack targeting an Indian individual. An Indian man in his 40s was hospitalised after being brutally attacked by a group of teenage boys in a violent, racist assault in Dublin on Saturday evening. The gang falsely accused him of inappropriate behaviour with children before beating him and pulling down his trousers. “Gardaí in Tallaght were alerted to an incident at Parkhill Road... Investigations are ongoing,” police said. Councillor Baby Pereppadan said, “He couldn’t speak much because of the shock.” Sinn Féin’s Seán Crowe added, “You are sowing hate, fear, and division.” A protest is planned for July 26 to condemn rising racist violence in Ireland.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Her exit, surprising to many, opens an opportunity for the U.S. Treasury to propose a successor amidst global trade dynamic shifts. Gopinath, the first female chief economist, joined the IMF in 2019 and was promoted in 2022. Gita Gopinath (File photo) NEW DELHI: Gita Gopinath, the second-in-command at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), will step down at the end of August to return to her position at Harvard University, the IMF announced on Monday.The timing of Gita Gopinath’s exit has taken many within the IMF by surprise and is believed to have been prompted by her own decision, reported news agency Reuters. Having originally left Harvard to serve at the Fund, she is now set to resume her role as professor of economics at the university. Her departure opens a window for the US Treasury to propose a successor—an opportunity that comes as President Donald Trump pushes to reshape global trade dynamics and curb the country’s persistent trade deficits through sweeping tariffs on imports worldwide. Gopinath, who joined the IMF in 2019 as its first-ever female chief economist, was elevated to First Deputy Managing Director in January 2022. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva will appoint her successor “in due course,” the statement added.Gopinath had served as the first female chief economist of the Washington-based global lender for three years. Gopinath's research has been published in many top economics journals. Prior to her appointment as IMF Chief Economist, she was the John Zwaanstra Professor of International Studies and Economics in the economics department of Harvard University. Before joining the faculty of Harvard University in 2005, she was an assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.Gopinath, who considers herself a product of the Indian education system, she completed her schooling in Mysuru. She had her first brush with macro-economic challenges while doing her bachelor’s degree at Lady Shri Ram College, Delhi, with India experiencing its first major external financing and currency crisis in 1990-91. “This inspired me to pursue graduate work in economics and was the foundation for my interest in international finance,” she had told in an interview in 2010.Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.AI Masterclass for Students.

The case relates to the death of Piang Ngaih Don, a domestic worker from Myanmar, who died on July 26, 2016, from brain injuries caused by repeated blunt trauma. At the time of her death, she was severely malnourished, weighing just 24 kilograms.'Nothing Comes Free, Won't Stop...': Singapore PM's Big Announcement At Military EventAccording to Channel News Asia, Chelvam, who was Don’s legal employer, allowed her to be abused over several months by his ex-wife, Gaiyathiri Murugayan, and his mother-in-law, Prema S Narayanasamy. Murugayan and Narayanasamy are already serving 30-year and 17-year sentences, respectively, for their roles in the abuse.PollShould there be stricter laws against domestic abuse?Yes, absolutelyNo, current laws are enoughDistrict Judge Teoh Ai Lin noted Chelvam’s failure to intervene or protect Don, despite witnessing her deteriorating condition. He also removed the home’s CCTV recorder to conceal evidence and lied to investigators.Prosecutor Sean Teh said video footage showed Chelvam present during several episodes of abuse and accused him of supporting the starvation that contributed to Don’s death.Chelvam was acquitted on a fifth charge of using criminal force.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The suspects were arrested in connection with a kidnapping and torture case. The case involved an international Punjabi street gang. The gang is accused of running a brutal extortion racket. The racket stretches from California to murder plots in India. Authorities in California and the FBI are investigating eight Indian-origin suspects arrested in San Joaquin County for allegedly kidnapping and torturing a man as part of an international extortion scheme. The gang, led by Pavittar Singh, wanted in India for multiple murders, targeted Indian-Americans. JALANDHAR: Investigating the eight Indian-origin suspects arrested in San Joaquin County, California, on July 11, county authorities and FBI said the international Punjabi street gang kidnapped a local man, stripped him naked, and tortured him for hours as part of a brutal extortion racket that stretches from California'to murder plots in India.The authorities have urged Indian-Americas to report such extortion threats.Addressing a joint press conference, they revealed the gang leader, Pavittar Singh, was also wanted in India for multiple murders and firearms offences, including a killing in Batala, Punjab.Indian Student Handcuffed at Newark Airport in US to Be Deported; India Protests, Seeks ExplanationPollDo you think the involvement of international authorities is necessary in this case?Yes, it’s crucialNo, local authorities can handle itFBI also cited earlier US arrests of Indian gang leaders: Gurdev 'Jassal' Singh (RPG attacks), Harpreet Singh, also known as Happy Passia, Lawrence Bishnoi's brother Anmol , linked to the murder of singer Sidhu Moose Wala, and others.8 Indian-origin suspects face life in jail without bailEight suspects, led by Pavittar, now face charges of kidnapping for ransom, torture and illegal weapons that carry life sentences. A multi-agency SWAT sweep on July 11 had netted machine guns, an assault rifle, and $15,000 cash stashed in a ceiling vent.Sheriff Patrick Withrow said they were tipped off on June 21 about a horrendous crime that occurred on June 19 in the Manteca area. They contacted the victim and, on July 11, their AGNET Unit — alongside SWAT teams from FBI, Stockton police, Manteca police and Stanislaus County sheriff's office — executed five coordinated search warrants across the county and arrested the suspects. Withrow said the purpose of the torture was to extract names of other potential extortion targets in the Indian-American business community. Elaborating on the federal and international angle, Sid Patel from FBISacramento field office said Pavittar was wanted in India for firearm violations, assault and multiple murders abroad. He revealed six of the eight suspects were picked up by ICE ERO for immigration proceedings, and FBI was coordinating with India and Canada on extradition after US sentences.San Joaquin County District Attorney Ron Freitas told the press conference that they filed two complaints charging the eight men with serious gang-related crimes, including kidnapping, torture, extortion, witness intimidation, and multiple weapon violations. They said the suspects faced life in prison, with no bail and no exceptions.Apart from Pavitar, other members of the gang included Dilpreet Singh, Sarbjit Singh, Gurtaj Singh, Amritpall Singh, Vishal Singh, Arshpreet Singh, and Manpreet Randhawa. According to the sheriff and FBI, the gang operations included extortion of Indian-American business owners, forced free labour, violent truck cargo hijackings along Central Valley, weapons and drug trafficking, and international political violence (RPG attacks, assassinations, grenade assaults on police stations in India).Each of the accused faces a life-in-prison baseline for kidnapping for ransom, along with firearm and gang enhancements that could push to life without parole. The sheriff even said, "Suspects are animals with little or no regard for human life."Announcing the setting up of an anonymous tip line specifically for this case, the sheriff urged Indian-American residents to report extortion and intimidation attempts. "Help us hunt the rest of this gang — call us."About the AuthorIP SinghIP Singh is Senior Assistant Editor at The Times of India.

This happened after a $3 billion OpenAI acquisition fell through. The move upset investors and the public. Windsurf was later saved by Cognition. Mohan's actions sparked debate about loyalty. Despite the controversy, his contributions to AI are significant. He now works at Google DeepMind, shaping AI development.  Varun Mohan, a rising star in Silicon Valley and co-founder of AI startup Windsurf, is under fire after abruptly quitting to join Google’s DeepMind, effectively tanking a $3 billion acquisition deal with OpenAI. His sudden decision stunned colleagues and disrupted months of negotiations, raising questions about loyalty, corporate ethics, and the volatile nature of tech leadership. The move triggered widespread criticism from investors, industry peers, and the public, with some branding Mohan a “generational villain” for leaving his team behind during a crucial transition. While Windsurf was later rescued in a last-minute deal by Cognition, the controversy has cast a long shadow over Mohan’s once-admired career. But who is the man at the center of this high-stakes tech saga?Varun Mohan: Windsurf Co-founder with Indian rootsVarun Mohan was born and raised in Sunnyvale, California, to Indian immigrant parents. While the specific region in India remains undisclosed, his upbringing was defined by a blend of Indian cultural values and the American spirit of innovation. Encouraged to excel academically, Mohan showed an early aptitude for mathematics and computer science, regularly winning accolades in national Olympiads and competitions.Google Pixel 10 Series Launch: Everything Coming on August 20Mohan’s academic journey led him to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he pursued a rare dual-degree program. He completed a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). He specialized in areas like operating systems, machine learning, distributed computing, and algorithms, laying the groundwork for his future in AI infrastructure and developer tools.During his time at MIT, Mohan built his technical foundation with internships at major tech firms and research institutions, including Quora, LinkedIn, Samsung, Cloudera, and UC Santa Cruz. After graduating, he joined the self-driving startup Nuro, where he quickly rose to the role of Lead Software Engineer. These experiences gave him hands-on exposure to complex AI systems and real-world applications of machine learning.Co-founding Windsurf: Building an AI-native IDEIn 2021, Mohan co-founded Codeium, which was later rebranded as Windsurf, along with MIT classmate Douglas Chen. The company initially focused on GPU virtualization for deep learning but later pivoted to create Cascade, an AI-powered integrated development environment (IDE). The tool allowed developers to write, test, and refactor code with AI support, onboarding over a million users within just four months. Windsurf raised $243 million in funding and reached a $1.25 billion valuation, becoming one of the fastest-growing AI unicorns in the United States.Fallout from the Google moveIn 2025, OpenAI was reportedly in advanced talks to acquire Windsurf for $3 billion. But just as the deal neared completion, Mohan and Chen resigned and licensed Windsurf’s technology to Google in a $2.4 billion agreement. Mohan then joined Google DeepMind, taking key team members with him. The sudden departure left Windsurf in crisis and eventually prompted a weekend-long rescue operation by AI firm Cognition. The move sparked outrage across the tech world. Meanwhile, Twitter memes and LinkedIn rants turned Mohan into Silicon Valley’s most talked-about defector. Whether he’s a visionary or a villain, Varun Mohan has undeniably made his mark.Backlash from investors and the publicThe fallout was swift and public. Venture capitalist Vinod Khosla criticized Mohan for abandoning his team, while Cognition CEO Scott Wu called the exit a betrayal of founder responsibility. On social media, users accused Mohan of prioritizing personal gain over team loyalty. One post read, “Founders cashing out while the team’s left behind isn’t just bad form. It’s long-term reputation damage.” Another user bluntly called him a “generational villain.” Some industry experts suggest Mohan's move reflects the fiercely competitive and fast-paced nature of talent acquisition in the AI industry, where strategic shifts and agility often redefine leaders’ careers.Despite the backlash, Mohan’s contributions to AI-powered developer tools remain significant. He is widely regarded as a pioneer in agentic IDEs, which are tools that integrate AI into the entire coding process, and an influential figure in Silicon Valley’s AI evolution. Now at Google DeepMind, he continues to shape the future of AI-driven software development, although under the shadow of one of the year’s most controversial exits. Some say time will smooth over the headlines, especially if his next innovations speak louder than the noise.

Amritpal Singh Dhillon, a Canada-returned man, was arrested for fatally hitting 114-year-old marathoner Fauja Singh with a borrowed Fortuner on the Jalandhar-Pathankot highway. Dhillon, who fled the scene, claimed he was unaware of the victim's identity until news reports surfaced.  JALANDHAR: The driver who fatally struck iconic marathoner Fauja Singh on Jalandhar-Pathankot national highway Monday turned out to be a Canada-returned man who sped away after leaving the 114-year-old to die, Punjab police said on Wednesday.The suspect, Amritpal Singh Dhillon (26), was arrested from his home in Dasupur village, 20km from Jalandhar, on Tuesday. The vehicle, a borrowed white Fortuner bearing a Punjab registration number, was seized. According to Jalandhar Rural SSP H S Virk, Dhillon said he did not know it was Singh he had struck, and that he had fled the scene because he was scared.Police have charged him with culpable homicide and rash driving. The police FIR says the vehicle was speeding, and that Singh's life could have been saved had the driver taken him to hospital rather than fleeing.Singh's son, Harbinder, said the driver should have stopped to help his injured father. "We would not have pursued a complaint against him had my father survived. But he should have stopped," he said. Dhillon told police that Singh was crossing the highway and he could not stop in time as the vehicle was going fast, said Virk. tnn'Realised what I had done when I found TV channels reporting Fauja Singh's death' Dhillon was returning home from Bhogpur, a 16km drive that passed via Beas Pind village. As reported by TOI on Wednesday, the marathoner was walking towards his family dhaba across the road when he was struck.During questioning, Dhillon revealed that it was only at night, when TV channels started reporting Fauja Singh's death, that he realised who he had hit and run, said the SSP.According to police officers, Dhillon claimed he felt very guilty after that. However, he did not come forward to take responsibility for the death that was mourned by the world.It took meticulous detective work to track down the vehicle and the driver.At a press conference on Wednesday, SSP Virk said an eyewitness told police that the vehicle that hit Fauja Singh could have been an Innova or a Fortuner. "We recovered a damaged part of a headlight and when we checked with Toyota agencies, we were told that it could be an old Fortuner from the 2009, 2010, or 2011 models. Then, from CCTV footage, we zeroed in on a Fortuner and also found a damaged headlight from one particular CCTV. We found the registration number from CCTV footage. Investigations revealed that the vehicle had been sold a couple of times," he said. By Tuesday, police felt sure they had the right suspect. And the same night a police team arrived at Dhillon's doorstep.The SSP said Dhillon had gone to Canada on a tourist visa eight years ago and stayed back on getting a work permit. His sisters live there, too. He was in the construction business and has a work visa until 2027. He had come to India on June 23 on an emergency certificate as he had lost his passport. Three weeks into his homecoming, he is now behind bars, accused of killing a legend who seemed to outpace time. Dhillon was produced in a local court on Wednesday and remanded in jail.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousTop 7 compatibility tests for couples on US road tripsLifestyleTop 10 unique love languages of the US couplesLifestyleAvneet Kaur’s Gen-Z street glam is a whole moodtvYamini Singh radiates charm in vibrant traditional wearEntertainmentMulti-layered to florals: Trending diamond-studded payal designsLifestyleBaby boy names that mean warrior!Lifestyle8 books that teach life lessons you’ll never forgetLifestyleNisarga Gowda’s top 10 saree lookstv8 plants that invite pollinators to your balcony gardenLifestyleAdorable bridal looks of Tamil TV actressestv Next123 Photostories  Sai Pallavi to Anushka Shetty: 5 old-school blouse designs inspired by South Indian actresses7 ways to keep Cancer away (from a researcher who has studied the condition for 30 years)Unforgettable relationships that shaped the soul of hindi cinemaWhat happens when you consume Desi Dates (Khajoor) during monsoon and the right way to consume themBigg Boss Malayalam contestants who missed the winner’s trophy but won millions of heartsThe Sky’s the Limit: Know all about the 5 Longest Flights in the WorldTired, bloated, or overheated?

Harris courts Republicans with events on abortion rights, border security, and small business creation, while Trump takes stances that upset some conservatives. Both aim to expand their coalitions before the election. Kamala Harris trolled for 'fake accent'Kamala Harris trolled for 'fake accent' Kamala Harris trolled for 'fake accent'Kamala Harris trolled for 'fake accent' Kamala Harris trolled for 'fake accent'1234 In a surprising turn of events, US presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are blurring party lines as they vie for votes in the final stretch of a highly competitive election.Harris has been actively courting Republican voters, hosting events focused on issues such as abortion rights, border security, and small business creation, which have featured Republican officials.The Democratic National Convention even granted speaking slots to seven Republicans last month, and outside groups are spending millions to help Harris connect with disaffected opposing party members.Simultaneously, Harris has adopted a more assertive foreign policy stance, pledging to include a Republican in her Cabinet if elected and openly discussing her gun ownership."If somebody breaks in my house they're getting shot. Sorry," Harris told Oprah Winfrey, surprising the television star with her candour. Harris' strong support for US leadership on the global stage has already earned her the backing of more than 100 Republican national security and foreign policy officials who previously served under various presidents, including Dick Cheney.Trump, on the other hand, has taken positions that have irked some conservatives. He recently called for a federal cap on credit card interest rates at 10%. He expressed support for a federal law mandating insurance companies to cover in vitro fertilization (IVF), despite opposition from social conservatives who believe embryos used in the process should be protected.Barbara Comstock, a former Republican congresswoman from Virginia who co-chaired Nikki Haley's GOP presidential campaign, now supports Harris, citing her call for an expanded child care tax credit, support for a tough bipartisan immigration bill, and a foreign policy stance in contrast to Trump's admiration for leaders like Vladimir Putin.Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii and now a top Trump ally, describes Trump's policy approach as "common sense," highlighting his support for criminal justice reform and a foreign policy philosophy that seeks to avoid US involvement in global conflicts like the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Despite the candidates' embrace of policies that appeal to the other side, their priorities still largely align with their party's traditions.Trump opposes abortion rights and plans to vote to uphold a Florida law banning abortions after six weeks, while Harris supports abortion rights as protected under Roe v. Wade, backs a ban on assault weapons, and wants to extend prescription drug cost caps to all Americans.As the election draws near, both candidates are working to expand their coalitions. Trump's spokesman, Brian Hughes, argues that the GOP nominee has appeal among African Americans, Hispanics, and labour union members, citing the Teamsters Union's decision not to endorse either candidate as a significant win for Trump.Meanwhile, Harris, who has only been in the presidential race for eight weeks, is beginning to articulate specific policy plans that favour liberal policies in most cases, such as combating climate change, supporting labour unions, and pushing for voting rights legislation to combat racial discrimination.

The Ambedkar Association of North America is involved in a wide range of social projects in education and healthcare. Governor of Michigan Gretchen Whitmer declared April 14, 2022, as 'Doctor B R Ambedkar Equity Day', and Michigan's senator (state legislature) Dayna Polehanki called Dr Ambekar the Martin Luther King of India.The event also saw NRIs of the Ambedkarite movement joining from Ohio, Indiana and Chicago (Illinois).End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksInfosys OvertimeRailOneHDB Financial ServicesPost Office Saving SchemesAnti Trump ProtestsCrizac IPOGold Price PredictionTop TrendingLebron JamesPatrick MahomesRyan LindgrenJordan SpenceCorey Seager WifeK Andre MillerDiddy Trial VerdictDwyane WadeInd vs Eng Test liveMitch MarnerTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website‘Elon may have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa if…’: Donald Trump’s warning to Tesla chief amid ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ feud'A muffled boom and ...

(AP) WASHINGTON: The United States said Thursday that Russia is on the verge of unleashing a massive military attack against Ukraine, dismissing Moscow's claim to be pulling forces back, as artillery fire hit a Ukrainian kindergarten.In a dramatic, previously unscheduled speech to the United Nations in New York, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said intelligence showed Moscow could order an assault on its neighbor in the "coming days."With US and other Western governments saying they see no evidence of Russia's claim to be withdrawing, Blinken challenged the Kremlin to "announce today with no qualification, equivocation or deflection that Russia will not invade Ukraine.""Demonstrate it by sending your troops, your tanks, your planes, back to their barracks and hangers," he said.Russia denies any invasion plans but warned of "military-technical measures" if its far-reaching demands for a US and NATO pullback from eastern Europe aren't satisfied.The United States said late Thursday that Blinken and his Moscow counterpart Sergei Lavrov had agreed to meet next week -- provided there was no invasion before then.Keeping up the pressure, President Joe Biden accused Moscow of preparing a "false flag operation" as a pretext for an attack."They have not moved any of their troops out. They've moved more troops in," Biden said. "Every indication we have is that they're prepared to go into Ukraine."He added, however, that diplomacy is not dead. "There is a path. There is a way through this," he said.Biden will hold a phone meeting Friday with the leaders of Germany, Britain, France, the European Union and NATO to discuss the Ukraine crisis.Russia has massed enormous air, land and sea forces around Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin and officials say the troops are only conducting practice exercises.However, Putin has made clear that the price for removing any threat would be Ukraine agreeing never to join NATO and for the Western alliance to pull back from a swath of eastern Europe, effectively splitting the continent into Cold War-style spheres of influence.The United States said that it had received Putin's response to its offers of a diplomatic solution to the crisis, but did not give any reaction to the contents.The Russian foreign ministry indicated that there was little to discuss."In the absence of will on the American side to negotiate firm and legally binding guarantees on our security from the United States and its allies, Russia will be forced to respond, including with military-technical measures," the foreign ministry said."We insist on the withdrawal of all US armed forces in Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Baltics."Russia also expelled the number two US diplomat in Moscow, the US State Department said, condemning the "unprovoked" action.Russia took over Ukraine's Crimea region and began backing heavily armed separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Lugansk regions in 2014, sparking a war that has already cost thousands of lives.Sporadic fighting remains common in the east, and the Ukrainian army accused the pro-Russian separatists of 34 ceasefire breaches on Thursday, 28 of them using heavy weapons.The potentially most serious incident -- an example of the kind of spark that many fear could ignite far more intense fighting -- was the shelling of a kindergarten in the village of Stanytsia-Luganska. Children were inside but none were hit.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted that the attack "by pro-Russian forces is a big provocation."Russian news agencies quoted authorities in the separatist Lugansk region saying they blamed Kyiv after the situation on the frontline "escalated significantly."Western capitals say they are also concerned by the Russian parliament's request that Putin grant unilateral recognition of independence for the separatists in eastern Ukraine."If this request were accepted, it would... demonstrate a Russian decision to choose a path of confrontation over dialogue," British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said.Putin earlier this week claimed with no evidence that Ukraine is committing "genocide" in the eastern region.Moscow has made several announcements of troop withdrawals this week and on Thursday said that tank units had begun returning to their bases from near Ukraine.The United States, NATO and Ukraine all said they had seen no evidence of a pullback, with Washington saying Russia had in fact moved 7,000 more troops near the border.According to US officials, there are now about 150,000 Russian troops arrayed in offensive groupings on the southern, eastern and northern borders of Ukraine.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  5 signs of a master manipulator, as per psychology5 traditional Indian hair oils for hair growthBigg Boss Kannada 11: Full and final list of contestantsFrom Golla getting his first seat on the flight to missing the last cable car in Interlaken; A look at Bharti Singh and Haarsh Limbachiyaa's first Europe Trip with their little munchkin5 sneakers you should stay away from; a Nike shoe is also on the list!5 body language tips to appear more confidentTop 5 Indian states with the highest per capita incomeWeekly Horoscope: September 30th to October 6th, 20247 vegetables that reduce belly fat quickly5 psychology tricks to make people magically like you123Hot PicksTirupati Laddu Case Hearing LiveDaylight Savings 2024Erika Carr UtahPakistan Job CutsNepal FloodsAir Canada FinedStock Market TodayTOP TRENDINGRafale Marine Flight JetsHarvard Application ProcessWho is Parita ParekhPaul HeymanDelhi Dwarka ExpresswayWWE Royal RumbleBad Blood 2024Carlos AlcarazMohammed SirajBrain Exercises to Boost MemoryTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website9 Timeless Skills That Will Always Be in Demand7 Effective Ways for Professionals to Enhance Productivity and Cultivate Inner Peace12 Effective Ways to Improve Handwriting for ExamsStock market crash today: BSE Sensex plunges over 1,200 points; Nifty50 ends below 25,850 - top reasons markets have tankedTNA Star Eric Young shared his thoughts on the docuseries about WWE’s former chairmanWho is Parita Parekh, youngest Indian entrepreneur and a Stanford alumnaSeventeen KIIT Athletics Who Participated in Paris Olympics & Paralympics Felicitated By Varsity'Team India ka Ghajini kaun hai?' - Rohit Sharma answers10 Common Habits That Could Be Hindering Your SuccessJ&K police head constable Bashir Ahmed killed after gunning down terrorist in Kathua encounterAs Biden calls for ceasefire, Israel tells US it will launch ground offensive in Lebanon soonHigh stakes in J&K polls phase 3: 415 candidates vie for 40 constituenciesKashmir’s ‘X factor’: Is he only a vote cutter or is he the real deal?'Fanatic theocrats leading you to abyss': Netanyahu warns IraniansMuda case: K'taka CM's wife offers to surrender 14 plotsSA20 Auction: Players, squads, date - everything you need to knowExplained: Silicon-carbon batteries have arrived in phones.

And scientists say the exceptionally hot year is part of a long-term warming trend that shows hints of accelerating. Two U.S. science agencies - NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - and a private measuring group released their calculations for last year's global temperature on Thursday, and all said it wasn't far behind ultra-hot 2016 and 2020. Six different calculations found 2021 was between the fifth and seventh hottest year since the late 1800s. NASA said 2021 tied with 2018 for sixth warmest, while NOAA puts last year in sixth place by itself, ahead of 2018. Scientists say a La Nina - natural cooling of parts of the central Pacific that changes weather patterns globally and brings chilly deep ocean water to the surface - dampened global temperatures just as its flip side, El Nino, boosted them in 2016.  Still, they said 2021 was the hottest La Nina year on record and that the year did not represent a cooling off of human-caused climate change but provided more of the same heat. "So it's not quite as headline-dominating as being the warmest on record, but give it another few years and we'll see another one of those" records, said climate scientist Zeke Hausfather of the Berkeley Earth monitoring group that also ranked 2021 the sixth hottest. "It's the long-term trend, and it's an indomitable march upward." Gavin Schmidt, the climate scientist who heads NASA's temperature team, said "the long-term trend is very, very clear. And it's because of us. And it's not going to go away until we stop increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere." The last eight years have been the eight hottest on record, NASA and NOAA data agree. Global temperatures, averaged over a 10-year period to take out natural variability, are nearly 2 degrees (1.1 degrees Celsius) warmer than 140 years ago, their data shows.  The other 2021 measurements came from the Japanese Meteorological Agency and satellite measurements by Copernicus Climate Change Service i n Europe and the University of Alabama in Huntsville. There was such a distinctive jump in temperatures about eight to 10 years ago that scientists have started looking at whether the rise in temperatures is speeding up. Both Schmidt and Hausfather said early signs point to that but it's hard to know for sure. "I think you can see the acceleration, but whether it's statistically robust is not quite clear," Schmidt said in an interview. "If you just look at the last the last 10 years, how many of them are way above the trend line from the previous 10 years? Almost all of them." The global average temperature last year was 58.5 degrees (14.7 Celsius), according to NOAA. In 1988, NASA's then-chief climate scientist James Hansen grabbed headlines when he testified to Congress about global warming in a year that was the hottest on record at the time. Now, the 57.7 degrees (14.3 Celsius) of 1988 ranks as the 28th hottest year on record.  Last year, 1.8 billion people in 25 Asian, African and Middle Eastern nations had their hottest years on record, including China, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Iran, Myanmar and South Korea, according to Berkeley Earth. The deep ocean, where most heat is stored in the seas, also set a record for warmth in 2021, according to a separate new study. "Ocean warming, aside from causing coral bleaching and threatening sea life and fish populations we rely upon for roughly 25% of our protein intake globally, is destabilizing Antarctic ice shelves and threatens massive ... sea level rise if we don't act," said study co-author Michael Mann, a Pennsylvania State University climate scientist. The last time Earth had a cooler than normal year by NOAA or NASA calculations was 1976. That means 69% of the people on the planet - more than 5 billion people under age 45 - have never experienced such a year, based on United Nations data. North Carolina state climatologist Kathie Dello, 39, who wasn't part of the new reports but said they make sense, said, "I've only lived in a warming world and I wish that the younger generations did not have to say the same. It didn't have to be this way."End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  Bigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial show5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the world​Bigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8​Bigg Boss 18: From Shehzada Dhami making serious allegations against Rajan Shahi to Alice Kaushik opening up about her parents’ demise: Major highlights from the show5 types of people one should completely avoid for peace in life, as per psychology10 most powerful countries in the world in 20245 minimalist habits to stop wasting your time​10 most educated countries of the world​From Aamir Khan's warm surprise with son Junaid to a musical tribute; A look at Amitabh Bachchan's 82nd Birthday celebration on the sets of Kaun Banega Crorepati 167 vegetables that reduce belly fat quicklyHow tall are Trump family membersTGIKS 2: From impersonating legendary cricketer MS Dhoni to revealing secrets from the World Cup: Top moments featuring Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and others123Hot PicksAssembly Election Result 2024 DateIsrael Hezbollah War Live2024 Nobel Prize in MedicineHaryana Assembly Constituencies 2024AIIMS Doctors Candle MarchPakistan Airport ExplosionChennai Air Show ChaosTOP TRENDINGElection Result Date and TimeKayla NicoleBasit AliWorld Richest FamilyThe San Francisco 49ersIsrael MossadRRB JE Exam DatePresident MuizzuJimmy UsosSadhguru QuotesTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteElection Results 2024 Live: Stage set in J&K, Haryana for first major BJP vs Congress showdown since Lok Sabha pollsTravis Kelce's Ex Kayla Nicole Delivers a Powerful 'Mental Health' Message While Facing Backlash from Taylor Swift Fans"Travis Kelce's career is over": Travis Kelce’s time in Kansas City may be numbered as the Chiefs decided to re-sign one of their familiar faces9 Powerful Quotes to Motivate Students Towards Success Through Hard WorkTop 10 Largest Economies In The World 2025: India To Become 4th Largest Economy Soon!

Israel on Thursday approved a fourth dose of vaccine for people with weakened immune systems, and Britain’s National Health Service said its hospitals would erect field wards to help deal with the surge in coronavirus cases.Several US states hit their all-time case records for coronavirus cases this week, disrupting the lives of millions of Americans. New York Mayor-elect Eric Adams vowed to keep the city’s vaccine mandate for private-sector employees in place, and the CDC issued a blunt warning to potential travelers: “Avoid cruise travel regardless of vaccination status.”Health officials are trying to encourage more Americans to get a booster shot — just over one-third of fully vaccinated adults have received one — and warn that the unvaccinated face the greatest risk of severe illness and death from omicron.“Our CDC guidance has been very clear that people should get their boost when they are eligible,” Dr. Rochelle PWalensky, the CDC director, told reporters this week. “That is both for — because of waning immunity and because we need more protection against Omicron.”Walensky said Wednesday that even as daily case counts had climbed by roughly 60% in the past week, hospitalizations and deaths were still relatively low, a suggestion that omicron might be less lethal. She and Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, cited international research hinting at the same conclusion.Studies have shown that while two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine have provided strong protection as the delta variant swarmed the country, omicron can evade the defenses of fully vaccinated people, heightening fears about the risks for young people.More than 70% of people 12 and older in the United States are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. Around one-quarter of children between 5 and 11 have received at least one dose. Children under 5 are still not eligible for a vaccine.The latest surge has caused a concerning rise in hospitalizations among children. But early data suggests that omicron appears to be causing milder illness for children, similar to findings for adults. And hospital officials and physicians have said that nearly all children hospitalized with Covid-19 were unvaccinated or partially vaccinated.Children can better withstand coronavirus infections but in rare instances can still become very sick and even die. At least 1.8 million adolescents between 12 and 15 years old have tested positive for the virus, according to the CDC.A series of studies published Thursday by the agency underscored how important vaccination can be for children and adolescents. In one study spanning July through early December that examined hundreds of adolescents in Arizona, researchers said two doses of the vaccine reduced the risk of infection by 92%.Two other CDC studies showed that there were few serious side effects reported among 5- to 11-year-olds who had received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and that pediatric hospitalizations occurred mostly among children who had not been fully vaccinated.A recent South African study showed that the effectiveness of Pfizer’s vaccine against severe illness and hospitalization was about 70% after two doses, against omicron in particular.Of the three federally authorized coronavirus shots, Pfizer-BioNTech's is the only vaccine approved for use in people under 18.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory committee is planning to meet by the middle of next week to weigh in on whether to recommend the changes in the FDA’s booster policy. If the committee agrees with the FDA’s authorizations, Walensky is expected to promptly endorse the revisions.Dr. Kathryn M. Edwards, a vaccine expert and professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said the FDA’s expected decision was justified.“We’re having a lot of suggestions and a lot of experience with omicron that it’s infecting people that have been boosted. But fortunately, we’re not seeing a lot of severe disease,” she said. “So I think if you look at the immune responses, at least in adults, you’ll see that this booster dose does enhance your neutralization capacity against omicron.”Other vaccine experts said the administration’s continued attention to offering boosters to younger, healthier people was misguided.Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, said research on vaccine effectiveness, including against omicron, had revealed that two doses offer substantial and durable protection against severe disease, including in adolescents — the purpose of vaccination, he said.A booster dose could increase a person's protection for several months, he said, but delivering extra shots to young Americans was “focusing on the people who are already protected.”The Biden administration, he added, should instead direct more attention to reaching the unvaccinated, a point he said was backed up by the overwhelming majority of hospitalized children he had seen in Philadelphia being unvaccinated.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the worldBigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial show​Bigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8​10 most powerful countries in the world in 20247 vegetables that reduce belly fat quickly​10 most educated countries of the world​How tall are Trump family membersTGIKS 2: From impersonating legendary cricketer MS Dhoni to revealing secrets from the World Cup: Top moments featuring Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and othersWhere the zodiac signs would prefer to liveFrom Bharti Singh- Elvish Yadav getting summoned in Rs 500 crore fraud case to Khushi Mali replacing Palak Sindhwani in Taarak Mehta: Top TV newsSunny Deol's 'Gadar', Shah Rukh Khan's 'Devdas', Rishi Kapoor's 'Chandni': Movies allegedly rejected by GovindaOptical illusion psychology test: The first thing you see reveals the hidden flaw affecting your relationships123Hot PicksIsrael Hezbollah War LiveBhopal Factory Drug SeizeGang Attack in HaitiAIIMS Doctors Candle MarchPakistan Airport ExplosionChennai Air Show ChaosHurricane Milton EvacuationTOP TRENDINGKarachi Airport BlastKayla NicoleWorld Richest FamilyThe San Francisco 49ersIsrael MossadPrince WilliamPresident MuizzuChinese Spy BallonsRishabh PantSadhguru QuotesTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website"Travis Kelce's career is over": Travis Kelce’s time in Kansas City may be numbered as the Chiefs decided to re-sign one of their familiar facesTravis Kelce's Ex Kayla Nicole Delivers a Powerful 'Mental Health' Message While Facing Backlash from Taylor Swift Fans'Diddy List': Names of celebrities connected to Sean Combs viral3 dead in Chennai after Indian Air Force air showFour spectators dead after Chennai air showPresident Muizzu in India: 'Will never hurt India's security interests, Maldives first but will prioritise ties with India'1 dead, 10 injured in massive explosion near Karachi airportIAF quietly shooting down 'Chinese spy balloons' at high altitudes'Wouldn't have given birth': Gaza mother struggles to provide for newborns amid conflictRishabh Pant's Masterclass: How India conquered the fortress GabbaMiracle at 17,000 ft: How two US & UK climbers were rescued from HimalayasRahul's heartfelt cooking session with Dalit man, his family;

Lance Lowry (Agency photo) NEW YORK: At a Georgia state House of Representatives hearing on prison conditions in September, a corrections officer called in to testify, interrupting his shift to tell lawmakers how dire conditions had become. On a "good day," he told lawmakers, he had maybe six or seven officers to supervise roughly 1,200 people. He said he had recently been assigned to look after 400 prisoners by himself.There weren't enough nurses to provide medical care. "All the officers ... absolutely despise working there," said the officer, who didn't give his name for fear of retaliation. In Texas, Lance Lowry quit after 20 years as a corrections officer to become a long-haul trucker because he couldn't bear the job any longer. Watching friends and coworkers die from COVID-19, along with dwindling support from his superiors, wore on him. "I would have liked to stay till I was 50," said Lowry, 48. "But the pandemic changed that." Staff shortages have long been a challenge for prison agencies, given the low pay and grueling nature of the work. But the coronavirus pandemic - and its impact on the labor market - has pushed many corrections systems into crisis. Officers are retiring and quitting in droves, while officials struggle to recruit new employees. And some prisons whose populations dropped during the pandemic have seen their numbers rise again, exacerbating the problem. There is no one thing pushing prison employees out in high numbers now. Some are leaving for new opportunities as more places are hiring. University of Michigan economist Betsey Stevenson pointed to the increased risk of COVID-19 for people working in prisons. "When jobs become riskier, it becomes harder to attract workers," she wrote in an email. "By failing to protect prisoners from COVID, the criminal justice system not only created an unfair risk of severe illness and death for the incarcerated, but the increased COVID risk to employees has undoubtedly contributed to staffing shortages." Unions representing prison officers in states including Massachusetts and California and at the federal level also claim vaccine mandates will drive out unvaccinated employees and exacerbate understaffing, though it's unclear how big of an impact those rules will have. "There are dozens of reasons to leave and very few to stay," said Brian Dawe, national director of One Voice United, a nonprofit supporting corrections officers. "Understaffing, poor pay, poor benefits, horrendous working conditions. Officers and their families in many jurisdictions have had enough." Employers from construction companies to restaurants are having difficulty hiring and keeping people. Nearly 3% of American workers, 4.3 million, quit their jobs in August, according to new data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the stakes are higher in prisons, where having fewer guards means significantly more dangerous conditions for incarcerated people. And for the officers left behind, worsening shortages have made an already difficult job unbearable, many say. In Georgia, some prisons report up to 70% vacancy rates. In Nebraska, overtime hours have quadrupled since 2010, as fewer officers are forced to work longer hours. Florida has temporarily closed three prisons out of more than 140 because of understaffing, and vacancy rates have nearly doubled there in the last year. And at federal prisons across the country, guards are picketing in front of their facilities over understaffing, while everyone from prison teachers to dentists is pulled in to cover security shifts. In recent weeks, reporters from The Marshall Project and The Associated Press have spoken with workers, officials, attorneys and people incarcerated in more than a dozen prison systems to understand the consequences of the staffing shortfalls. The federal Bureau of Prisons says about 93% of its front-line guard positions are filled, with little more than 1,000 vacancies, though workers in many prisons say they're feeling the pinch as others are conscripted to fill in for missing officers. Asked last week in a U.S. Senate hearing about federal prison staffing, Attorney General Merrick Garland said, "I agree this is a serious problem at the Bureau of Prisons." Garland told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco was working with the bureau to address staffing issues. Inside prisons, growing shortages mean a rise in lockdowns. Restrictions that might have begun as a way to stop the spread of COVID-19 have continued because there aren't enough guards to supervise activities. Some incarcerated people say they can't take classes, participate in group therapy sessions or even work out in the recreation yard or take a shower. That can force those in general population into de facto solitary confinement, and those already in segregation into near-total lockdown. "If we get rec once a week, that's a good week," said Anthony Haynes, who is on Texas' death row in a unit that is barely half-staffed. "We don't always get showers." A spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice did not respond to Haynes' claims but acknowledged that staffing is a challenge in Texas' prisons. "Before COVID-19, staffing was frequently impacted by economic surges and competing employment opportunities," said spokesman Robert Hurst in an email. "The pandemic has exacerbated these issues. We also recognize that the job of the correctional officer is one of the most difficult in all of state government." He added that Texas has closed six of its more than 100 facilities in the last year due to staffing problems. Kansas has cut job training and reduced supervision for people after they're released. Two-thirds of the men in Nebraska's prisons can't see visitors on the weekends - when most families are free to travel - because of understaffing. Dr. Homer Venters, a former chief medical officer for the jail system in New York City, inspects conditions in prisons around the country for court cases. Understaffing will lead to an increase in preventable prison deaths, he said, as the quality of care reaches new lows. "Things are much worse behind bars now than they have been for a long time," Venters said. "There are so many staff that have left. That means that basic clinical services, like getting to scheduled appointments, just isn't happening the way it was even five years ago."End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  Bigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial showSchengen visa denials: 5 countries with the highest rejection ratesSanjay Dutt-Manyata to Hardik Pandya-Natasa Stankovic: Bollywood couples who renewed their wedding vows5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the world8 animals that help Earth heal and how5 psychology tips to be more mature in life and relationships10 most powerful countries in the world in 2024From getting kicked out from Shark Tank India 4 to marrying a Mexico-based model, buying India’s first : Times when Deepinder Goyal made headlines​Bigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8​123Hot PicksUS Election Timeline 2024World's Fastest JetsDelhi Drugs in NamkeenHarris vs Trump Latest PollsUP Scholarships Non-Creamy LayerMahadev Betting AppStock market todayTOP TRENDINGRic FlairNavi Mumbai AirportPrince HarryNFL Week SeasonActor NithinIPL FranchisesAyudha Puja DateRatan TataKali Crown BangladeshDiddy ListTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website“When you know, you know”: Russell Wilson’s Wife Ciara Revealed That She Knew Wilson Was The One After Their First DateTollywood actor Nithin arrested for snatching gold chain in HyderabadRatan Tata’s successor: Noel Tata appointed chairman of Tata TrustsDiwali 2024 Date: When is Deepawali?

(Agency photo) NEW YORK: US President Thomas Jefferson's statue, a presence for more than a century in the New York City Council chamber, is coming down following a public commission reassessment of the legacy of the founding father who was also a slaveholder. The New York City Public Design Commission voted unanimously on Monday to dismantle the 7-foot (2.13-meter) bronze likeness of Jefferson, which has watched over proceedings in the most populous U.S.city since 1915. The commission agreed to lend the 187-year-old statue long-term to the New-York Historical Society. It is a plaster model of a statue still on display in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. "Jefferson embodied some of the most shameful parts of our country's long and nuanced history," Councilperson Adrienne Adams, co-chair of the council's Black, Latino and Asian Caucus, told the commission. "It is time for the city to turn the page and move forward." Similar monuments have become a target of anti-racism protests in recent years. Statues of Civil War Confederate leaders have also been dismantled.Jefferson's place in U.S. history is complex. Having written that "all men are created equal" as the primary author of the Declaration of Independence, he also enslaved more than 600 people and fathered at least six children with Sally Hemings, a woman he enslaved. Not everyone supported the removal of the statue. Sean Wilentz, a American history professor at Princeton University, wrote in a letter read to the commission: "The statue specifically honors Jefferson for his greatest contribution to America, indeed, to humankind."

(Getty Images)  WASHINGTON: Pakistan and its intelligence service have played a key role in fostering the Taliban and allowing it to eventually take over Afghanistan, a top Republican lawmaker has alleged, stating that it is disgusting to watch Islamabad celebrate the group's victory that will bring "untold brutality" to Afghans.Congressman Steve Chabot, Co-Chair of the India Caucus, said in his address to the virtual gala of Hindu Political Action Committee on Sunday that he applauds the Indian government for welcoming the Afghan religious minorities who have a good reason to fear persecution at the hands of the Taliban and their evil rule.“In contrast, we all know that Pakistan and particularly its intelligence services played a key role fostering the Taliban and allowing them to eventually take over. It's just disgusting to watch Pakistani officials celebrate the victory of this group that will bring untold brutality to the Afghan people,” Chabot said.“Pakistan's own persecution of religious minorities, however, gets a lot less attention here in America than it deserves. We would do well to educate our fellow citizens about these abuses. Persecution is particularly manifests in the heinous practice of the kidnapping, force conversion to Islam and forced marriage of underage Hindu girls to older Muslim men,” he said.Such allegations are not mere hearsay, he noted.Major news organisations and human rights groups have documented the practice with so many heartbreaking stories of girls in their early teens taken from their families, and traffic into forced marriages. These abuses are often just ignored, said the Congressman.In his address, Chabot said that with roughly 6 million Hindus in America, Hindus are unquestionably an integral part of society throughout the United States.“Through strong work ethic and high educational attainment, Hindus exemplify the American dream. These virtues also allow Hindus to take on key roles in communities across the country, and also give back to those communities in so many ways,” he said.That is why the reports of a rise in discrimination against Hindu Americans around the country are so concerning, he rued, adding that there is no place in America for such discrimination.“We must all seek ways to bring it to an end,” Chabot added.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  Bigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial show5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the world​Bigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8​Bigg Boss 18: From Shehzada Dhami making serious allegations against Rajan Shahi to Alice Kaushik opening up about her parents’ demise: Major highlights from the show5 types of people one should completely avoid for peace in life, as per psychology10 most powerful countries in the world in 20245 minimalist habits to stop wasting your time​10 most educated countries of the world​From Aamir Khan's warm surprise with son Junaid to a musical tribute; A look at Amitabh Bachchan's 82nd Birthday celebration on the sets of Kaun Banega Crorepati 167 vegetables that reduce belly fat quicklyHow tall are Trump family membersTGIKS 2: From impersonating legendary cricketer MS Dhoni to revealing secrets from the World Cup: Top moments featuring Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and others123Hot PicksAssembly Election Result 2024 DateIsrael Hezbollah War Live2024 Nobel Prize in MedicineHaryana Assembly Constituencies 2024AIIMS Doctors Candle MarchPakistan Airport ExplosionChennai Air Show ChaosTOP TRENDINGElection Result Date and TimeKayla NicoleBasit AliWorld Richest FamilyThe San Francisco 49ersIsrael MossadRRB JE Exam DatePresident MuizzuJimmy UsosSadhguru QuotesTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteElection Results 2024 Live: Stage set in J&K, Haryana for first major BJP vs Congress showdown since Lok Sabha pollsTravis Kelce's Ex Kayla Nicole Delivers a Powerful 'Mental Health' Message While Facing Backlash from Taylor Swift Fans"Travis Kelce's career is over": Travis Kelce’s time in Kansas City may be numbered as the Chiefs decided to re-sign one of their familiar faces9 Powerful Quotes to Motivate Students Towards Success Through Hard WorkTop 10 Largest Economies In The World 2025: India To Become 4th Largest Economy Soon!

(Reuters Photo) WASHINGTON: Democrats face a test of unity in the US House of Representatives on Monday as they begin work on two ambitious spending plans that would devote trillions of dollars to transportation infrastructure and social programs.While centrist Democrats are eager to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that has already won approval in the Senate, liberals say they must prioritize a $3.5 trillion budget blueprint that would expand spending on child care and education.Both measures are priorities for Democratic President Joe Biden.The first test will come on Monday evening when the House is due to vote on a package that would advance both spending bills, as well as a separate voting rights proposal.That would clear the way for a final vote on the budget plan and the voting rights bill on Tuesday, but would not set a timeline for passage of the infrastructure bill.Nine moderates who are pushing the House to first pass the infrastructure bill have threatened to vote against the package. That could potentially scuttle it in the House, where Democrats hold a 220-212 majority."There is a standoff with some of our colleagues who have decided to hold the infrastructure bill hostage for months, or kill it altogether if they don’t get what they want in the next bill," they wrote in the Washington Post on Monday.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has sided with liberals who worry they might lose leverage on the social spending effort if they first pass the infrastructure bill. She wants the House to complete work on both bills by Oct. 1."Any delay to passing the budget resolution threatens the timetable for delivering the historic progress and the transformative vision that Democrats share," Pelosi wrote fellow Democrats on Saturday.No Republicans are expected to support the budget resolution plan, which sets the broad outline for spending on education, childcare, healthcare and climate measures favoured by Biden and pays for them with tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations.Crucially, the budget resolution plan would allow Democrats to pass those spending measures on a simple majority vote in the Senate, rather than the 60 votes required for most legislation in that chamber.The Senate is split 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats. Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris has the power, however, to cast the tie-breaking vote.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  Bigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial show​Bigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8​5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the worldFrom 'Bigg Boss' star to fitness icon: Shehnaaz Gill's inspiring weight loss journey10 most powerful countries in the world in 2024Universe Guidance For Each Zodiac SignTop 10 Largest Economies In The World 2025: India To Become 4th Largest Economy Soon!

(Reuters Photo)  WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden is brushing off criticism of his administration's chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal because he and his aides believe the political fallout at home will be limited, according to White House allies and administration officials.Biden and his top aides argue they are managing an evacuation mission https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/afghanistan-edge-after-anti-taliban-protest-east-kabul-calm-airlift-goes-2021-08-19 as well as could be expected given the faster-than-anticipated takeover of the country by the Taliban, and are seeking to draw attention back to the choice to get U.S.troops out of the country.The strategy is based on internal and public polling that shows the Afghanistan withdrawal had been by far the most popular decision Biden has made, even though the issue was not central for most voters."The public opinion is pretty damn clear that Americans wanted out of the ongoing war and don't want to get back in. It's true today and it's going to be true in six months," said one Biden ally. "It isn't about not caring or being empathetic about what's going on over there but worrying about what's happening in America."Biden has faced criticism even from some fellow Democrats for his handling of the crisis.But White House officials believe Americans' horror over graphic images https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/small-afghan-girl-is-lifted-crowd-capturing-desperation-flee-kabul-2021-08-19 of the chaos in Kabul and pleas from Afghans who fear they will be killed by the Taliban will morph into support for the president's decision to pull troops from the country by Aug. 31 after a 20-year war.They expect the Afghanistan story to recede from the headlines, replaced by the resurgence in COVID-19 cases, the economic recovery and other issues, people familiar with the matter said.A White House spokesperson declined to comment.Biden aides honed talking points weeks ago to be used even in the worst-case scenarios of a withdrawal, some of which have come to pass, including emphasizing that leaving Afghanistan was the right decision."The idea that somehow, there's a way to have gotten out without chaos ensuing, I don't know how that happens," Biden told ABC News on Wednesday. "There is no good time to leave Afghanistan. Fifteen years ago would've been a problem, 15 years from now. The basic choice is am I going to send your sons and your daughters to war in Afghanistan in perpetuity?"In recent days, Biden has also assailed the Afghan military for refusing to fight, denounced the now-ousted Afghan government and declared he inherited a bad withdrawal agreement from his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump.The strategy has obvious risks, political experts say. "The concern is that it's going to undercut his credibility as commander in chief," said Jim Manley, once a top aide to former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. "If the Taliban revert to what they've done in the past, and I assume that's going to be the case, it's going to be a lot of bad images coming out of that country."INADEQUATE RESPONSEThe Afghanistan messaging is increasingly at odds with an emerging consensus within the administration that the White House, Defense and State departments as well as the U.S. intelligence community's planning for the current situation was inadequate and needs to be fully reviewed once the mission of evacuating key people from Afghanistan is complete and the 5,200 U.S. troops now in Kabul are gone."We're at the Pentagon and even we know it could have been better," said one official. "A lot better." Members of the U.S. Congress also plan to investigate what went wrong.Public opinion, at least for now, is mixed. A majority of both Republican and Democratic voters say https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-approval-drops-lowest-level-this-year-after-taliban-takeover-2021-08-17 the swift capitulation of the Afghan government "is evidence why the U.S. should get out of the conflict."Reuters/Ipsos polling this week found that 31% of American adults agreed that the United States should continue its military operations in Afghanistan, up from the 25% who felt the same way in a 2012 poll.Yet Ipsos polling https://tmsnrt.rs/3k4cwxs conducted on Monday also showed fewer than half of Americans liked the way Biden had steered the U.S. military and diplomatic effort in Afghanistan this year. They currently rate his performance worse than the other three presidents who presided over the United States' longest war, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Trump.Biden's overall approval sank to 46% of American adults in Reuters/Ipsos polling, the lowest recorded in weekly polls since he took office in January.Republicans, including Trump, have started weaponizing the withdrawal as an issue to undermine faith in Biden as commander in chief.Most Democrats are likely to embrace public support of the withdrawal decision, and the issue should die down before the November 2022 congressional elections, said one adviser working on Democratic congressional campaigns.She added, however: "The Biden administration will likely have to defend every negative headline that comes out of Afghanistan during his tenure, so that is a real unknown."End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  From being 3 months pregnant while sitting on the hotseat to her son calling Amitabh Bachchan 'dadu'; Shruthy Daga opens up about her 'arranged marriage', KBC14 Journey and more9 morning habits that can bring down cholesterol levels within a monthLaughter Chefs: From Bharti Singh- Krushna Abhishek getting emotional to Nia Sharma getting teary eyed on missing Sudesh Lehri: Top moments from the recent episodeAstro-Numerology October 2024: Sanjay B Jumaani's Predictions for Each Number (1-9)5 traditional Indian hair oils for hair growth5 herbal drinks that help in reducing blood sugar levelsHappy Gandhi Jayanti 2024: Images, Wishes, Messages, Quotes, Pictures and Greeting CardsFrom Prince Narula - Yuvika Chaudhary to Keith Sequeira - Rochelle Maria Rao; Couples who found love in the Bigg Boss houseOptical illusion psychology test: What you see first reveals what you truly want in a relationship5 body language tips to appear more confidentWinter is coming: 5 places in India for a winter vacation in October5 signs of a master manipulator, as per psychology123Hot PicksIsrael Hezbollah War LiveOldest Miss UniverseErika Carr UtahPakistan Job CutsJ&K Phase 3 Elections LiveAir Canada FinedStock Market TodayTOP TRENDINGTimeless SkillHelicopter Crashes PuneIran Israel ConflictIND vs PAK T20 World CupBrittany MahomesMorne MorkelGaurav TanejaMichael VaughanRahul GandhiBrain Exercises to Boost MemoryTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website"Tears of Joy and Sorrow: Brittany Mahomes’ Heartfelt Reflection Amid Family Health Struggles"'Diddy List': Names of celebrities connected to Sean Combs viralHow tall is JD Vance?

The Daniel K Inouye Solar Telescope, at the summit of Haleakalā volcano on Maui, was supposed to open last fall. But Thomas Rimmele told Hawaii Public Radio on Wednesday that the Covid-19 travel restrictions set back construction on its critical systems.He hopes the current schedule won't be affected by newly surging coronavirus cases and any additional restrictions. Rimmele was expecting to return to Maui as early as this week. "November 15 is what we're shooting for. We just had a big review, the final construction review that was conducted by the National Science Foundation," Rimmele said. "(The scientists) are getting really anxious to get their observations and data done." The telescope has received about 100 proposals from researchers for an initial observing window of two-and-a-half months. Picking, which scientists get to go first, depends heavily on atmospheric conditions and what objects are visible on a given day.  He said one quarter or even a fifth of the proposals may be approved for the first cycle. "We are highly oversubscribed and people will have to submit proposals again for the next cycle," he said. "That's just how it works."The National Solar Observatory said the Inouye telescope will be able to reveal features three times smaller than anything scientists are able to see on the Sun currently. The Hawaii Supreme Court in 2016 affirmed a permit for the solar telescope's construction. The next year, more than 100 protesters tried to block a construction convoy heading to the telescope site, citing the sacredness of Haleakala's summit. Maui police had then arrested six people. Protests against another telescope planned for a different mountain and island -- the Thirty Meter Telescope at the summit of Mauna Kea on the Big Island -- have prevented construction crews from working on that project.

Whenever I see Yuvi bhaiya (Yuvraj Singh), it gives me a lot of motivation," she said.PollDo you believe India will win their first ICC women's title in the upcoming World Cup?Yes, absolutely!No, they will fall short.India have reached the final on multiple occasions — most memorably in 2017 when they finished runners-up in England — but are yet to clinch the elusive crown. The World Cup begins September 30, preceded by a crucial home ODI series against defending champions and tournament favourites Australia from September 14."Playing against Australia is always challenging and we get to know what is our standing. The series will give us a lot of confidence. We have been putting a lot of effort in our training camps and the results are showing," Harmanpreet noted.With the trophy now touring India and the team buoyed by recent wins in England, Harmanpreet believes this World Cup could finally end India’s wait for global glory.“There is a larger picture here which has to do with what this means to the country. The growth of women’s cricket in many ways is a reflection of the country’s progress,” said ICC CEO Sanjog Gupta. “It normalises women occupying spaces which were traditionally occupied by men. It normalises women being outdoors. It also creates an opportunity for both men and women to come out and support Team India, not just the men in blue but the women in blue.”Gupta continued, “In every sense, the growth of women’s cricket over the last eight years has brought up to this moment where it is time for women’s cricket to take the next leap. This World Cup can be the springboard for that next leap.” "World Cups are more than just events, they are apertures for building trans-generational legacies and foster new cultures."Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Azharuddin made the remarks at the launch of Kirmani’s autobiography ‘Stumped: Life Behind and Beyond The Twenty-Two Yards’."He is the number one wicket-keeper in the world. Such a wicket-keeper was never born. It was not easy for him to do wicketkeeping with four spinners. He took many good catches in the World Cup in 1983. Even in the match when Kapil scored 175 runs, he scored crucial 24 runs. I am very happy to attend this event today. May god give him a long life. People should also read this book and enjoy, and I hope it is successful," Azharuddin said.MS Dhoni returns as CSK Captain, confirms coach Stephen FlemingGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

He bowled very well. I would like to congratulate him as well. I hope he continues to grow and perform well," Azharuddin said.Siraj finished as the leading wicket-taker in the five-match Test series, with 23 wickets, and bowled the most overs (185.3) among all players.

He said: “All Mumbai players should play the Kanga League. Some players feel that if they fail here, it’ll be bad for their future.“But if Gavaskar sir and Sachin Tendulkar sir thought the same way, they might not have gone on to become legends.“If big players participate in this tournament, it will be an inspiration for the city’s youngsters.“Kanga League is such a tournament that if you succeed here, you can score runs anywhere in the world.”Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Virat Kohli (AP Photo) NEW DELHI: Speculation over the ODI futures of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma has intensified, but the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) appears in no hurry to make a decisive call on the two icons.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!With the August home series against Bangladesh called off, India’s next ODI assignment will be an away series against Australia from October 19–25. Whether Kohli and Rohit will feature in ODIs beyond that tour remains uncertain.Virat Kohli on why did he retire from Test cricket: 'It's time when you...'According to reports, one proposal being discussed in BCCI circles is for the duo to tune up for Australia by featuring in a couple of India A matches against Australia A in Kanpur (September 30, October 3, October 5), coinciding with the senior team’s first Test against the West Indies in Ahmedabad.An intriguing question — if they need List A match practice — is when Kohli last played such a game outside of ODIs. The answer takes us back 12 years, to the NKP Salve Challenger Trophy in Indore in 2013. Then Delhi skipper Kohli turned out for his state side in a clash against India Blue, which also featured current head coach Gautam Gambhir as opening batter and sharing the XI with Virender Sehwag and Ashish Nehra. Delhi fell short by 50 runs chasing 275, with Kohli scoring 23 off 28 balls, striking five fours, in the final.That Challenger Trophy ended with Delhi losing the final to India Blue, captained by Yuvraj Singh, with Bhuvneshwar Kumar taking 4 for 39 to seal the Man of the Match award. Kohli was run out in the 10th over of the run chase. Kohli is now the only active player from that Delhi team.Both Kohli, now based in London, and Rohit have been on extended breaks since the IPL. While Kohli has posted videos of indoor net sessions, Rohit recently returned to Mumbai and is expected to resume training shortly. Whether they walk out in blue again after October could hinge on decisions made in the coming weeks.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Harry Gill takes a one-handed stunner during Australia vs South Africa first T20I match in Darwin.

SUBSCRIBE NOW!In the 12th over of Australia’s innings against South Africa, Tim David hammered a flat six into the crowd, where Gill pulled off a one-handed stunner with his left hand while holding both drinks in his right — without spilling a drop.“The lemonade ones are bloody good. I’ve got a bit of a hangover this morning,” Gill was quoted as saying by The Age.“It just stuck. My hand is a bit sore this morning but, yeah, happy with it. My phone is blowing up,” said the 26-year-old pilot from Darwin.Gill’s grab has been compared to the famous crowd catch taken by Channel Nine cameraman Tony Fox in 1987, when Ian Botham launched Simon O’Donnell down the ground for six.Fox took it with both hands — cigarette in mouth.Gill admitted his dad had sent him the clip, but he isn’t putting himself in the same league.PollWas Harry Gill's catch more impressive than the famous catch by Tony Fox in 1987?Yes, definitely!No, Tony Fox's catch was iconic.Both were amazing in their own right.“His is so much cooler, bro,” Gill said. “I wish I had a durry [cigarette] in my mouth so I could have done that.“The South African cricketer in front of me said it was a pretty good catch.”Former Australian cricketer and Fox commentator Mark Waugh, referring to the 1987 effort, said of Gill’s catch: “You just need a smoke and you’d be right at home.”Tim David bludgeoned eight sixes in his robust 83 to lead Australia to a 17-run win over South Africa in the first T20 on Sunday, as international cricket returned to Darwin after 17 years.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

'They will lose to India’: Ex-cricketer doubts Aus & SA’s WTC final chances
Aakash Chopra suggested that both Australia and South Africa, the finalists of the previous WTC cycle, might face difficulties in reaching the 2027 final. Despite Australia's strong start, their tour of India and an aging bowling attack could hinder their progress. South Africa's challenging away series in the subcontinent also diminish their chances of qualifying, according to Chopra.

Team Australia (Getty Images) NEW DELHI: Former India opener Aakash Chopra believes that Australia and South Africa — the two finalists of the 2023-25 World Test Championship (WTC) cycle — may struggle to reach the summit clash of the next cycle in 2027.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Speaking on his YouTube channel, Chopra, who was analysing the newly drawn fixtures, said that despite Australia’s dominant start to the 2025–27 WTC cycle, their path will be far from straightforward. Australia currently top the table with 100 percentage points after a 3-0 away sweep against West Indies.Bold prediction! Astrologer Greenstone Lobo picks winner of Australia vs South Africa WTC Final 2025“Their home series are against New Zealand, England and Bangladesh. They will 100 percent win against Bangladesh. They should win against New Zealand. They should win against England as well. However, it’s a five-match series, so they are unlikely to get full points,” Chopra said.PollWhich team is more likely to struggle in the next WTC cycle?AustraliaSouth AfricaBoth teams equallyPointing to the India tour as a potential stumbling block, he added: “I feel they will leave India after losing to them. They might win just one match. If they win only one match, they will lose a lot of points. South Africa will challenge them again. So it is not that straightforward. Decent chance, but I won’t say strong contenders.”Current WTC Point TableChopra also flagged Australia’s ageing bowling attack, warning of an imminent transition period that could impact results.The former opener was equally sceptical about defending champions South Africa’s prospects, noting their challenging schedule. “Australia, England and Bangladesh are South Africa’s home series. Australia and England are tough, and they will beat Bangladesh. The away series are against India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. South Africa have less chances. All three of their away series are in the subcontinent. They will find it difficult to even draw all three of those series,” he said.“South Africa, in my opinion, might not qualify. There is a good chance of them not qualifying,” Chopra concluded.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Dubai: India's Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli during the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 final cricket match between India and New Zealand, in Dubai, UAE. (PTI Photo/Arun Sharma) Former India opener and ex-selector Devang Gandhi believes the younger crop has shown they are ready for all challenges, casting doubt on Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli’s ODI futures.“How will you make players like Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rishabh Pant, Sai Sudharsan, among others, sit out when they have shown how well they can adapt? The bigger transition is from T20s to Tests. Once a player has done well in Test cricket and has the power game, ODIs should come easier to them. It is very important that the selectors and the team management sit together and take a call,” Gandhi told TOI.Greenstone Lobo predicts Virat Kohli & Rohit Sharma's ODI futureGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Gandhi stressed that regular game-time is crucial and urged the selectors to honestly assess whether Virat and Rohit can remain at their peak over the next two years.“If, say, in a year’s time, we come to a situation where one of them is not firing and we need a replacement, the team management may not have enough time to prepare a player for the job,” Gandhi said.The captaincy question is equally important, and the selectors must make a decision. Gill has already proven himself ready to lead in Tests and, given his current form, is arguably India’s best ODI batsman, averaging 59.04 with a strike rate of 99.56. His performances have earned him the team’s respect, making the ODI captaincy a natural fit.PollShould Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli continue playing ODIs?Yes, they should continueNo, it's time for younger playersOnly if they perform wellUndecided“There’s absolutely no doubt about the contribution of Rohit and Virat. But time doesn’t wait for anybody,” Gandhi added.With Rohit and Virat — who retired from T20Is in 2024 and stepped away from Test cricket earlier this year — the speculation about their ODI future has been rife. For now, though, it appears they may give one final push to the format they dominated for over 15 years.If they wish to extend their ODI careers beyond October, both may need to feature in domestic one-day competitions like the Vijay Hazare Trophy in December, as well as the ‘A’ series against Australia and South Africa, in addition to international fixtures.At this stage of their careers, however, there remains uncertainty over whether these legends would be willing to endure the grind of domestic one-day cricket in far-flung venues once again.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

LUCKNOW: India pacer Akash Deep has been spending quality time with his family after a fruitful tour of England. On Saturday, he also paid a visit to Lucknow to meet his sisters on the occasion of Rakshabandhan. Despite his busy schedule, Akash Deep took time out to talk to TOI on his experiences of the long English tour.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Opening up on the controversy involving Ben Duckett during the Oval Test, Akash Deep revealed that he told Duckett that he won't be the only one to hit and he would hit too. Akash Deep gave a sendoff to the England opener by putting his hand around his shoulder and uttering a few words to him after dismissing him. The images went viral.Akash Deep press conference: On replacing Jasprit Bumrah, message from Gautam Gambhir and more"On a cricket field, you need to keep a cool head. I told Duckett, 'You won't be the only one hitting; I'll hit too. Sometimes you miss, and I hit'."Akash Deep said that Duckett had told him that he would not be able to dismiss him and whatever he said to Duckett was in response. “It was quite a good experience. Every pace bowler wants to play in England. Although the wickets were not as we had expected, we still put our heart and soul into every match to end the hard-fought series on even terms. The series was a great learning for me.”PollShould more cricketers dedicate their performances to loved ones facing challenges?Absolutely, it inspires others.It depends on personal preference."Taking ten wickets individually in a match (at Edgbaston, which India won) is quite significant but scoring a half century for the team was more important to me. While I was working on my half-century, the only thing on my mind was not to get out and to keep playing," he added.Asked about dedicating his 10-wicket match haul in the second Test at Birmingham to his elder sister who is suffering from cancer, he said, "My message was not just for my sister; it was for the entire country and the world, emphasizing the importance of standing by loved ones during difficult times."On the final day of the last Test at the Oval, Akash Deep remembers, "I woke up early due to excitement, knowing we needed four wickets, and England wanted just 35 runs, and that only we three pacers had to do it. But we believed in ourselves, and the England batters apparently panicked. We didn't know the ball would start swinging in the morning, but once it did, we realized the wickets would fall quickly, and that's what happened."On his partner in attack, Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep said, "As a fast bowler, he is fit, and the way he puts in effort behind the ball sets him apart. Playing five consecutive matches is commendable. From this, one learns that being mentally fit is more important than being physically fit."Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Former New Zealand all-rounder Craig McMillan lauded Shubman Gill's captaincy during the recent Test series against England, emphasising the importance of establishing a distinct team identity.

File Pic: India's Shubman Gill, Arshdeep Singh, and Hardik Pandya. (PTI Photo) CHENNAI: Shubman Gill marshalled his troops admirably in his maiden Test series as India captain, eventually pulling off a 2-2 draw against hosts England. Gill earned praise from former New Zealand all-rounder Craig McMillan, who stressed that the new skipper should create a “style of play” which the team sticks to during his captaincy tenure. Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!During an interaction in Chennai, McMillan – the assistant coach of the NZ women’s side that is training at the Super Kings Academy as part of their preparation for the 50-over World Cup — also spoke about India missing a Hardik Pandya-type player in Tests, England’s ‘Bazball’ and more. Excerpts:India vs England, 5th Test Day 3: Why Shubman Gill holds key, Jazball vs Bazball!Gill’s captaincy skills were tested in England. What do you make of his leadership?He looks a good captain. The first series is very tough. In such a pressure-cooked series, he probably made a few mistakes. But you expect those in his first series. He will get better with experience. He is the future, so India will invest in him. He will get to know his team’s game, which I think is really important, and the style of play.How do India want to play under Gill?When India had played under Virat Kohli, everyone knew how they had played — they had been aggressive. It might be a bit different because of the personality of Gill. He has got to work that out with the coach Gautam Gambhir.Washington Sundar, Ravindra Jadeja and Ben Stokes had huge roles to play. How vital is it to have genuine allrounders in Tests?In Asian conditions, you need a spin-bowling allrounder like Jadeja, Washington or previously R Ashwin. In NZ, Australia and England, you need a fast-bowling allrounder. It is where India are missing a player like Hardik Pandya who can bowl medium pace and bat lower down the order. For England, Ben Stokes is two players in one.England head coach Brendon McCullum is a former teammate of yours. What are your thoughts on his coaching philosophy?Brendon has always been an aggressive operator. He is a real positive man as well. It is no surprise that he has pushed that philosophy with England – being proactive and pushing the game forward. And England have certainly played better under him than they did under the previous regime. It has made for entertaining cricket at timesCan ‘Bazball’ be effective in all conditions?I do not think that you can play one style all over the world. If England are smart enough (during the Ashes), they will adapt because Australia have got a quality bowling attack. If you make mistakes in Australia, you get sorted out pretty quickly.Should there be a two-tier model for Test cricket?I do not think that it will be good for the world game. The ‘Big Three’ (India, Australia and England) need to support the other teams. Some countries do not have the resources that they have. It would be a bit of a mistake if it is split into two.Coming to the Women’s World Cup, how has NZ’s preparation been?The World Cup is not that far away, so to come to India and expose some of our girls to what we are likely to face, is hugely beneficial. The time we have had at the academy has been outstanding. It is a beneficial trip, which will help us come WC time.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

'Bumrah should’ve been told to miss IPL': Vengsarkar defends pacer against critics
Former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar believed Jasprit Bumrah should have skipped IPL 2025 to stay fresh for the England Test series. He also suggested that Virat Kohli should have played the series before retiring. Vengsarkar emphasised the importance of Test cricket, highlighting standout performances from Siraj, Gill, Rahul, Jaiswal, Pant and Sundar. He defended Bumrah's workload management, citing his back surgery.

He also suggested that Virat Kohli should have played the series before retiring. Vengsarkar emphasised the importance of Test cricket, highlighting standout performances from Siraj, Gill, Rahul, Jaiswal, Pant and Sundar. He defended Bumrah's workload management, citing his back surgery. Dilip Vengsarkar and Jasprit Bumrah MUMBAI: Wading into the debate around Jasprit Bumrah's workload management, which saw him play just three out of five Tests in England, former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar has asserted that India's ace pacer should have been asked by the decision-makers in Indian cricket to miss IPL-2025 to keep himself refreshed and well-rested for the iconic India versus England five-Test series this summer, which ended in a 2-2 stalemate.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"Considering the importance of the India versus England Tests series and his fragile back, Bumrah should have been told by the BCCI, selectors and the Indian team management to miss IPL-2025. It was very important that we had a fully fit and refreshed Bumrah for this iconic series. If I was the India chief selector, I would have convinced Mukesh Ambani (Mumbai Indians owner) and Bumrah that it was important for Bumrah to miss the IPL for the England series, or play a lesser number of matches in the IPL. I’m sure that they would have agreed to do so. How Jasprit Bumrah is preparing for Lord's Test - batting, bowling and lot of jokes!“Who remembers the runs and wickets taken in the IPL? However, people will remember Mohammed Siraj's lion-hearted performance in this series (23 wickets in five Tests), Shubman Gill (754 runs in five Tests), KL Rahul (532), Yashasvi Jaiswal (411 runs) and Rishabh Pant's (479) sublime batting, and Washington Sundar's superb all-round performance (284 runs & seven wickets in four Tests). A series like this one takes place probably once in four years. I believe India are not playing a five-Test series till Jan 2027 (against Australia). It was a series for the ages and I wish Bumrah was available for almost all the Tests. We could have won the series if that was the case," Vengsarkar told TOI on Sunday.Returning from a back injury which forced him to miss the 2025 Champions Trophy in UAE, Bumrah played in 12 matches in IPL-2025 for MI, bowling 47.2 overs in which he took 18 wickets. The 31-year-old took 14 wickets in three Tests@26.00 in the Tendulkar-Anderson Trophy, and was under-fire for missing the crucial third and fifth Tests of the series due to workload management.However, Vengsarkar doesn't agree with Bumrah's critics who feel that he shouldn't miss Tests because of workload management issues. "You can’t blame Bumrah for missing matches at times. We must remember that Bumrah has undergone a back surgery. His back is vulnerable and we must be cautious with him. You can’t question his commitment for the country. He has given his all whenever he has played for India. I hope he returns for India after adequate rest and when fully fit," he felt. ‘Would have asked Kohli to play in England series before quitting Tests’Vengsarkar felt that in his own opinion, former India captain Virat Kohli, who quit Tests just before the England tour, should have been asked to take retirement after playing in the recently-held series. "If I was the India chief selector, I would have persuaded Virat to bid goodbye to Test cricket after playing the England series. We needed his class and experience in this series," the 116-Test veteran, who was India's chief selector from 2006-08, said.‘Gambhir wasn't out of line with curator’Vengsarkar opined that India's head coach Gautam Gambhir wasn't out of line with the Oval pitch curator Lee Fortis during their clash ahead of the fifth Test. Disagreeing with former Australia opener Matthew Hayden's recent remark on the controversy that Gambhir could have "used better language and toned it down." Vengsarkar, defending Gambhir, said, "As the head coach of the Indian team, Gambhir had every right to see the pitch from close quarters. When teams tour India, their entire team-and not just the coach and captain, examine the pitch minutely. Even their media inspects the pitch before the match. No one tells them anything. So, how are the rules different when we are playing in England? “Would Hayden, or any of the Aussie cricketers, take it well if a curator had asked them to stay away from the square ahead of an important match. If this had happened to the Aussies, they would have used the choices of words to show the curator his place."'England series showed good pitches can produce thrilling Test cricket’Meanwhile, Vengsarkar was all praise for the England & Wales Cricket Board for staging a thrilling series, which seems to have infused excitement back in Test cricket for a while "I must appreciate the culture of Test cricket in England. There were huge crowds for all the Tests, and the sporting wickets ensured that the result of all the five Tests was decided on the fifth and final day. This series, which will be remembered for ages, has revived the interest for Test cricket in cricket lovers. It has increased Test cricket’s importance. This shows that if you dish out good pitches, Test cricket can not just survive, but flourish too,” the 69-year-old praised.He advised the BCCI to take a cue from the ECB and prepare sporting tracks for the home Tests in the 2025-26 season. “I hope that India do the same in their upcoming international season (two Tests each against West Indies and South Africa) and provide good, sporting wickets for Tests. The BCCI must not pander to the wishes of short-sightedness of captains and coaches, who are just looking for short-term gains by winning matches and qualifying for the World Test Championship final," Vengsarkar asserted.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

SUBSCRIBE NOW!"IPL offer hua tha us waqt, liya nahi (The IPL offer was made earlier, but I didn’t accept it at that time). "Aisa nahi hai ki pachta rahe hain hum. Khush hi hain hum" (It is not like I have any regrets, I am happy).Several Bollywood stars are heavily invested in the IPL. Shah Rukh Khan and Juhi Chawla own the three-time champions Kolkata Knight Riders, while Preity Zinta is one of the co-owners of the IPL 2025 finalists, Punjab Kings.Salman’s upcoming movie, Battle of Galwan, based on the 2020 India-China Galwan Valley conflict, is one of his most physically challenging roles to date.The film, directed by Apoorva Lakhia of Shootout at Lokhandwala fame, will feature Khan in intense action sequences and challenging shooting conditions in Ladakh."It is physically demanding. Every year, every month, every day it gets more and more difficult. I have to give more time now (for training). Earlier, I would do it (train) in one or two weeks; now I’m running, kicking, punching, and all that stuff. This film demands that," Khan told PTI.PollWould you like to see Salman Khan buy an IPL team in the future?Yes, definitely!No, I prefer him as an actor.Only if he can handle it.I have mixed feelings.The 59-year-old actor elaborated on the film’s challenging shooting schedule and locations."When I was signing the film, I thought it’s amazing, but it’s a very, very difficult film to do. I have 20 days (of work) in Ladakh and then seven to eight days (of shooting) in cold water. We will be shooting this month," Khan shared.The actor also confirmed that, unlike his traditional Eid releases, Battle of Galwan will hit theaters in January.In other developments, Khan announced that a sequel to his 2015 film Bajrangi Bhaijaan is also in progress.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

SUBSCRIBE NOW!Babar was left visibly stunned, gesturing in disbelief at the brilliance of the delivery. While it was indeed a fine ball, his shot selection raised questions — attempting a flick with only the half-face of the bat against a moving delivery proved costly, as it shattered his stumps. His dismissal deepened Pakistan’s woes, with the team reeling at 139/6 in 33.5 overs at the time of writing.Babar walked in at 37/1 after Pakistan lost Saim Ayub in the ninth over, having opted to bat first. Seales, already in rhythm after dismissing Ayub, delivered two dot balls to start. His third delivery was fuller, seaming away just enough to beat Babar’s flick. Off-balance, Babar missed completely, and the ball snuck between bat and pad to crash into the stumps.The dismissal added to Babar’s ongoing struggles in ODIs this year, where he is averaging just over 30 at a sluggish strike rate of 80. His poor form has already cost him a place in Pakistan’s T20I squad, having been dropped due to slow scoring.PollWhat do you think about Babar Azam's performance in the second ODI against West Indies?He needs to improve his shot selectionHe should be dropped from the teamHe will bounce back in the next matchIt's just a phase, every player goes through itRoston Chase and Justin Greaves led the West Indies to a five-wicket victory over Pakistan with 10 balls to spare in the rain-reduced second one-day international on Sunday, leveling the three-match series at 1-1.Chase’s 49 not out off 47 balls included two sixes and the winning boundary as the West Indies scored 184-5 in 33.2 overs.The hosts were chasing a revised target of 181 in 35 overs under the DLS method after multiple rain interruptions saw Pakistan’s innings end at 171-7 in 37 overs.

While both remain comfortable in the format, their recent inactivity raises questions. Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma (IANS Photo) Two of India’s greatest white-ball players, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, could be playing their last ODI series Down Under in October as BCCI looks to plan for 2027 World Cup in South Africa, Zimbabwe & NamibiaCHENNAI: Virat Kohli fans across the world breathed a sigh of relief when the ODI master posted a picture of himself on social media taking throwdowns in the nets in London. Around the same time, Rohit Sharma was also pictured returning to India, probably with the intent of preparing for a season of cricket ahead.Greenstone Lobo predicts Virat Kohli & Rohit Sharma's ODI futureGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Over the last couple of months, as the new Team India, under Shubman Gill, went from strength to strength, snatching a famous 2-2 draw in the Test series in England, a narrative started gaining traction. Is this the end of Kohli and Rohit? Should Gill be made the captain of the ODI team as well? Questions were being asked in different forums.PollShould Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli retire from ODIs after the series in Australia?Yes, it's time for them to step down.No, they should continue for the World Cup.Only if they are not performing well.The fact that neither Rohit nor Virat, who announced their T20 retirements in 2024 and hung up their boots in Test cricket earlier this year, were playing any cricket of late added fuel to the speculations. But for now, it seems Rohit and Virat may give it a final shot to the format that they made absolutely their own in the last decade and a half.While power hitters have taken over T20s and the extreme interrogation of red-ball cricket seems to be taking a toll on these two giants, they are still comfortable playing ODIs. In the Champions Trophy earlier this year, which India won, Kohli scored 218 runs from five games while Rohit managed a respectable 180. There was some talk that the duo might call it quits after that, but no announcement was forthcoming.The next ODI World Cup is in South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Namibia in OctNov 2027, and it is still more than two years away. India, starting from Oct this year, have 27 scheduled ODIs before the World Cup, in addition to the Asia Cup in 2027, which is in the 50-over format. It is a long way off, and there’s some speculation about the BCCI giving Rohit and Virat a farewell three-match series in Australia in Oct.Former India captain and BCCI president Sourav Ganguly played it safe in a programme in Kolkata when asked about it. “I am not aware of it… Whoever does well will play. If they do well, they should continue. Kohli’s One-day record is phenomenal, even Rohit’s. Both are phenomenal in white-ball cricket,” he stressed.The big problem, though, is that both Rohit and Virat haven’t played much cricket since the Champions Trophy, and the game tends to move very fast. Middlesex and Surrey, two London-based sides, apparently showed interest in signing Virat up for the Royal London One Day Cup, but the deal didn’t go through.If Virat and Rohit want to extend their ODI careers beyond Oct, they may have to play domestic One-day tournaments like the Vijay Hazare Trophy in Dec and before that the A series against both Australia and South Africa, in addition to international cricket. At this stage of their careers, there seems to be a bit of a question mark over whether these two legends will be keen to go through the rigours of domestic One-day cricket all over again in obscure centres.Former India opener and national selector Devang Gandhi has a clear take on the issue. He feels that the younger crop has proved beyond doubt that they are ready for every challenge in the recently-concluded Test series. “How will you make players like Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rishabh Pant, Sai Sudharshan, among others, sit out when they have shown how well they can adapt? The bigger transition is from T20s to Tests. Once a player has done well in Test cricket and has the power game, ODIs should come easier to them. It is very important that the selectors and the team management sit together and take a call,” Gandhi told TOI.According to him, game-time is absolutely vital, and the selectors should take an honest call on whether they are convinced that Virat and Rohit will be at the top of their games in two years’ time. “If, say, in a year’s time, we come to a situation where one of them is not firing and we need a replacement, the team management may not have enough time to prepare a player for the job,” Gandhi said.The captaincy issue, too, is vital, and the selectors need to take a call. Gill, quite clearly, has shown he is ready for the job in Tests. Meanwhile, on current form, Gill is arguably India’s best batsman in the ODI format, with an average of 59.04 and a strike rate of 99.56. With his performances, he commands the respect of the team, and ODI captaincy should come easy to him.“There’s absolutely no doubt about the contribution of Rohit and Virat. But time doesn’t wait for anybody,” Gandhi stressed. Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

I have time to decide. I have some time until December, so I'll take another couple of months, and then finally, I can make my decision,” Dhoni told the host.From the crowd, a fan passionately urged, “You have to play, sir.” Dhoni, known for his sharp wit, instantly drew laughter with his response: “Arre, ghutne me jo dard hota hai uska take care kaun karega? (The pain I have in my knees, who will take care of that?)”The video of the interaction has since went viral on social media, WATCH:Dhoni's knee has been a talking point for the past few seasons. Right after leading CSK to a dramatic title in IPL 2023 by defeating Gujarat Titans, he underwent surgery in Mumbai. The veteran wicketkeeper-batter had played that season through discomfort, delaying the operation until after the campaign to allow a proper rehabilitation period before IPL 2024.In the last two editions, Dhoni has batted lower down the order, largely to manage his knee issue.Whether he dons the yellow jersey again in 2026 remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: with every witty one-liner, Dhoni is keeping fans guessing — and the conversation alive.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Both India and Afghanistan have won 12 T20Is in a row.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

Previously, Pakistan and New Zealand had each managed nine wins on the trot, while England’s best run in the format stands at eight straight matches.Meanwhile, David's aggressive knock came off 52 balls and proved crucial after Australia lost five key batsmen within the first seven overs. His powerful hitting included several sixes that landed on the stadium roof.PollDo you believe Australia's T20 team can extend their winning streak to 12 matches?YesNoThe match also saw 19-year-old Kwena Maphaka become the youngest bowler among full ICC member countries to claim a four-wicket haul, finishing with figures of 4-20. However, his achievement was overshadowed by David's remarkable batting display.Australian captain Mitchell Marsh began the three-match series with a six off the first ball from Lungi Ngidi. The hosts then faced a collapse as Kagiso Rabada claimed both openers, and Maphaka made further inroads into the middle order.Travis Head departed for just 2 runs after being caught by Maphaka at short third man. Marsh followed soon after when Maphaka took a well-judged running catch at square leg.Cameron Green contributed a quickfire 35 off 13 balls before being caught by wicketkeeper Rickelton. Josh Inglis fell to George Linde's first delivery, failing to clear the point fielder.David’s innings received a lifeline when Tristan Stubbs dropped a straightforward catch in the outfield after the batsman had reached his fifty. He went on to form a 59-run partnership with Ben Dwarshuis, who scored 17.South Africa's chase began poorly, losing three wickets during the powerplay and slumping to 48-3. Captain Aiden Markram, back after resting during the Zimbabwe triangular series, briefly showed promise before being caught in the covers.Rickelton and Stubbs revived South Africa's hopes with a 72-run partnership. However, Josh Hazlewood's double strike in the 15th over shifted the momentum back to Australia.The visitors lost four wickets for just three runs as their chase faltered. Adam Zampa, despite struggling with a wet ball earlier, finished with figures of 2-33, dismissing Corbin Bosch and Senuran Muthusamy off the final two balls of his spell.Hazlewood ended with impressive figures of 3-27, while Dwarshuis matched him with 3-26. The victory extended Australia's winning streak in T20 internationals to nine matches.The match concluded dramatically when Nathan Ellis was run out off the final ball, marking the first time South Africa had bowled out Australia in a T20 match. Glenn Maxwell's spectacular catch to dismiss Rickelton in the final over sealed the home team's victory.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Balancing studies, chess, and play, she dreams of becoming India’s youngest IM and GM. Aarini Lahoty becomes FIDE-rated chess player at the age of 5 (Special Arrangements)  NEW DELHI: In late 2020, Magnus Carlsen, then still a four-time World Chess Champion, was set to lock horns against challenger Ian Nepomniachtchi. However, the much-anticipated clash was postponed due to the COVID-19.A year later, when the Norwegian finally faced the Russian in an over-the-board battle in Dubai, nearly 2,200 km away, in a Lajpat Nagar household in New Delhi, a two-year-old toddler named Aarini Lahoty was glued to the television. While she had little idea of what was at stake, her keen eyes followed the moving pieces on the board. She was determined to name them correctly whenever her father, Surendar Lahoty, a chess player himself, pointed at the TV screen.Pawn, knight, king — she knew them all.Exclusive Interview: How Aarini Lahoty, 5, Leads India's Youngest Chess TalentsGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Fast forward to August 2025: Aarini Lahoty has become her school’s princess, Delhi’s newest chess gem, and India’s highest-rated player in her age group, across boys and girls, among those born after 2019.A FIDE rating of 1551, as of August 11, 2025, puts the five-year-old far ahead of her peers of the same age or younger.As a result, father Surendar, now a sports coach at Bluebells School International, where Aarini also studies, has been grinning, nodding and all but drowning in a flood of congratulatory greetings.‘Because I get to move first’Ask Aarini to introduce herself, and she answers without hesitation: “Aarini Lahoty. From Delhi, New Delhi.” Does she like playing chess? “Yes.” Which side? “White… because I get to make the first move.”She knows she became the youngest female FIDE-rated player in India. “Yes,” she says with a wry smile when asked if she’s feeling good about it. The attention from well-wishers? “Yes.” Her favourite chess player? “My dad.” Not Carlsen, not reigning World Chess Champion D Gukesh, not India's cureent No. 1 R Praggnanandhaa, just her father.Aarini Lahoty (Special Arrangements) She did enjoy watching Divya Deshmukh win the FIDE Women’s World Cup recently, and she wants to be like her. “Yes,” she nods firmly.She insists she loves both studying and chess equally. Her favourite subject is EVS.Does she get nervous facing older, stronger players? “No… I just keep playing. Sometimes I make blunders,” she tells TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interaction.A proud coach-father“That feeling was truly amazing — as a parent and as her coach. Our child has come forward and broken the record. The pride is for everyone — school, family, everywhere,” Surendar admits.The 33-year-old, originally from Rajasthan but raised in Assam, has been a competitive player himself, earning a FIDE rating in his very first nationals.Today, he runs the IGSF Chess Academy in Delhi and coaches at her daughter's school.He says Aarini’s chess journey began almost as soon as she could walk. “From the age of one, she would set up the board herself. During lockdown, she watched me teach online and began moving pieces correctly. She’s truly adventurous, her name even means that.”Aarini Lahoty plays chess with her father (Special Arrangements)From the outset, he ensured she played in open categories. “She has competed in Under-7, Under-9, and Under-11, not just her age group. Losing is fine; what matters is learning. That’s what I was taught by my father late Vijay Lahoty, and I passed it on to her.”A day in the life of a 5-year-old champAt home, Aarini’s day is as structured as her chessboard. “After school, she rests for an hour-and-a-half, then plays outside. Her mother takes care of her studies, I focus on her chess. She loves puzzles so much she often sends me photos saying, ‘Please answer this right now’ if she’s stuck,” says Surendar.The family ensures there is no unhealthy pressure.“We keep it balanced: studies, chess, swimming. The school is very supportive and gives her the freedom to focus on her dreams,” he adds.The road aheadWith Indian chess in a golden era, D Gukesh as World Champion, and stars like Humpy, Harika, Praggnanandhaa and Divya inspiring new players, Aarini represents the very youngest wave of this boom.ALSO READ: The Mother's Gambit: How a housewife's trick to make dinner prepped a record-breaking 8-year-old in PunjabHer father’s vision is clear: “We want her to become the youngest IM and GM of India, and make everyone proud.”But for now, Aarini continues to juggle school, play, and chess with a calm confidence that belies her age.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Sports Minister Mandaviya hailed the governance bill as the most significant reform since independence, aiming for accountability and transparency in sports federations. The anti-doping bill addresses WADA's concerns, ensuring NADA's independence. Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya The long-awaited National Sports Governance Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha here on Monday with Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya describing it as the "single biggest reform in Indian sports since independence" amid opposition protests over revision of electoral rolls in Bihar.The National Anti-Doping (Amendment) Bill was also passed when the Lok Sabha reassembled at 2pm after an early adjournment due to opposition protests.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"It is the single biggest reform in sports since independence. This bill will ensure accountability, ensure justice, best governance in sports federations," Mandaviya said amid sloganeering by opposition members."It will have massive significance in India's sports ecosystem. It is unfortunate that such an important bill and reform does not have opposition's participation," he added.The opposition leaders were not present in the house when the bills were introduced for consideration and passage as most of them were detained while marching towards the Election Commission headquarters against the Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls in Bihar and alleged voter data fudging.But after two MPs participated in the consideration debate, speaking in the bill's support, the opposition members returned to the house and started raising slogans.Amid the din, the bills were passed by a voice vote following which the House was adjourned till 4pm.Earlier, Chairman of the parliamentary committee on sports, Digvijaya Singh, requested Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to refer the National Sports Governance Bill to the panel. He felt that the bill should be examined and discussed before it is taken up by ParliamentMandaviya said the two bills were key reforms aimed at building a "transparent, accountable and world-class sports ecosystem" in India as the country aims to bid for the 2036 Olympics."Efforts have been made since 1975 and in 1985, we had the first draft. But sports was also politicised for personal gains. Some ministers made efforts to bring this bill but could not move forward."In 2011, we had a National Sports Code. Another effort was made to turn it into a bill. It reached the cabinet, there was a discussion as well but the bill was deferred after that. It did not reach the Parliament," the minister stated while presenting a timeline of the bill's journey."The National Sports Bill Governance Bill is a force of change...Despite being such a large country, our performance at the Olympic Games and on the international stage has not been satisfactory and this Bill aims to build India's sports capacity," he added.The sports governance bill has provisions for a National Sports Board (NSB) to create a stringent system of accountability. All National Sports Federations (NSFs) will have to attain NSB's recognition for access to central government funding.The NSB will have the mandate to de-recognise a national body that fails to hold elections for its Executive Committee or has committed "gross irregularities in the election procedures."Failure to publish annual audited accounts or "misused, misapplied or misappropriated public funds" would also be liable for action by the NSB but it would be required to consult the concerned global body before making its move.Another feature is the proposal for a National Sports Tribunal, which will have the powers of a civil court and decide disputes ranging from selection to election involving federations and athletes. Once instituted, Tribunal's decisions can only be challenged in the Supreme Court.The bill makes some concessions on the issue of age cap for administrators by allowing those in the bracket of 70 to 75 to contest elections if the concerned international bodies' statutes and bylaws allow for it. It is a departure from the national sports code that capped the age limit at 70."...as a part of the preparatory activities for the bidding of Summer Olympic Games 2036, it is imperative that the sports governance landscape undergo a positive transformation to bring better outcomes, sporting excellence and aids in improved performance in major international competitions," read the bill's statement of objectives.All recognised national sports bodies would also come under the ambit of the Right to Information (RTI) Act, something that the BCCI has vehemently opposed since it is not dependent on government funding.However, the cricket board has got some leeway on that front with the government amending the bill to ensure that RTI would be applicable only on bodies that rely on government funding or support.The National Anti-Doping (Amendment) Bill-2025 that seeks to incorporate the changes sought by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), which objected to "government interference" in the functioning of the country's Anti-Doping Agency (NADA).The act was originally passed in 2022 but its implementation had to be put on hold due to objections raised by WADA.The world body objected to the institution of a National Board for Anti-Doping in Sports, which was empowered to make recommendations to the government on anti-doping regulations.The Board, which was to comprise a chairperson and two members appointed by the central government, was also authorised to oversee the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) and even issue directions to it.WADA rejected this provision as government interference in an autonomous body. In the amended bill, the Board has been retained but without the powers to oversee NADA or the advisory role it was previously assigned. The amended bill asserts NADA's "operational independence".

Virat Kohli (AP Photo) NEW DELHI: Speculation over the ODI futures of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma has intensified, but the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) appears in no hurry to make a decisive call on the two icons.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!With the August home series against Bangladesh called off, India’s next ODI assignment will be an away series against Australia from October 19–25. Whether Kohli and Rohit will feature in ODIs beyond that tour remains uncertain.Virat Kohli on why did he retire from Test cricket: 'It's time when you...'According to reports, one proposal being discussed in BCCI circles is for the duo to tune up for Australia by featuring in a couple of India A matches against Australia A in Kanpur (September 30, October 3, October 5), coinciding with the senior team’s first Test against the West Indies in Ahmedabad.An intriguing question — if they need List A match practice — is when Kohli last played such a game outside of ODIs. The answer takes us back 12 years, to the NKP Salve Challenger Trophy in Indore in 2013. Then Delhi skipper Kohli turned out for his state side in a clash against India Blue, which also featured current head coach Gautam Gambhir as opening batter and sharing the XI with Virender Sehwag and Ashish Nehra. Delhi fell short by 50 runs chasing 275, with Kohli scoring 23 off 28 balls, striking five fours, in the final.That Challenger Trophy ended with Delhi losing the final to India Blue, captained by Yuvraj Singh, with Bhuvneshwar Kumar taking 4 for 39 to seal the Man of the Match award. Kohli was run out in the 10th over of the run chase. Kohli is now the only active player from that Delhi team.Both Kohli, now based in London, and Rohit have been on extended breaks since the IPL. While Kohli has posted videos of indoor net sessions, Rohit recently returned to Mumbai and is expected to resume training shortly. Whether they walk out in blue again after October could hinge on decisions made in the coming weeks.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Azharuddin made the remarks at the launch of Kirmani’s autobiography ‘Stumped: Life Behind and Beyond The Twenty-Two Yards’."He is the number one wicket-keeper in the world. Such a wicket-keeper was never born. It was not easy for him to do wicketkeeping with four spinners. He took many good catches in the World Cup in 1983. Even in the match when Kapil scored 175 runs, he scored crucial 24 runs. I am very happy to attend this event today. May god give him a long life. People should also read this book and enjoy, and I hope it is successful," Azharuddin said.MS Dhoni returns as CSK Captain, confirms coach Stephen FlemingGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

I hope he continues to grow and perform well," Azharuddin said.Siraj finished as the leading wicket-taker in the five-match Test series, with 23 wickets, and bowled the most overs (185.3) among all players.

SUBSCRIBE NOW!Speaking at the trophy unveiling ceremony in the presence of former India all-rounder Yuvraj Singh and her teammates, Harmanpreet admitted that the drought weighs on the players but also fuels their motivation."We want to break that barrier which all Indians are waiting for. World Cups are always special, always want to do special for my country. Whenever I see Yuvi bhaiya (Yuvraj Singh), it gives me a lot of motivation," she said.PollDo you believe India will win their first ICC women's title in the upcoming World Cup?Yes, absolutely!No, they will fall short.India have reached the final on multiple occasions — most memorably in 2017 when they finished runners-up in England — but are yet to clinch the elusive crown. The World Cup begins September 30, preceded by a crucial home ODI series against defending champions and tournament favourites Australia from September 14."Playing against Australia is always challenging and we get to know what is our standing. The series will give us a lot of confidence. We have been putting a lot of effort in our training camps and the results are showing," Harmanpreet noted.With the trophy now touring India and the team buoyed by recent wins in England, Harmanpreet believes this World Cup could finally end India’s wait for global glory.“There is a larger picture here which has to do with what this means to the country. The growth of women’s cricket in many ways is a reflection of the country’s progress,” said ICC CEO Sanjog Gupta. “It normalises women occupying spaces which were traditionally occupied by men. It normalises women being outdoors. It also creates an opportunity for both men and women to come out and support Team India, not just the men in blue but the women in blue.”Gupta continued, “In every sense, the growth of women’s cricket over the last eight years has brought up to this moment where it is time for women’s cricket to take the next leap. This World Cup can be the springboard for that next leap.” "World Cups are more than just events, they are apertures for building trans-generational legacies and foster new cultures."Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

SUBSCRIBE NOW!In the 12th over of Australia’s innings against South Africa, Tim David hammered a flat six into the crowd, where Gill pulled off a one-handed stunner with his left hand while holding both drinks in his right — without spilling a drop.“The lemonade ones are bloody good. I’ve got a bit of a hangover this morning,” Gill was quoted as saying by The Age.“It just stuck. My hand is a bit sore this morning but, yeah, happy with it. My phone is blowing up,” said the 26-year-old pilot from Darwin.Gill’s grab has been compared to the famous crowd catch taken by Channel Nine cameraman Tony Fox in 1987, when Ian Botham launched Simon O’Donnell down the ground for six.Fox took it with both hands — cigarette in mouth.Gill admitted his dad had sent him the clip, but he isn’t putting himself in the same league.PollWas Harry Gill's catch more impressive than the famous catch by Tony Fox in 1987?Yes, definitely!No, Tony Fox's catch was iconic.Both were amazing in their own right.“His is so much cooler, bro,” Gill said. “I wish I had a durry [cigarette] in my mouth so I could have done that.“The South African cricketer in front of me said it was a pretty good catch.”Former Australian cricketer and Fox commentator Mark Waugh, referring to the 1987 effort, said of Gill’s catch: “You just need a smoke and you’d be right at home.”Tim David bludgeoned eight sixes in his robust 83 to lead Australia to a 17-run win over South Africa in the first T20 on Sunday, as international cricket returned to Darwin after 17 years.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

'They will lose to India’: Ex-cricketer doubts Aus & SA’s WTC final chances
Aakash Chopra suggested that both Australia and South Africa, the finalists of the previous WTC cycle, might face difficulties in reaching the 2027 final. Despite Australia's strong start, their tour of India and an aging bowling attack could hinder their progress. South Africa's challenging away series in the subcontinent also diminish their chances of qualifying, according to Chopra.

SUBSCRIBE NOW!Speaking on his YouTube channel, Chopra, who was analysing the newly drawn fixtures, said that despite Australia’s dominant start to the 2025–27 WTC cycle, their path will be far from straightforward. Australia currently top the table with 100 percentage points after a 3-0 away sweep against West Indies.Bold prediction! Astrologer Greenstone Lobo picks winner of Australia vs South Africa WTC Final 2025“Their home series are against New Zealand, England and Bangladesh. They will 100 percent win against Bangladesh. They should win against New Zealand. They should win against England as well. However, it’s a five-match series, so they are unlikely to get full points,” Chopra said.PollWhich team is more likely to struggle in the next WTC cycle?AustraliaSouth AfricaBoth teams equallyPointing to the India tour as a potential stumbling block, he added: “I feel they will leave India after losing to them. They might win just one match. If they win only one match, they will lose a lot of points. South Africa will challenge them again. So it is not that straightforward. Decent chance, but I won’t say strong contenders.”Current WTC Point TableChopra also flagged Australia’s ageing bowling attack, warning of an imminent transition period that could impact results.The former opener was equally sceptical about defending champions South Africa’s prospects, noting their challenging schedule. “Australia, England and Bangladesh are South Africa’s home series. Australia and England are tough, and they will beat Bangladesh. The away series are against India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. South Africa have less chances. All three of their away series are in the subcontinent. They will find it difficult to even draw all three of those series,” he said.“South Africa, in my opinion, might not qualify. There is a good chance of them not qualifying,” Chopra concluded.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Gill has already proven himself ready to lead in Tests and, given his current form, is arguably India’s best ODI batsman, averaging 59.04 with a strike rate of 99.56. His performances have earned him the team’s respect, making the ODI captaincy a natural fit.PollShould Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli continue playing ODIs?Yes, they should continueNo, it's time for younger playersOnly if they perform wellUndecided“There’s absolutely no doubt about the contribution of Rohit and Virat. But time doesn’t wait for anybody,” Gandhi added.With Rohit and Virat — who retired from T20Is in 2024 and stepped away from Test cricket earlier this year — the speculation about their ODI future has been rife. For now, though, it appears they may give one final push to the format they dominated for over 15 years.If they wish to extend their ODI careers beyond October, both may need to feature in domestic one-day competitions like the Vijay Hazare Trophy in December, as well as the ‘A’ series against Australia and South Africa, in addition to international fixtures.At this stage of their careers, however, there remains uncertainty over whether these legends would be willing to endure the grind of domestic one-day cricket in far-flung venues once again.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Akash Deep also praised Mohammed Siraj's fitness and mental fortitude during the series. Akash Deep of India celebrates after dismissing Ben Duckett of England. LUCKNOW: India pacer Akash Deep has been spending quality time with his family after a fruitful tour of England. On Saturday, he also paid a visit to Lucknow to meet his sisters on the occasion of Rakshabandhan. Despite his busy schedule, Akash Deep took time out to talk to TOI on his experiences of the long English tour.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Opening up on the controversy involving Ben Duckett during the Oval Test, Akash Deep revealed that he told Duckett that he won't be the only one to hit and he would hit too. Akash Deep gave a sendoff to the England opener by putting his hand around his shoulder and uttering a few words to him after dismissing him. The images went viral.Akash Deep press conference: On replacing Jasprit Bumrah, message from Gautam Gambhir and more"On a cricket field, you need to keep a cool head. I told Duckett, 'You won't be the only one hitting; I'll hit too. Sometimes you miss, and I hit'."Akash Deep said that Duckett had told him that he would not be able to dismiss him and whatever he said to Duckett was in response. “It was quite a good experience. Every pace bowler wants to play in England. Although the wickets were not as we had expected, we still put our heart and soul into every match to end the hard-fought series on even terms. The series was a great learning for me.”PollShould more cricketers dedicate their performances to loved ones facing challenges?Absolutely, it inspires others.It depends on personal preference."Taking ten wickets individually in a match (at Edgbaston, which India won) is quite significant but scoring a half century for the team was more important to me. While I was working on my half-century, the only thing on my mind was not to get out and to keep playing," he added.Asked about dedicating his 10-wicket match haul in the second Test at Birmingham to his elder sister who is suffering from cancer, he said, "My message was not just for my sister; it was for the entire country and the world, emphasizing the importance of standing by loved ones during difficult times."On the final day of the last Test at the Oval, Akash Deep remembers, "I woke up early due to excitement, knowing we needed four wickets, and England wanted just 35 runs, and that only we three pacers had to do it. But we believed in ourselves, and the England batters apparently panicked. We didn't know the ball would start swinging in the morning, but once it did, we realized the wickets would fall quickly, and that's what happened."On his partner in attack, Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep said, "As a fast bowler, he is fit, and the way he puts in effort behind the ball sets him apart. Playing five consecutive matches is commendable. From this, one learns that being mentally fit is more important than being physically fit."Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

While both remain comfortable in the format, their recent inactivity raises questions. Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma (IANS Photo) Two of India’s greatest white-ball players, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, could be playing their last ODI series Down Under in October as BCCI looks to plan for 2027 World Cup in South Africa, Zimbabwe & NamibiaCHENNAI: Virat Kohli fans across the world breathed a sigh of relief when the ODI master posted a picture of himself on social media taking throwdowns in the nets in London. Around the same time, Rohit Sharma was also pictured returning to India, probably with the intent of preparing for a season of cricket ahead.Greenstone Lobo predicts Virat Kohli & Rohit Sharma's ODI futureGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Over the last couple of months, as the new Team India, under Shubman Gill, went from strength to strength, snatching a famous 2-2 draw in the Test series in England, a narrative started gaining traction. Is this the end of Kohli and Rohit? Should Gill be made the captain of the ODI team as well? Questions were being asked in different forums.PollShould Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli retire from ODIs after the series in Australia?Yes, it's time for them to step down.No, they should continue for the World Cup.Only if they are not performing well.The fact that neither Rohit nor Virat, who announced their T20 retirements in 2024 and hung up their boots in Test cricket earlier this year, were playing any cricket of late added fuel to the speculations. But for now, it seems Rohit and Virat may give it a final shot to the format that they made absolutely their own in the last decade and a half.While power hitters have taken over T20s and the extreme interrogation of red-ball cricket seems to be taking a toll on these two giants, they are still comfortable playing ODIs. In the Champions Trophy earlier this year, which India won, Kohli scored 218 runs from five games while Rohit managed a respectable 180. There was some talk that the duo might call it quits after that, but no announcement was forthcoming.The next ODI World Cup is in South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Namibia in OctNov 2027, and it is still more than two years away. India, starting from Oct this year, have 27 scheduled ODIs before the World Cup, in addition to the Asia Cup in 2027, which is in the 50-over format. It is a long way off, and there’s some speculation about the BCCI giving Rohit and Virat a farewell three-match series in Australia in Oct.Former India captain and BCCI president Sourav Ganguly played it safe in a programme in Kolkata when asked about it. “I am not aware of it… Whoever does well will play. If they do well, they should continue. Kohli’s One-day record is phenomenal, even Rohit’s. Both are phenomenal in white-ball cricket,” he stressed.The big problem, though, is that both Rohit and Virat haven’t played much cricket since the Champions Trophy, and the game tends to move very fast. Middlesex and Surrey, two London-based sides, apparently showed interest in signing Virat up for the Royal London One Day Cup, but the deal didn’t go through.If Virat and Rohit want to extend their ODI careers beyond Oct, they may have to play domestic One-day tournaments like the Vijay Hazare Trophy in Dec and before that the A series against both Australia and South Africa, in addition to international cricket. At this stage of their careers, there seems to be a bit of a question mark over whether these two legends will be keen to go through the rigours of domestic One-day cricket all over again in obscure centres.Former India opener and national selector Devang Gandhi has a clear take on the issue. He feels that the younger crop has proved beyond doubt that they are ready for every challenge in the recently-concluded Test series. “How will you make players like Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rishabh Pant, Sai Sudharshan, among others, sit out when they have shown how well they can adapt? The bigger transition is from T20s to Tests. Once a player has done well in Test cricket and has the power game, ODIs should come easier to them. It is very important that the selectors and the team management sit together and take a call,” Gandhi told TOI.According to him, game-time is absolutely vital, and the selectors should take an honest call on whether they are convinced that Virat and Rohit will be at the top of their games in two years’ time. “If, say, in a year’s time, we come to a situation where one of them is not firing and we need a replacement, the team management may not have enough time to prepare a player for the job,” Gandhi said.The captaincy issue, too, is vital, and the selectors need to take a call. Gill, quite clearly, has shown he is ready for the job in Tests. Meanwhile, on current form, Gill is arguably India’s best batsman in the ODI format, with an average of 59.04 and a strike rate of 99.56. With his performances, he commands the respect of the team, and ODI captaincy should come easy to him.“There’s absolutely no doubt about the contribution of Rohit and Virat. But time doesn’t wait for anybody,” Gandhi stressed. Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

File Pic: India's Shubman Gill, Arshdeep Singh, and Hardik Pandya. (PTI Photo) CHENNAI: Shubman Gill marshalled his troops admirably in his maiden Test series as India captain, eventually pulling off a 2-2 draw against hosts England. Gill earned praise from former New Zealand all-rounder Craig McMillan, who stressed that the new skipper should create a “style of play” which the team sticks to during his captaincy tenure. Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!During an interaction in Chennai, McMillan – the assistant coach of the NZ women’s side that is training at the Super Kings Academy as part of their preparation for the 50-over World Cup — also spoke about India missing a Hardik Pandya-type player in Tests, England’s ‘Bazball’ and more. Excerpts:India vs England, 5th Test Day 3: Why Shubman Gill holds key, Jazball vs Bazball!Gill’s captaincy skills were tested in England. What do you make of his leadership?He looks a good captain. The first series is very tough. In such a pressure-cooked series, he probably made a few mistakes. But you expect those in his first series. He will get better with experience. He is the future, so India will invest in him. He will get to know his team’s game, which I think is really important, and the style of play.How do India want to play under Gill?When India had played under Virat Kohli, everyone knew how they had played — they had been aggressive. It might be a bit different because of the personality of Gill. He has got to work that out with the coach Gautam Gambhir.Washington Sundar, Ravindra Jadeja and Ben Stokes had huge roles to play. How vital is it to have genuine allrounders in Tests?In Asian conditions, you need a spin-bowling allrounder like Jadeja, Washington or previously R Ashwin. In NZ, Australia and England, you need a fast-bowling allrounder. It is where India are missing a player like Hardik Pandya who can bowl medium pace and bat lower down the order. For England, Ben Stokes is two players in one.England head coach Brendon McCullum is a former teammate of yours. What are your thoughts on his coaching philosophy?Brendon has always been an aggressive operator. He is a real positive man as well. It is no surprise that he has pushed that philosophy with England – being proactive and pushing the game forward. And England have certainly played better under him than they did under the previous regime. It has made for entertaining cricket at timesCan ‘Bazball’ be effective in all conditions?I do not think that you can play one style all over the world. If England are smart enough (during the Ashes), they will adapt because Australia have got a quality bowling attack. If you make mistakes in Australia, you get sorted out pretty quickly.Should there be a two-tier model for Test cricket?I do not think that it will be good for the world game. The ‘Big Three’ (India, Australia and England) need to support the other teams. Some countries do not have the resources that they have. It would be a bit of a mistake if it is split into two.Coming to the Women’s World Cup, how has NZ’s preparation been?The World Cup is not that far away, so to come to India and expose some of our girls to what we are likely to face, is hugely beneficial. The time we have had at the academy has been outstanding. It is a beneficial trip, which will help us come WC time.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

SUBSCRIBE NOW!“Shanghai has always been a special place for me, with great fans, unforgettable memories, and a real love for the game,” he added.The two-time Shanghai Masters champion last visited the city in 2024, spending a few fun-filled days exploring, meeting Novak Djokovic, watching Jannik Sinner, and even training indoors with Carlos Alcaraz, jokingly questioning what he was doing there.Federer boasts a 23-6 career record in Shanghai across eight appearances. On his debut in 2010, he defeated Novak Djokovic before falling to Andy Murray in the final. The same duo met in the 2012 semi-final, with Murray again prevailing in straight sets.PollWhich of Federer's past performances in Shanghai stands out to you the most?His 2014 title winHis 2017 championshipHis debut in 2010After a loss to Gael Monfils in 2013, Federer finally lifted his first title in China in 2014, defeating Djokovic and Gilles Simon. He was upset by Alberto Ramos-Vinolas in 2015 but returned in 2017 to claim his second Shanghai crown, beating Juan Martin del Potro and Rafael Nadal, and breaking Nadal’s serve three times in a dominant 6-4, 6-3 final.Federer’s later campaigns saw mixed results — a semi-final defeat to Borna Coric in 2018 and a quarter-final loss to Alexander Zverev in 2019, marking his last competitive appearance at the event.Last year, the Swiss maestro was warmly received in Shanghai, and in just two months, fans will once again see him grace the courts in one of his favorite tennis destinations.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

'Bumrah should’ve been told to miss IPL': Vengsarkar defends pacer against critics
Former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar believed Jasprit Bumrah should have skipped IPL 2025 to stay fresh for the England Test series. He also suggested that Virat Kohli should have played the series before retiring. Vengsarkar emphasised the importance of Test cricket, highlighting standout performances from Siraj, Gill, Rahul, Jaiswal, Pant and Sundar.

He also suggested that Virat Kohli should have played the series before retiring. Vengsarkar emphasised the importance of Test cricket, highlighting standout performances from Siraj, Gill, Rahul, Jaiswal, Pant and Sundar. He defended Bumrah's workload management, citing his back surgery. Dilip Vengsarkar and Jasprit Bumrah MUMBAI: Wading into the debate around Jasprit Bumrah's workload management, which saw him play just three out of five Tests in England, former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar has asserted that India's ace pacer should have been asked by the decision-makers in Indian cricket to miss IPL-2025 to keep himself refreshed and well-rested for the iconic India versus England five-Test series this summer, which ended in a 2-2 stalemate.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"Considering the importance of the India versus England Tests series and his fragile back, Bumrah should have been told by the BCCI, selectors and the Indian team management to miss IPL-2025. It was very important that we had a fully fit and refreshed Bumrah for this iconic series. If I was the India chief selector, I would have convinced Mukesh Ambani (Mumbai Indians owner) and Bumrah that it was important for Bumrah to miss the IPL for the England series, or play a lesser number of matches in the IPL. I’m sure that they would have agreed to do so. How Jasprit Bumrah is preparing for Lord's Test - batting, bowling and lot of jokes!“Who remembers the runs and wickets taken in the IPL? However, people will remember Mohammed Siraj's lion-hearted performance in this series (23 wickets in five Tests), Shubman Gill (754 runs in five Tests), KL Rahul (532), Yashasvi Jaiswal (411 runs) and Rishabh Pant's (479) sublime batting, and Washington Sundar's superb all-round performance (284 runs & seven wickets in four Tests). A series like this one takes place probably once in four years. I believe India are not playing a five-Test series till Jan 2027 (against Australia). It was a series for the ages and I wish Bumrah was available for almost all the Tests. We could have won the series if that was the case," Vengsarkar told TOI on Sunday.Returning from a back injury which forced him to miss the 2025 Champions Trophy in UAE, Bumrah played in 12 matches in IPL-2025 for MI, bowling 47.2 overs in which he took 18 wickets. The 31-year-old took 14 wickets in three Tests@26.00 in the Tendulkar-Anderson Trophy, and was under-fire for missing the crucial third and fifth Tests of the series due to workload management.However, Vengsarkar doesn't agree with Bumrah's critics who feel that he shouldn't miss Tests because of workload management issues. "You can’t blame Bumrah for missing matches at times. We must remember that Bumrah has undergone a back surgery. His back is vulnerable and we must be cautious with him. You can’t question his commitment for the country. He has given his all whenever he has played for India. I hope he returns for India after adequate rest and when fully fit," he felt. ‘Would have asked Kohli to play in England series before quitting Tests’Vengsarkar felt that in his own opinion, former India captain Virat Kohli, who quit Tests just before the England tour, should have been asked to take retirement after playing in the recently-held series. "If I was the India chief selector, I would have persuaded Virat to bid goodbye to Test cricket after playing the England series. We needed his class and experience in this series," the 116-Test veteran, who was India's chief selector from 2006-08, said.‘Gambhir wasn't out of line with curator’Vengsarkar opined that India's head coach Gautam Gambhir wasn't out of line with the Oval pitch curator Lee Fortis during their clash ahead of the fifth Test. Disagreeing with former Australia opener Matthew Hayden's recent remark on the controversy that Gambhir could have "used better language and toned it down." Vengsarkar, defending Gambhir, said, "As the head coach of the Indian team, Gambhir had every right to see the pitch from close quarters. When teams tour India, their entire team-and not just the coach and captain, examine the pitch minutely. Even their media inspects the pitch before the match. No one tells them anything. So, how are the rules different when we are playing in England? “Would Hayden, or any of the Aussie cricketers, take it well if a curator had asked them to stay away from the square ahead of an important match. If this had happened to the Aussies, they would have used the choices of words to show the curator his place."'England series showed good pitches can produce thrilling Test cricket’Meanwhile, Vengsarkar was all praise for the England & Wales Cricket Board for staging a thrilling series, which seems to have infused excitement back in Test cricket for a while "I must appreciate the culture of Test cricket in England. There were huge crowds for all the Tests, and the sporting wickets ensured that the result of all the five Tests was decided on the fifth and final day. This series, which will be remembered for ages, has revived the interest for Test cricket in cricket lovers. It has increased Test cricket’s importance. This shows that if you dish out good pitches, Test cricket can not just survive, but flourish too,” the 69-year-old praised.He advised the BCCI to take a cue from the ECB and prepare sporting tracks for the home Tests in the 2025-26 season. “I hope that India do the same in their upcoming international season (two Tests each against West Indies and South Africa) and provide good, sporting wickets for Tests. The BCCI must not pander to the wishes of short-sightedness of captains and coaches, who are just looking for short-term gains by winning matches and qualifying for the World Test Championship final," Vengsarkar asserted.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

The West Indies ultimately secured a five-wicket victory, leveling the series, powered by Roston Chase's unbeaten 49 and a crucial partnership with Justin Greaves. Babar Azam (Screengrab) Former Pakistan captain Babar Azam’s woeful run of form continued as he was clean bowled for a duck in the second ODI against the West Indies at Tarouba.Babar had scored a scratchy 47 in the first ODI but registered a three-ball duck in the second match, falling to Jayden Seales.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Babar was left visibly stunned, gesturing in disbelief at the brilliance of the delivery. While it was indeed a fine ball, his shot selection raised questions — attempting a flick with only the half-face of the bat against a moving delivery proved costly, as it shattered his stumps. His dismissal deepened Pakistan’s woes, with the team reeling at 139/6 in 33.5 overs at the time of writing.Babar walked in at 37/1 after Pakistan lost Saim Ayub in the ninth over, having opted to bat first. Seales, already in rhythm after dismissing Ayub, delivered two dot balls to start. His third delivery was fuller, seaming away just enough to beat Babar’s flick. Off-balance, Babar missed completely, and the ball snuck between bat and pad to crash into the stumps.The dismissal added to Babar’s ongoing struggles in ODIs this year, where he is averaging just over 30 at a sluggish strike rate of 80. His poor form has already cost him a place in Pakistan’s T20I squad, having been dropped due to slow scoring.PollWhat do you think about Babar Azam's performance in the second ODI against West Indies?He needs to improve his shot selectionHe should be dropped from the teamHe will bounce back in the next matchIt's just a phase, every player goes through itRoston Chase and Justin Greaves led the West Indies to a five-wicket victory over Pakistan with 10 balls to spare in the rain-reduced second one-day international on Sunday, leveling the three-match series at 1-1.Chase’s 49 not out off 47 balls included two sixes and the winning boundary as the West Indies scored 184-5 in 33.2 overs.The hosts were chasing a revised target of 181 in 35 overs under the DLS method after multiple rain interruptions saw Pakistan’s innings end at 171-7 in 37 overs. Right-arm fast bowler Jayden Seales took 3-23 in seven overs.The West Indies stumbled from 101-3 after 18 overs at the Brian Lara Stadium in Tarouba, Trinidad and Tobago, to 111-5 off 24 overs, including the wicket of Sherfane Rutherford, who hit a 33-ball 45 with three sixes and four fours.Chase and Greaves (26 off 31) then shared an unbroken 77-run partnership for the sixth wicket.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Shah Rukh Khan and Juhi Chawla own the three-time champions Kolkata Knight Riders, while Preity Zinta is one of the co-owners of the IPL 2025 finalists, Punjab Kings.Salman’s upcoming movie, Battle of Galwan, based on the 2020 India-China Galwan Valley conflict, is one of his most physically challenging roles to date.The film, directed by Apoorva Lakhia of Shootout at Lokhandwala fame, will feature Khan in intense action sequences and challenging shooting conditions in Ladakh."It is physically demanding. Every year, every month, every day it gets more and more difficult. I have to give more time now (for training). Earlier, I would do it (train) in one or two weeks; now I’m running, kicking, punching, and all that stuff. This film demands that," Khan told PTI.PollWould you like to see Salman Khan buy an IPL team in the future?Yes, definitely!No, I prefer him as an actor.Only if he can handle it.I have mixed feelings.The 59-year-old actor elaborated on the film’s challenging shooting schedule and locations."When I was signing the film, I thought it’s amazing, but it’s a very, very difficult film to do. I have 20 days (of work) in Ladakh and then seven to eight days (of shooting) in cold water. We will be shooting this month," Khan shared.The actor also confirmed that, unlike his traditional Eid releases, Battle of Galwan will hit theaters in January.In other developments, Khan announced that a sequel to his 2015 film Bajrangi Bhaijaan is also in progress.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

(Jono Searle/AAPImage via AP) Australia secured a 17-run victory over South Africa in the first T20 match in Darwin on Sunday, marking international cricket's return to the city after 17 years. Tim David's explosive 83-run innings, featuring eight sixes, propelled Australia to 178 all out, while South Africa managed 161-9 despite Ryan Rickelton's 71-run effort.It was the ninth straight win in T20Is for the Australian team, but interestingly, Afghanistan and India are still ahead in the list of most consecutive victories in T20Is by a full member nation. Both India and Afghanistan have won 12 T20Is in a row.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!The longest winning streak in T20I history belongs to Uganda, who racked up 17 consecutive victories. Previously, Pakistan and New Zealand had each managed nine wins on the trot, while England’s best run in the format stands at eight straight matches.Meanwhile, David's aggressive knock came off 52 balls and proved crucial after Australia lost five key batsmen within the first seven overs. His powerful hitting included several sixes that landed on the stadium roof.PollDo you believe Australia's T20 team can extend their winning streak to 12 matches?YesNoThe match also saw 19-year-old Kwena Maphaka become the youngest bowler among full ICC member countries to claim a four-wicket haul, finishing with figures of 4-20. However, his achievement was overshadowed by David's remarkable batting display.Australian captain Mitchell Marsh began the three-match series with a six off the first ball from Lungi Ngidi. The hosts then faced a collapse as Kagiso Rabada claimed both openers, and Maphaka made further inroads into the middle order.Travis Head departed for just 2 runs after being caught by Maphaka at short third man. Marsh followed soon after when Maphaka took a well-judged running catch at square leg.Cameron Green contributed a quickfire 35 off 13 balls before being caught by wicketkeeper Rickelton. Josh Inglis fell to George Linde's first delivery, failing to clear the point fielder.David’s innings received a lifeline when Tristan Stubbs dropped a straightforward catch in the outfield after the batsman had reached his fifty. He went on to form a 59-run partnership with Ben Dwarshuis, who scored 17.South Africa's chase began poorly, losing three wickets during the powerplay and slumping to 48-3. Captain Aiden Markram, back after resting during the Zimbabwe triangular series, briefly showed promise before being caught in the covers.Rickelton and Stubbs revived South Africa's hopes with a 72-run partnership. However, Josh Hazlewood's double strike in the 15th over shifted the momentum back to Australia.The visitors lost four wickets for just three runs as their chase faltered. Adam Zampa, despite struggling with a wet ball earlier, finished with figures of 2-33, dismissing Corbin Bosch and Senuran Muthusamy off the final two balls of his spell.Hazlewood ended with impressive figures of 3-27, while Dwarshuis matched him with 3-26. The victory extended Australia's winning streak in T20 internationals to nine matches.The match concluded dramatically when Nathan Ellis was run out off the final ball, marking the first time South Africa had bowled out Australia in a T20 match.

It is called Crew Medical Officer Digital Assistant or CMO-DA. This tool will help astronauts during long space missions. It will provide autonomous medical support. Testing shows high accuracy in diagnosing common issues. Future updates will integrate medical device data. Source: Google Cloud As human space missions venture farther into deep space, the challenge of maintaining crew health grows increasingly complex. Unlike current missions aboard the International Space Station (ISS), where astronauts rely heavily on constant communication with Earth-based medical teams, regular medication supplies, and the option to return within six months, future journeys to the Moon, Mars, and beyond demand greater medical self-sufficiency. NASA and Google have teamed up to develop a breakthrough solution: an AI-powered medical assistant designed to support astronauts autonomously during extended spaceflight.NASA calls for AI medical assistant to support astronauts on Moon and Mars missionsWith missions extending beyond low Earth orbit, astronauts will face significant hurdles in healthcare management. Presently, ISS crews benefit from:Continuous real-time communication with ground-based medical expertsRoutine delivery of medicines and medical suppliesEvacuation options within months if medical emergencies ariseHowever, for lunar and Mars expeditions, communication delays can stretch up to 20 minutes each way, resupply missions will be infrequent, and emergency returns could take months or years. This scenario creates a pressing need for onboard medical autonomy, enabling astronauts to diagnose and treat health issues without immediate Earth-based assistance.Source: NASANASA and Google collaboration: Developing the Crew Medical Officer Digital Assistant (CMO-DA)To meet these challenges, NASA has partnered with Google to create the Crew Medical Officer Digital Assistant (CMO-DA) — an AI-driven medical tool designed for autonomous use by astronauts. This digital assistant is intended to serve as a virtual healthcare provider in space, bridging the gap when a medical doctor is not present onboard and communication with Earth is limited or delayed.Key features of CMO-DA:Multimodal Interface: Allows interaction via speech, text, and image inputs to facilitate easy use in space conditions.Cloud-Based Infrastructure: Operates within Google Cloud’s Vertex AI environment, enabling continuous application development and AI model training.Collaborative AI Model Development: NASA maintains ownership of the app’s source code and contributes actively to refine AI models alongside Google’s technology and third-party integrations.NASA’s AI medical assistant achieves high accuracy in testing key medical scenariosCMO-DA has already undergone preliminary testing using three simulated medical cases: ankle injury, flank pain, and ear pain. A panel comprising two physicians and one astronaut assessed the assistant’s performance across four key areas:Initial patient assessmentMedical history takingClinical reasoning and diagnosisTreatment planningThe results were encouraging, with diagnostic accuracies recorded as:88% for ankle injury74% for flank pain80% for ear painThese outcomes indicate strong potential for the assistant to provide reliable autonomous medical support during space missions.NASA’s plan to enhance CMO-DA for advanced space healthcareNASA plans an incremental development approach to continuously improve the CMO-DA system. Upcoming updates will focus on:Integrating medical device data: Incorporating inputs from onboard diagnostic tools for richer information.Enhancing situational awareness: Adapting AI algorithms to account for spaceflight-specific factors such as microgravity’s effects on human physiology.Contextualized medical advice: Delivering treatment recommendations tailored to the unique environment and conditions of deep space.This will enable the assistant to offer more precise, relevant, and timely healthcare guidance in the isolated and challenging environment of space.How NASA’s AI medical assistant could transform healthcare worldwideWhile designed for space, the implications of this AI-powered medical assistant extend far beyond astronaut health. David Cruley, a Google Public Sector engineer involved in the project, noted that although regulatory approval plans for terrestrial use are not yet confirmed, success in space missions could catalyze the adoption of similar AI tools on Earth.Possible benefits on Earth include:Improved medical care in remote and underserved areasEnhanced diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision supportIncreased accessibility to healthcare expertise in environments lacking specialistsNASA and Google also envision that lessons learned from CMO-DA’s development will accelerate innovation in the broader field of AI-driven medicine, ultimately improving patient care worldwide.Also Read | 4.56-billion-year-old McDonough meteorite older than Earth crashes into Georgia home; stuns scientistsAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Swift has cultivated a loyal fanbase through immersive experiences and reclaimed ownership of her music, disrupting industry norms. Her relentless work ethic and strategic decisions have propelled her into a powerful figure, offering a blueprint for success in any field.  Behind the glittering lights and chart-topping hits lies a carefully crafted strategy that has propelled Taylor Swift into one of the most powerful figures in the global entertainment industry. A NASA engineer has cracked the code behind Taylor Swift’s meteoric rise to global superstardom, revealing insights that extend far beyond her music. Sinéad O’Sullivan, a Harvard Business School graduate and seasoned rocket scientist, spent years analyzing Swift’s career and business strategies.In her upcoming book Good Ideas and Power Moves, O’Sullivan says that Swift’s success isn’t just about catchy songs or lucky breaks. Instead, it is the result of deliberate, strategic moves that anyone can learn from. From building a loyal fanbase to rewriting industry rules, Swift has crafted a personal brand and empire that generates billions and reshapes markets, offering a blueprint for success in any field.Taylor Swift’s strategic empire-building beyond musicO’Sullivan’s research highlights that Swift’s genius lies in her ability to construct entire worlds, not just songs. Taylor Swift has expertly crafted an expansive fan universe known as the “Swiftverse,” which goes far beyond her music to create an immersive, interactive experience for her fans, affectionately called Swifties. This world includes elaborate storytelling, hidden Easter eggs in lyrics, themed visuals, and multi-platform social media engagement that encourages fans to connect deeply, not only with her art but also with each other.This fosters a strong sense of community and loyalty, transforming fans into passionate supporters who actively drive her brand’s growth. The massive success of her Eras Tour exemplifies this phenomenon, injecting an estimated $5 billion into the US economy through ticket sales, travel, accommodations, merchandise, and job creation, especially boosting sectors like tourism and retail during a crucial post-pandemic recovery phase.Taylor Swift’s control over music rights and relentless work ethicA cornerstone of Swift’s empire is her strategic decision to reclaim ownership of her early work by re-recording her first six albums as “Taylor’s Version.” This move disrupted conventional music industry norms after her masters were sold without her consent, allowing her to regain financial control and send a powerful message about artist empowerment and creative agency.Beyond this, Swift’s meteoric rise is fueled by her relentless work ethic, unwavering self-belief, and deliberate choices. Balancing intensive touring, continuous music production, and broad business ventures, she demonstrates that meaningful success comes from taking risks, learning from failures, and staying true to one’s vision. Her journey offers a blueprint for aspiring entrepreneurs and artists on the importance of resilience, persistence, and owning one’s path to success.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Scientists are studying this biological marvel to inspire the creation of super-durable materials. This research could revolutionize industries by enabling the development of advanced cutting tools, biomedical implants, and self-repairing structures, mimicking nature's ingenious design. Source: The University of Chicago You’d expect the hardest teeth in nature to belong to sharks, crocodiles, or some ancient dino. But surprisingly the title goes to a slow-moving, algae-scraping mollusc called the chiton. This groundbreaking new study published in Science reveals that chitons, marine molluscs you’ve probably never heard of, grow teeth that aren’t just hard, they're harder than stainless steel, zirconium oxide, and even human enamel. And here’s the real kicker: they do it at room temperature, using a precise, protein-controlled biological system.Scientists say this process could inspire the next generation of supermaterials used in cutting tools, surgical implants, dental prosthetics, and protective coatings , all with nanoscale precision. Let’s dive into the science behind nature’s hardest, most magnetic teeth. Curious? Let’s break down what the study found and why it's got scientists (and engineers) geeking out.What are chitons and why do their teeth matter?Chitons are small, ancient marine molluscs that cling to rocks and feed by scraping algae off surfaces using a ribbon-like tongue called a radula. The teeth on this radula are constantly worn down and regrown and they happen to be the hardest known biological material on Earth, even stronger than enamel or bone.Scientists have long been fascinated by the strength of chiton teeth, but this new study reveals why they're so strong and how their structure could influence materials science.The science behind chiton teeth: Built to crushThe researchers used high-resolution electron microscopy and spectrometry to analyse the nanostructure of chiton teeth. What they found was extraordinary:The teeth contain magnetite, an iron-based mineral, arranged in a tightly packed, nanoscale crystalline structure.These crystals are embedded in a soft organic matrix, which offers both rigidity and flexibility, a rare combination in natural materials.This combination makes the teeth not just hard but incredibly wear-resistant, ideal for scraping rock surfaces without damage.Why this study could change future materialsThe implications of this research stretch far beyond marine biology. Materials inspired by chiton teeth could be used to:Build durable coatings for cutting tools, drills, and other high-friction equipmentCreate longer-lasting materials for aerospace or biomedical applicationsDevelop self-repairing synthetic structures that mimic how chitons regrow teethThe study's lead author, Dr. Erika Easterling, explained that nature often holds the blueprints for advanced engineering: "By studying organisms like chitons, we can reverse-engineer solutions for some of our toughest material challenges."Now that the microstructure of chiton teeth is better understood, researchers are working on synthetic replication using nanomaterials. The goal is to reproduce this biological architecture in labs and eventually at scale, creating next-gen materials that combine hardness, flexibility, and self-renewal.Nature's toughest teeth may soon inspire industrial revolutions, proving once again that biology often beats the lab in innovation.Also read| These 15 science facts are so bizarre, you'll think we're lying (but we're not)About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

This gas giant, larger than Saturn but less massive, orbits a star only one-fifth the Sun's mass. The discovery suggests that large planets might be more common around small stars than previously believed. Source: Earth.com  Astronomers have discovered a giant planet named TOI-6894b orbiting a very small red dwarf star that has only one-fifth the mass of the Sun. Despite the star’s small size and low brightness, TOI-6894b is larger than Saturn but has only half its mass. This surprising discovery challenges previous ideas that such tiny stars cannot form or hold large gas planets. According to a study published in Nature Astronomy and reported by Earth.com, large planets may be more common around small stars than scientists once believed, opening new possibilities for understanding how planets form.Huge planet discovered orbiting one of the smallest red dwarf stars: TOI-6894BTOI-6894b was found using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Its host star, TOI-6894, is a cool red dwarf, much smaller and dimmer than our Sun. Despite this, TOI-6894b has a radius larger than Saturn but with only half its mass. This makes the star the smallest known to have such a large gas giant orbiting it. This discovery challenges the assumption that small stars cannot form or hold giant planets.Challenging planet formation theories: How TOI-6894b formed around a tiny starTraditional planet formation theories, such as core accretion, suggest that low-mass stars have thin discs of gas and dust that are not enough to build large planets. Scientists believe TOI-6894b could have formed through a modified core accretion process or through gravitational instability, where parts of the disc collapse quickly under their own gravity. Neither explanation perfectly fits current data, highlighting the need for further research to understand how such a massive planet can form around a tiny star.James Webb Telescope to study TOI-6894b’s rare methane and ammonia atmosphereTOI-6894b orbits far enough from its star to have a relatively cool atmosphere, with an estimated temperature of 420 Kelvin (about 147 degrees Celsius). Its atmosphere is expected to be rich in methane, which is rare among exoplanets, and may contain ammonia as well. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will observe this planet soon, providing valuable data to better understand its atmosphere and formation. This could offer important clues about planet formation in environments very different from our own solar system.Implications for astronomy and the Milky WayThis discovery has big implications for astronomy. Since most stars in the Milky Way are small red dwarfs, finding a giant planet around one suggests that such planets may be more common than previously thought. The study involved researchers from the University of Warwick, University College London, and the University of Birmingham. TOI-6894b challenges existing models and will help scientists improve their understanding of planet formation and the diversity of planetary systems in our galaxy.Also read | Seven superclouds: Giant gas neighbors of our solar system discovered About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

This visual evidence provides an unprecedented opportunity to study seismic ruptures in real-time. The analysis of this footage could refine earthquake prediction models and enhance early-warning systems, potentially saving lives in the future. Representative AI Image For the first time in history, scientists have captured clear footage of the Earth’s surface physically splitting during a powerful earthquake. The dramatic event, recorded by high-speed cameras and ground sensors in a remote seismic hotspot, shows the crust tearing apart along a fault line in real time. This unprecedented visual evidence offers scientists an extraordinary opportunity to study the mechanics of seismic ruptures, potentially improving early-warning systems and our understanding of how earthquakes propagate. Experts are calling it a milestone moment in the field of geophysics.How the Earth split was capturedThe footage was obtained during a recent earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale. Researchers had positioned advanced recording equipment in the region after detecting increased seismic activity over the past few months. When the quake struck, cameras captured the ground shifting violently, creating a visible crack stretching hundreds of meters. Normally, such events occur too quickly and unpredictably to record in detail, making this a rare scientific achievement.Pulse-like rupture and curved slip - Analysis of Myanmar earthquake ruptureWhy this matters for earthquake scienceSeismologists explain that seeing the rupture unfold on camera allows them to analyze fault movement frame by frame. This can reveal the speed of the split, the energy released, and how the rupture propagated along the fault. The findings could refine earthquake prediction models and help urban planners design more resilient infrastructure in quake-prone areas.With precise rupture dynamics now observable, scientists believe they can enhance algorithms used in earthquake early-warning networks. By recognizing specific seismic signatures just before a rupture occurs, these systems might provide precious seconds or even minutes of warning, potentially saving lives.Next steps in the researchThe video will undergo detailed analysis by an international team of geologists and engineers. They plan to compare the footage with seismic data from the same event to build a more complete understanding of the quake. In addition, the team intends to simulate the rupture in advanced earthquake laboratories to test how different soil types and fault conditions affect ground movement. This could help forecast how future quakes might impact specific regions. Results from this research could be published within the next year, offering new insights into one of Earth’s most powerful natural processes.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

While Yuri orbited Earth on the ISS, Ekaterina waited in Houston, bridging the distance through a live video link. This extraordinary event showcased love's ability to transcend boundaries, blending space exploration with personal connection and capturing global attention. Source: Russia Beyond On August 10, 2003, the International Space Station became the setting for one of the most extraordinary weddings ever recorded. Orbiting Earth at 28,000 km/h, Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko said “I do” to his American fiancée Ekaterina Dmitriev, who stood waiting 400 km below at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.This was no publicity stunt—it was a daring blend of love and spaceflight, navigating complex legal, technical, and cultural hurdles. In a moment that bridged two worlds—the boundless expanse of space and the intimacy of human connection—it proved that even in the most advanced realms of exploration, the heart still finds its own orbit.International Space Station becomes the world’s most unusual wedding venueThe ISS is a multi-national laboratory in low Earth orbit, a place where every minute is carefully scheduled for experiments, maintenance, and communications. Weddings were not part of its official mission objectives.Yet, on that August day, the station’s communication systems—designed for critical mission updates, data transfer, and crew coordination—were temporarily adapted to facilitate a marriage ceremony. At the time, the ISS was orbiting roughly 400 km above Earth, completing one orbit every 90 minutes. That meant that during the wedding, the station likely passed over multiple continents, giving “worldwide coverage” a very literal meaning.How Russian cosmonaut long-distance romance led to the first wedding in spaceYuri Malenchenko, already a veteran of multiple spaceflights, had spent much of his professional life training and working away from home. Ekaterina Dmitriev, a US-based space enthusiast of Russian descent, had met him years earlier through mutual acquaintances in the aerospace field.Their relationship was a lesson in long-distance endurance. Malenchenko often trained in Star City, Russia, while Dmitriev lived in the United States. They sustained their romance through phone calls, occasional visits, and a shared passion for space exploration. The couple initially planned a traditional wedding with 200 guests in attendance. But when Malenchenko’s mission aboard the ISS was unexpectedly extended, postponing the wedding by months or even years, they faced a choice—delay the marriage or find a way to bridge the gap.They chose the latter. After securing approval from Russian space authorities, they planned what became the first and only marriage ceremony conducted from space.Inside the International Space Station’s first-ever wedding ceremonyConducting a wedding between space and Earth involved complex coordination between Roscosmos (Russian space agency) and NASA. The ISS’s Ku-band communication system was used to transmit live video and audio between the spacecraft and mission control.Key elements of the ceremony:Visual connection: Dmitriev stood in a decorated room at NASA’s Houston facility, while Malenchenko appeared live on a monitor from the ISS.Dress code: Malenchenko wore his formal Russian space suit with a bow tie as a symbolic gesture. Dmitriev wore a traditional ivory wedding gown.Music in orbit: Astronaut Ed Lu, serving as Malenchenko’s best man, played the wedding march on a small keyboard aboard the ISS.Cultural touches: Dmitriev walked down the aisle to David Bowie’s “Space Oddity”, linking the ceremony to space pop culture.Symbolic gestures: The bride blew a kiss toward the camera, and the groom reciprocated from orbit.From orbit to Earth: The reunion after the first wedding in spaceEkaterina Dmitriev later told the New York Times that, “As Yuri was further away, he was closer to me because of the communication we have.” She called the orbital wedding a reflection of “mankind’s desire and need to go one step further.”Marriage became a symbol of human adaptability—proving that even in the most extreme environments, people find ways to preserve traditions and emotional bonds. It also captured the imagination of the public, blending romance, technology, and exploration in a single event. Following the ceremony, Malenchenko continued his ISS duties for several months. In October 2003, he returned to Earth, finally meeting his wife in person as her husband. Photographs of their reunion marked the end of one of the most remarkable long-distance weddings in history.Also Read | 4.56-billion-year-old McDonough meteorite older than Earth crashes into Georgia home; stuns scientistsAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

These structures, thousands of light-years across, are potential star birthplaces, possibly formed from the Milky Way's spiral arms. The discovery, enabled by advanced mapping, reveals a galactic framework influencing star formation and galactic evolution, opening new avenues for astronomical research. Source: ScienceNews In a stunning breakthrough, astronomers have discovered seven massive structures of gas known as superclouds just beyond our solar system. These immense clouds, stretching thousands of light-years across, are likely the birthplaces of stars and may have formed from material stripped from the spiral arms of the Milky Way. While two of them, including the well-known Radcliffe Wave, had been identified earlier, five are brand new discoveries. Lying nearly parallel to each other and undulating in wave-like patterns, these superclouds are our largest local neighbours in space and are rewriting what we know about interstellar structure and star formation.A hidden interstellar structure revealed by modern mappingThanks to advanced space mapping using data from the Gaia spacecraft, a team of astronomers led by Lilly Kormann from the University of Vienna has charted a detailed 3D map of interstellar dust and hydrogen within 50 million square light-years around the Sun. What they initially saw were patches of high-density dust, but a closer analysis revealed that many of these dense zones were linked together in long, coherent structures. By connecting the dots, the team identified seven vast superclouds, including the Radcliffe Wave and a previously known one called the Split, lying close to the solar system in an almost parallel arrangement.Colossal dimensions and massEach of the seven superclouds stretches between 3,000 and 8,000 light-years in length and holds gas weighing 800,000 to 3.5 million times the mass of the Sun. These massive forms are not only among the largest known local structures in our galaxy, but researchers believe they might be even larger than measured, as parts likely extend beyond the edges of the current dust map. Positioned along the Milky Way’s disc, these superclouds form a sort of galactic framework that may shape the way stars and star systems, including ours, are created and distributed across space.Star nurseries within the supercloudsWhat makes this discovery especially important is that most known stellar nurseries, regions where new stars are born, are located inside these superclouds, particularly along their central spines. This pattern strongly suggests that superclouds play a foundational role in star formation, acting as the “mothers” to smaller, denser gas clouds that collapse under gravity to form stars. Scientists now believe these superclouds represent an early stage in the hierarchy of star-making, offering insight into how vast structures break down into smaller ones, eventually producing stars, solar systems, and perhaps even planets like Earth.The mystery of the wavesMost of the superclouds show a distinct wave-like form, rising and falling in an undulating pattern above and below the flat disc of the Milky Way. Only one, the Split, remains relatively straight. The fact that so many of these gas clouds zigzag in unison suggests there’s a common physical mechanism shaping them, possibly linked to galactic gravity, spiral arm dynamics, or even external galactic forces. Even more intriguing is how their average densities remain strikingly similar, despite differences in the amount of material packed into each section. This hints at a larger, still-unknown system regulating their structure and behaviour.What this means for astronomyThis discovery marks a turning point in our understanding of the local interstellar medium, the cloud-like environment that surrounds our solar system. As astrophysicist Bruce Elmegreen put it, we are only now beginning to "see what is very local to us," after decades of struggling to separate nearby structures from distant background noise. The identification of these seven superclouds gives scientists a valuable new framework to study star formation, interstellar physics, and the evolution of our galaxy on a large scale.

Meteorite older than Earth smashes house roof in Georgia; scientists trace rock to asteroid belt - video
A meteorite fragment that crashed through a Georgia home's roof in June has been identified as being older than Earth. Originating from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, the rock formed 4.56 billion years ago. Scientists emphasize that studying such meteorites is crucial for planetary defense, potentially helping to prevent catastrophic impacts in the future.

Originating from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, the rock formed 4.56 billion years ago. Scientists emphasize that studying such meteorites is crucial for planetary defense, potentially helping to prevent catastrophic impacts in the future.  A meteorite fragment that tore through the roof of a Georgia home last June has been found to be older than Earth itself, according to scientists at the University of Georgia.Geologist Scott Harris told Fox News Digital that the rock, which fell on June 26 near Atlanta, originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Analysis shows it formed 4.56 billion years ago — slightly before the birth of the Earth, estimated at 4.54 billion years.A fiery descentEyewitnesses reported seeing a bright fireball streak across the sky that day. Harris was quickly called to investigate the home, where he traced the meteorite's dramatic path: A clean hole through the roof and an air ductPenetration through insulation and the ceiling Impact with the floor, leaving a crater the size of a large cherry tomatoPollHave you ever witnessed a meteor shower or meteorite fall?Yes, I haveNo, neverThe fragment hit with such force that part of it was pulverised "like somebody hitting it with a sledgehammer," Harris said. The rock briefly broke the sound barrier before impact.No danger this time — but a reminder for the futureWhile the small size of the meteorite posed no threat to the homeowners, Harris said studying such falls is crucial for planetary defence. Understanding how meteorites travel through space and into Earth's atmosphere could help scientists predict — and prevent — catastrophic impacts.He pointed to Nasa's DART mission as an example of potential defence, where a spacecraft successfully altered the path of an asteroid through kinetic impact."If you move an asteroid early enough, you can get it to avoid us altogether," Harris said.

This image provided by NASA shows, from left, NASA's SpaceX Crew-10 members JAXA  Four astronauts have safely returned to Earth after spending five months aboard the International space station (ISS). Their SpaceX capsule splashed down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California on Saturday, a day after leaving the orbiting laboratory.Nasa’s Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan’s Takuya Onishi, and Russia’s Kirill Peskov launched in March to replace the two Nasa astronauts stranded on Boeing’s Starliner following its failed test mission. “Welcome home,” Mission Control at SpaceX radioed as the capsule parachuted into the water.Starliner’s malfunctions forced Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to remain in orbit for more than nine months instead of a planned week. Nasa eventually ordered the capsule to return empty, transferring the pair to a SpaceX flight. Wilmore has since retired from Nasa.Before departure on Friday, McClain said, “We want this mission, our mission, to be a reminder of what people can do when we work together, when we explore together.” She said she was looking forward to “doing nothing for a couple of days” in Houston, while her crewmates hoped for hot showers and burgers.This was SpaceX’s first Nasa crew splashdown in the Pacific in 50 years, with Elon Musk’s company shifting returns from Florida to California earlier this year to reduce debris risks. The last Nasa astronauts to land in the Pacific were part of the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz mission, a historic joint effort between the US and the Soviet Union.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

NASA to build nuclear reactor on Moon by 2030: What is behind the ambitious plan?
NASA plans to establish a continuous lunar presence by 2030 with a nuclear reactor, crucial for powering habitats and operations during long lunar nights. This initiative supports the Artemis program and addresses the limitations of solar power in shadowed regions. Amidst growing international competition, this project aims to secure U.S. leadership in space and enable future Mars missions.

This initiative supports the Artemis program and addresses the limitations of solar power in shadowed regions. Amidst growing international competition, this project aims to secure U.S. leadership in space and enable future Mars missions.  NASA has unveiled plans to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2030 as part of its Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the lunar surface and establish a sustainable presence. This ambitious move comes amid increasing international competition in space exploration, with countries like China and Russia developing similar nuclear-powered lunar projects. The reactor is designed to provide a continuous, reliable source of energy to power habitats, scientific instruments, rovers, and mining operations, especially during the Moon’s lengthy nights and permanently shadowed craters where solar power is ineffective.The development of this nuclear power system marks a crucial step toward creating the infrastructure necessary for long-term lunar habitation and resource utilization. Unlike previous missions that relied heavily on solar panels and limited battery storage, a nuclear reactor could enable round-the-clock operations and pave the way for deeper space exploration, including future missions to Mars.Why NASA wants to build a nuclear reactor on the MoonNASA has been quietly developing small nuclear power systems in collaboration with the Department of Energy for years. The plan is to deploy a small modular nuclear reactor capable of producing at least 100 kilowatts of electricity, enough to power about 80 homes on Earth. This reactor will provide continuous energy without interruption, a critical advantage over solar power, which falters during the Moon’s two-week-long nights.The Moon’s south pole is a particular focus due to its abundant water ice deposits, essential for life support and fuel production. However, these craters are permanently shadowed, receiving little to no sunlight, rendering solar energy impractical. The nuclear reactor will enable operations in these challenging environments, supporting scientific research, mining activities, and habitat life-support systems.NASA’s Acting Administrator Sean Duffy has emphasized the importance of this technology for Artemis’ goals, calling it a “game changer” for sustained lunar presence. The project is also seen as a testbed for technologies that could eventually support human missions to Mars, where solar energy is even less reliable.Geopolitical stakes and the race for lunar infrastructureThe push for a nuclear reactor on the Moon comes at a time of heightened geopolitical competition in space. China announced plans in 2025 to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2035, while Russia has also expressed ambitions in this domain. Establishing nuclear infrastructure is more than a technical achievement; it signals a country’s ability to exert influence and control over critical lunar regions.Under the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, no nation can claim sovereignty over the Moon or other celestial bodies. However, building infrastructure such as nuclear reactors and bases effectively sets “keep-out zones” around these installations. These zones grant operators significant control over access to nearby resources, like the valuable ice deposits at the lunar south pole, which could be used to produce rocket fuel and sustain life.Experts view NASA’s project as a strategic move to maintain U.S. leadership in space exploration and to shape international norms for the responsible and peaceful use of nuclear power beyond Earth. Transparency, adherence to international guidelines, and cooperation will be essential to prevent conflict and ensure that space remains a domain for peaceful exploration.Why nuclear power is essential for the future of space explorationSolar panels have powered numerous space missions successfully, but their limitations are becoming increasingly apparent as humans prepare for long-term habitation beyond Earth. The Moon’s long nights and shadowed craters present significant challenges for solar energy, while Mars’ greater distance from the Sun further reduces its effectiveness.A nuclear reactor on the Moon can provide a stable, high-density power source capable of supporting demanding applications such as 3D printing of habitats, life support systems, communication networks, and scientific experiments. It also reduces reliance on expensive and logistically complex resupply missions from Earth.While concerns about safety and radiation risks exist, NASA and international space agencies adhere to strict safety protocols. The use of radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) in past missions, such as the Voyager probes and Mars rovers, has demonstrated the feasibility and safety of nuclear power in space. The planned lunar reactor would be designed with containment and fail-safe measures to minimize risks.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Lovell's legacy extends beyond space exploration, marked by his post-NASA career and lasting honors. Source: NASA James A. Lovell Jr., the famed astronaut and commander of NASA’s Apollo 13 mission, has died at 97. Lovell passed away on August 8, 2025, in Lake Forest, Illinois, his family confirmed in a statement to NASA. Though Lovell never walked on the Moon, his leadership during Apollo 13’s near-disastrous oxygen tank explosion turned the mission into one of space exploration’s greatest rescue stories. His calm, quick thinking under intense pressure saved the lives of his crew and inspired millions worldwide. Lovell’s heroism was immortalized in the 1995 film Apollo 13, where Tom Hanks portrayed him. Beyond his space legacy, Lovell remains a symbol of resilience and courage, admired by generations of astronauts, scientists, and space enthusiasts alike, continuing to inspire future exploration.Jim Lovell’s early life and path to NASABorn March 25, 1928, in Cleveland, Ohio, James Arthur Lovell Jr. lost his father at a young age and was raised in Milwaukee by his mother. Fascinated by rocketry as a teenager, he even built a homemade gunpowder rocket—a passion that eventually shaped his career.After attending the University of Wisconsin–Madison for two years, Lovell entered the US Naval Academy, graduating in 1952. He went on to become a Navy test pilot before being selected in 1962 as part of NASA’s second group of astronauts, destined for the Gemini and Apollo programs.Jim Lovell record-breaking space career before Apollo 13Before Apollo 13, Lovell already held the record for most hours in space among astronauts of the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo eras—logging over 715 hours.Gemini 7 (1965) – Flew with Frank Borman on a 14-day mission, achieving the first space rendezvous.Gemini 12 (1966) – Commanded the final Gemini mission with Buzz Aldrin, demonstrating critical spacewalking techniques.Apollo 8 (1968) – Served as command module pilot on the first human mission to orbit the Moon, delivering the famous “plaster of Paris” description of its surface and witnessing the iconic Earthrise photograph.By the time Apollo 13 launched, Lovell was one of NASA’s most experienced astronauts.Jim Lovell, Apollo 13 mission journey Apollo 13 spacecraft damaged: The oxygen tank blast that changed NASA historyApollo 13 lifted off on April 11, 1970 with Lovell as commander, Fred W. Haise Jr. as lunar module pilot, and John L. “Jack” Swigert Jr. as command module pilot. The plan was for Lovell and Haise to land in the Fra Mauro highlands while Swigert orbited above.But 56 hours into the mission, roughly 200,000 miles from Earth, disaster struck. An oxygen tank in the service module exploded after a damaged wire ignited during a routine stir. The blast crippled the spacecraft—knocking out power, oxygen, and water supplies. It was then that the phrase—misquoted in popular culture as “Houston, we have a problem”—entered the American lexicon. In reality, Swigert first radioed, “Houston, we’ve had a problem,” with Lovell repeating it shortly afterward.Apollo 13 crisis management: How the lunar module saved the crewWith the main command module crippled, the astronauts and NASA engineers devised an audacious survival plan—use the lunar module (LM) as a lifeboat. Designed for only two astronauts for two days, the LM now had to sustain three astronauts for four days.To conserve resources, they:Powered down lights, heaters, and non-essential systemsEndured cabin temperatures of 38°F (3°C)Survived on minimal rations, including hot dog packets for moistureBuilt a makeshift carbon dioxide filter from duct tape, plastic bags, and a sock to keep the air breathableAn immediate return to Earth was too risky, so Apollo 13 looped around the Moon for a slingshot trajectory home. Lovell manually guided crucial rocket burns using Earth’s position through the spacecraft window as a navigation point.Apollo 13’s safe return: From ocean rescue to Presidential honourOn April 17, 1970, after one of the most tense survival stories in modern history, Apollo 13 splashed down safely in the Pacific Ocean, 610 miles southeast of American Samoa. Three orange-and-white parachutes signaled the end of the crisis. President Richard Nixon awarded Lovell, Haise, and Swigert the Presidential Medal of Freedom, calling the mission “a successful failure”—failed in its lunar landing but victorious in its safe return.Lovell co-authored the 1994 book Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13 with Jeffrey Kluger, which became the basis for Ron Howard’s hit film Apollo 13. In the movie, Tom Hanks played Lovell, immortalizing his calm leadership for a new generation.Lovell even made a cameo as the captain of the USS Iwo Jima, the recovery ship that retrieved the Apollo 13 crew.James Lovell’s life After NASA: Leadership, family, and lasting honoursLovell retired from NASA and the Navy in 1973, going on to lead the Bay-Houston Towing Company and hold senior roles in telecommunications. He also ran Lovell Communications, a Chicago-based consulting firm. His family operated a Lake Forest restaurant decorated with space memorabilia until it closed in 2015. Lovell is survived by his four children—James III (Jay), Jeffrey, Barbara, and Susan—11 grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren. His wife of more than 60 years, Marilyn Lovell, died in 2023.In addition to the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Lovell was awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor by President Bill Clinton in 1995. In later years, Lovell often reflected that while missing the Moon was a disappointment, Apollo 13’s rescue was a greater triumph.“It was a triumph in a different direction—getting people back from a certain catastrophe,” he said.Also Read | NASA Hubble Space Telescope captures image of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS speeding at 130,000 mphAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

The cause of death was not immediately disclosed.Lovell was a pioneering figure in human spaceflight, being the first astronaut to make four spaceflights and logging over 715 hours in space. Before Apollo 13, he flew on the Gemini 7, Gemini 12, and Apollo 8 missions. Apollo 8, which orbited the moon without landing, made Lovell the first person to see the moon up close twice, reported CNN.During the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission, Lovell commanded the crew alongside astronauts John Swigert Jr and Fred Haise Jr. About 200,000 miles from Earth, an oxygen tank in their service module exploded, crippling their power and life support systems. Lovell famously informed mission control, “Houston, we’ve had a problem.”With their lunar landing abandoned, the crew had to perform critical engine burns to loop around the far side of the moon and set a course back to Earth. After a tense journey, they splashed down safely in the South Pacific Ocean about three days later. The mission became known as the “successful failure” of the Apollo program.The dramatic story of Apollo 13 was later portrayed in Ron Howard’s 1995 film, “Apollo 13.”Lovell’s family released a statement requesting privacy and said they were “saddened to announce the passing of our beloved father, USN Captain James A ‘Jim’ Lovell, a Navy pilot and officer, astronaut, leader, and space explorer.” They added, “We are enormously proud of his amazing life and career accomplishments, highlighted by his legendary leadership in pioneering human space flight. But, to all of us, he was Dad, Granddad, and the Leader of our family. Most importantly, he was our Hero.”Acting Nasa administrator Sean Duffy praised Lovell’s legacy, saying his “calm strength under pressure helped return the crew safely to Earth and demonstrated the quick thinking and innovation that informed future Nasa missions.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The James Webb Space Telescope spotted the gas giant. It is within the star's habitable zone. The exoplanet is closest to our solar system. Scientists are excited about future studies. This discovery opens doors for interstellar exploration. It also fuels science fiction fans' imagination. Image: Space.com In a stunning breakthrough, astronomers using NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have found strong evidence of a new exoplanet orbiting Alpha Centauri A, the closest sun-like star to Earth, just 4.37 light-years away. Using its Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and a coronagraph to block stellar glare, JWST captured a faint object believed to be a gas giant within the star’s habitable zone. Though not suitable for life as we know it, the potential planet represents a major leap in exoplanetary science and could be the closest directly imaged world outside our solar system.James Webb telescope captures glimpse into a nearby system Alpha Centauri A is part of the Alpha Centauri triple-star system, which also includes Alpha Centauri B and the red dwarf Proxima Centauri. While Proxima has two confirmed planets, including the potentially habitable Proxima b, Alpha Centauri A has long been a target of interest due to its similarities to our own sun. The discovery of a candidate planet orbiting it is not only thrilling; it is historic.What makes this discovery even more compelling is the location of the possible exoplanet: within the habitable zone of Alpha Centauri A. At a distance of two astronomical units from its host star (twice the distance from Earth to the Sun), the gas giant lies in the region where liquid water could exist, at least on moons if it has any. However, as a gas giant, it is unlikely to support life directly.Cutting-edge tech behind the discovery The JWST used its Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) along with a coronagraphic mask to suppress the overwhelming light from Alpha Centauri A, revealing the faint signature of the suspected planet. The object is about 10,000 times fainter than its host star, an extraordinary contrast achieved thanks to the telescope’s unprecedented sensitivity.If confirmed, this would be the closest exoplanet ever directly imaged around a sun-like star and the first such planet to be observed at this proximity. The discovery hints at the possibility that planetary systems similar to ours may be more common and closer than previously thought.A new era for nearby exploration Scientists are already excited about the opportunities this planet offers. As Charles Beichman of NASA’s Exoplanet Science Institute noted, the proximity of Alpha Centauri A makes it one of the best candidates for future in-depth studies. With new instruments and missions on the horizon, this system could become a focal point for the next generation of space exploration.While promising, the object is still considered a planet “candidate.” Further observation and analysis are needed to confirm its nature. If validated, it would mark a major milestone and open the door to studying exoplanets not just light-years away but potentially within reach of future interstellar probes.From science to sci-fi The discovery has also thrilled science fiction fans, especially since James Cameron’s Avatar series is set on Pandora, a lush, habitable moon orbiting a gas giant around Alpha Centauri A. This cinematic connection has long stirred public imagination about what might exist in our cosmic neighborhood. The blend of scientific discovery and popular culture helps raise awareness and excitement about space exploration. It also underscores the importance of investing in advanced telescopes and missions that push the boundaries of our knowledge.Now, with real scientific data pointing to a massive planet in that same system, the boundary between fiction and possibility feels thinner than ever. While this newfound world is unlikely to host life itself, its presence raises the possibility of moons or other celestial bodies in its orbit that could offer more Earth-like conditions.It also reinforces the cultural and scientific fascination with Alpha Centauri as humanity's first potential step beyond the solar system — a destination for future probes or even interstellar travel concepts like Breakthrough Starshot.With the James Webb Space Telescope continuing to exceed expectations, discoveries like this are no longer confined to science fiction. They are part of a new, unfolding reality — one where humanity’s view of the cosmos expands with every image, every pixel, and every distant light revealed.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

This facility will primarily support the Next Generation Launch Vehicle (NGLV) and act as a backup for heavy-lift vehicles. The project emphasizes collaboration with Indian private players and MSMEs, aligning with the nation's self-reliance goals. Representative image (TOI)  BENGALURU: India’s third satellite launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota is slated to be fully operational only by March 2029, according to the Department of Space. The ambitious project, seen as critical to the country's growing space programme, is progressing through key milestones following financial sanction earlier this year.The new facility, referred to as Third Launch Pad (TLP), will serve as the primary site for launching India’s upcoming Next Generation Launch Vehicle (NGLV) and act as a backup for existing heavy-lift vehicles such as LVM3, according to the Department of Space (DoS)The construction timeline includes completion of civil works by May 2028, installation of fluid systems and propellant storage by July 2028, and establishment of launch pad systems by Sept 2028, before full commissioning in March 2029.PollDo you support the development of a third satellite launch pad in India?YesNoAs per DoS, surveys and geotechnical studies were wrapped up by May this year, and tender evaluations for infrastructure works are currently underway. The project is being broken into multiple work packages, with an emphasis on partnering with Indian private players and MSMEs in line with Make in India and self-reliance goals.The need for a third pad has long been flagged by space officials, especially as Isro prepares for human spaceflight under Gaganyaan, continued Moon missions under the Chandrayaan programme, and future operations involving Indian astronauts.Former Isro chairman S Somanath had earlier told TOI that while the second launch pad has been retrofitted for LVM3 and Gaganyaan launches, the risk of a single-point failure remains. “If something happens to the second pad, all heavy launches would grind to a halt,” he had said, batting for TLP.The first launch pad, originally built for the PSLV, is incompatible with cryogenic and semi-cryogenic engines used in newer rockets. The upcoming NGLV, expected to stand 91 metres tall — more than double the height of LVM3 — will also require an entirely new infrastructure due to its significantly higher thrust, new propellant needs, and jet deflection characteristics.Rajarajan A, former director, Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) — the spaceport in Sriharikota — who took charge as director Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) on Aug 1, had earlier stressed on the importance of TLP in accommodating the size and complexity of future rockets.He had told TOI that while existing launch pads are being modified for near-term Gaganyaan missions, only a new pad can fully support India’s next-gen space goals. Once operational, the TLP is expected to become the linchpin of India’s deep space missions, including space station deployment and lunar landings.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous10 Birds with the "wildest dating rituals"LifestyleKarishma Tanna Stuns with Style and SpiritEntertainmentFrom Moong to Chia Sprouts: How to grow your breakfast in balconyLifestyleBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Here’s how much each contestant earns dailytv10 creatures that survive in the deepest parts of the oceanLifestyleRaksha Bandhan: 10 quotes that describe the beautiful bond between brothers and sistersLifestyleHow to do step-by-step Ayurveda hair therapy at homeLifestyleSamantha Ruth Prabhu turns heads in stunning saree looksEntertainmentFrom reducing cholesterol to diabetes : 10 reasons to add cinnamon to your daily dietLifestyleAffordable SUVs under Rs 15 lakh with panoramic sunroof: Tata Nexon, XUV 3XO and moreauto Next123 Photostories  5 diseases moles on your body might indicate and should not be ignoredNot-so popular drinks that help in weightloss10 places in South Africa that aren’t to be missed in a lifetimeMemorable style outings of Princess CharlotteHow Kangana Ranaut turned fame into fearless politicsFrom ₹6 Lakh to ₹40 Lakh: A peek into Kamal Haasan’s ultra-luxe watch closetFrom Archana reacting to a hate comment to son Aaryamann revealing how he impressed girlfriend Yogita Bihani: Archana Puran Singh shares candid moments6 things one should never do when cooking with gheeAugust Escape: Top Hill Stations in Sri Lanka for a Perfect Mountain GetawayYour Lucky Days According To Your Birth Date123Hot PicksGlobal Standard indexUS stocks todayIndia-US tariffIntel CEOMukesh AmbaniUS jobless dataRussia crude oilTop TrendingTom BradyDonald TrumpSouth Park EpisodeCall of DutyMalik BeasleyBattlefield 6 Beta OpensPrivate School in IndianaLuka Doncic Weight LossLinda McMahonLakers RumorsTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire Website'Film not against any religion': Kanhaiya Lal's son watches Udaipur Files with slain tailor's photo - watchEvening news wrap: India's fuel bill may rise by $12bn if it stops buying Russian oil; Centre withdraws Income Tax Bill; and more'Gathering of friendship': China welcomes PM Modi for SCO Tianjin Summit - signal thaw in tiesRahul Gandhi vs EC: Congress MP poses 5 questions day after big 'vote theft' claim; says poll body acting as BJP 'agent'India’s 3rd launch pad In Sriharikota only by March 2029'Big 'kaand' happening under EC's nose': Priyanka Gandhi slams poll body; backs Rahul's claims of voter fraud'Will miss my Hindustan': Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia bids adieu; lauds SC, lawyers in farewell addressWatch: Woman alleges denial of entry over Indian attire; restaurant apologises, Delhi CM orders probeVoter list row intensifies: ECI questions Rahul Gandhi’s ‘fake votes’ claim; cites Karnataka govt’s use of same rolls for caste census'Will advise PM Modi on how to deal with Trump': Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu; claims 'Israeli weapons used in Operation Sindoor'Elon Musk updates Mars mission timeline: Starship crewed by Optimus possible in 2026; real target now 2028–2030Jaz Agassi’s sweet support for dad Andre Agassi — Steffi Graf moment resurfacesUPPSC Staff Nurse result 2025 out at dgme.up.gov.in: Direct link to download scorecards hereWBCAP UG merit list 2025 release delayed: Check important details hereGrads and high schoolers can earn 1-2 lakhs per month through this internship opportunity: Here's howHuma Qureshi's cousin murdered: Chilling visuals from crime scene emerge; Asif was stabbed multiple times by duoHuma Qureshi’s cousin murdered in Delhi over parking dispute; 2 arrestedNavratilova: Chris Evert’s Catholic upbringing shaped her tennis imageSelena Gomez on Swift amid reported split with Blake LivelyDonald Trump Tariffs News Live Updates: India-US trade deal talks in limbo?

This comet, traveling at 130,000 mph, offers a unique opportunity to study material from another star system. Observations reveal a dust plume and tail, similar to solar system comets, suggesting shared characteristics despite its alien origin. Source: NASA NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope In a groundbreaking discovery, has captured the clearest-ever image of 3I/ATLAS, a rare interstellar comet racing through our solar system at an incredible speed of 130,000 miles per hour. Marking only the third confirmed interstellar object ever observed, 3I/ATLAS is offering scientists a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to examine material formed in an entirely different star system, possibly light-years away in the Milky Way galaxy. Unlike typical solar system comets, this cosmic traveller carries with it the secrets of its alien origins, making it an astronomical treasure. Hubble’s sharp observations are now helping researchers unravel its composition, trajectory, and structure — unlocking vital clues about how other planetary systems may evolve across the galaxy.NASA detects interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS showing solar system-like behaviour, Hubble Space Telescope confirmsThe comet was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System), a NASA-funded sky survey designed to detect near-Earth objects. At the time of its discovery, 3I/ATLAS was about 420 million miles from the Sun — far from Earth and posing no danger. However, what makes this event so extraordinary is its origin: 3I/ATLAS is not from our solar system.Its hyperbolic trajectory and high velocity confirm it’s a visitor from another star system, making it only the third interstellar object ever observed after ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Using its ultra-precise optics, the Hubble Space Telescope revealed a sunlit dust plume emerging from 3I/ATLAS and the early formation of a dust tail, similar to that seen in typical solar system comets. This glowing halo, or coma, surrounds the comet’s solid core and gives scientists clues about its composition and behavior.Though the actual nucleus — the frozen core of ice and rock — is still hidden beneath the coma and invisible even to Hubble, astronomers estimate its size to be between 1,000 feet (320 meters) and 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers) in diameter.Interestingly, the comet’s dust-loss rate — a key indicator of activity — appears comparable to that of native solar system comets located roughly 300 million miles from the Sun. This suggests that while 3I/ATLAS comes from another solar system, it behaves much like our own cometary bodies, pointing to potentially shared physical characteristics.Mysterious origins of 3I/ATLASAccording to NASA, 3I/ATLAS likely originated in a different solar system, possibly billions of years ago. It may have been ejected by gravitational forces during the early formation of a distant planetary system and has since drifted through interstellar space, influenced by countless gravitational encounters with stars and nebulae.“It’s like glimpsing a rifle bullet for a thousandth of a second,” said Dr. David Jewitt, lead astronomer for the Hubble observations and planetary scientist at UCLA. “You can’t trace it back precisely to where it came from.”While its exact origin remains unknown, its discovery is part of a growing body of evidence suggesting there may be a hidden population of interstellar objects silently passing through our solar neighborhood — most undetected until now.NASA: 3I/ATLAS reveals hidden population of interstellar comets“This latest interstellar tourist is one of a previously undetected population of objects bursting onto the scene,” Jewitt explained. “We’ve now crossed a threshold in detection capability, thanks to next-generation sky surveys.”In fact, today’s advanced telescopes and space observatories — such as Hubble, James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), TESS, Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, and Hawaii’s W.M. Keck Observatory — are revolutionizing our ability to detect and study fast-moving interstellar bodies. Each plays a crucial role in capturing critical data on their trajectories, chemical composition, and physical behavior.The ongoing observation of 3I/ATLAS by this array of instruments will allow scientists to analyze its gases, dust particles, and molecular structure, giving us a deeper understanding of how comets evolve in alien star systems.3I/ATLAS timeline: Visibility and future observationsFor space enthusiasts and astronomers alike, 3I/ATLAS will continue to be visible through ground-based telescopes until September 2025. After this, the comet will pass too close to the Sun and become temporarily obscured by solar glare. However, it’s expected to re-emerge in early December 2025, offering another exciting chance to study this interstellar object in motion. Scientists are eager to analyze its composition and trajectory to better understand objects from beyond our solar system.Why 3I/ATLAS matters: Scientific and philosophical implicationsWhile 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, its significance cannot be overstated. Studying it may help scientists answer some of the most profound questions in astrophysics:How common are interstellar objects in our galaxy?Do other planetary systems produce comets like our own?Can we use these objects as natural probes into the chemistry of distant star systems?Each interstellar discovery pushes the boundary of what we know about the structure and evolution of the Milky Way, and potentially, about the conditions that lead to planetary formation and life.Also Read | NASA warns!

Wombat poop is cube-shaped. Octopuses possess multiple hearts and brains. Even spiders have journeyed to space.  You know that feeling when someone tells you something so wild, so ridiculously unexpected, that you have to double-check if it’s actually true? That’s this list. These aren’t TikTok myths or clickbait fluff, these are legit, research-backed science facts that feel like the universe is pranking us. Weird but 100% real: From radioactive bananas to space-faring spiders, explore the strange side of science that sounds like fiction but is surprisingly true. So get ready to rethink everything you know about life, space, your body and even bananas. Yep, bananas.15 weird science facts that seem fake but are realBananas are slightly radioactiveBecause they contain potassium-40, a naturally occurring isotope, bananas give off small amounts of radiation. You’d need to eat millions to feel the effects but it’s still wild that your breakfast is glowing, scientifically speaking.Your stomach digests itself every few daysIf it didn’t replace its lining regularly, your stomach’s acid would start digesting you. That’s why it sheds and regenerates the mucosal lining every 3–4 days. Your stomach is basically a self-cleaning oven.There are more trees on Earth than stars in the Milky WayNASA estimates there are 100–400 billion stars in the Milky Way. But Earth? Over 3 trillion trees. Forests are winning the numbers game (for now).A teaspoon of neutron star weighs more than Mount EverestNeutron stars are the collapsed cores of massive stars. Just one teaspoon of that ultra-dense matter would weigh about 6 billion tons. That’s heavier than all the cars, people, and animals on Earth combined.You can survive in space, for about 15 secondsWithout a suit, you won’t explode. But you will lose consciousness in seconds due to lack of oxygen. Your body starts to swell and freeze, not exactly a fun way to go, but not instant either.Wombat poop is cube-shapedYes, cubes. Wombats evolved to produce cube-shaped droppings that don’t roll away, helpful for marking territory. It's an engineering marvel inside an animal.Octopuses have 3 hearts and 9 brainsOne brain controls the nervous system, and each arm has a mini-brain. Two hearts pump blood to the gills, one to the body. Basically, they’re the multi-core processors of the ocean.Your body glows but only in total darknessHumans naturally emit a very faint glow due to biochemical reactions. It’s about 1,000 times weaker than what our eyes can detect, but it’s real and visible to ultra-sensitive cameras.Sharks existed before treesSharks have been around for 400 million years. Trees came 50 million years later. So technically, a shark could throw shade at a tree for being the new guy.There’s a species of jellyfish that’s biologically immortalThe Turritopsis dohrnii can revert to its juvenile stage after maturity, basically hitting reset on aging. It doesn’t have to die of old age. Jealous yet?Spiders have been to space and survivedNASA sent spiders into orbit to study how they spin webs in zero gravity. Fun fact: their webs were messier in space, but they adapted fast. Astronauts said their behavior changed depending on light direction.Sloths can hold their breath longer than dolphinsDolphins: 10 minutes. Sloths: 40 minutes. They slow their heart rate and chill so hard they could win a breath-holding contest underwater.Hot water can freeze faster than coldIt’s called the Mpemba effect. Under the right conditions, hot water can freeze more quickly than cold. Scientists are still debating exactly why, but it’s not a myth.Lightning is five times hotter than the sun’s surfaceA bolt of lightning can reach 30,000°C (54,000°F). That’s about five times hotter than the surface of the sun. Next time you see a storm, just remember you're watching a plasma torch in the sky.Your DNA could stretch to Pluto and backIf you unraveled all the DNA in your body’s 37 trillion cells, it could stretch over 10 billion miles. That’s enough to reach Pluto and return. Multiple times.Science isn’t just about lab coats and beakers, it’s full of strange, mind-bending facts that make life feel like sci-fi. So the next time someone says, “You won’t believe this,” maybe you should.

Using its Mastcam-Z, the rover revealed ancient terrain features and an enhanced-color view with a surreal blue sky. The images aid research into Mars’ history and support future human exploration.  NASA’s Perseverance rover has captured its most detailed and vivid panorama of the Martian landscape to date. Taken on May 26, 2025, at a location known as “Falbreen,” the image is a 360-degree mosaic stitched from 96 high-resolution photos. Enhanced in color, the stunning panorama features unusually clear skies and an optical illusion of blue, adding a surreal twist to the red planet’s traditionally dusty appearance. This milestone in visual clarity showcases the power of Perseverance’s imaging tools and offers scientists a sharper look at the ancient geology surrounding Jezero Crater.NASA’s Mars team strikes gold at FalbreenFalbreen, the location of the panorama, is situated near the top of Jezero Crater’s rim, one of Mars’ most geologically rich areas. The imaging team took advantage of a rare stretch of dust-free weather to capture details from rock textures to distant hills over 40 miles away. The site includes sand ripples, boundary lines between ancient terrains, and a mysterious “float rock” that may have been transported by natural forces long ago.While the Martian sky is typically reddish due to fine dust particles, this panorama's enhanced-color version shows it in a deceptive blue hue. In reality, the clear skies were ideal for imaging, and color enhancement was used to accentuate contrast and geological differences, making features stand out more vividly for scientific analysis.Precision from PerseveranceThe Mastcam-Z instrument, mounted on the rover’s mast, captured the images on Sol 1516 (Martian day), providing researchers with unparalleled clarity. At the center-left of the mosaic is an abrasion patch, Perseverance’s 43rd rock abrasion, used to expose the interior of a rock for further analysis. The rover’s robotic tools allow scientists to investigate the mineral makeup before drilling and collecting core samples.Falbreen’s terrain may be among the oldest Perseverance has explored. With its distinct contact zone between olivine-rich and clay-bearing rocks, the area could hold crucial clues about Mars’ geological past and potentially its habitability. Some of these rocks may date back billions of years, formed when liquid water still flowed across the planet’s surface. The contrasting mineral zones also hint at long-lost environmental shifts, possibly marking the transition from a wetter to a colder, drier Mars. By combining visual, chemical, and contextual data, researchers aim to deepen our understanding of Mars’ formation and evolution.NASA’s Mars program continues to push boundaries, with Perseverance laying the groundwork for future human exploration. As acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy said, “Vistas like that of Falbreen are just a glimpse of what we’ll soon witness with our own eyes.” The mission, part of NASA’s broader Artemis to Mars roadmap, underscores humanity’s bold steps toward putting boots on the Martian surface in the decades ahead.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

The mission, initially planned as a weeklong stay, stretched to more than nine months due to technical issues with the spacecraft. Starliner eventually returned to Earth without its crew, while Wilmore and Williams came back in March aboard a SpaceX capsule.A retired Navy captain, Wilmore was selected as a Nasa astronaut in 2000 and flew on three space missions, logging 464 days in orbit. His most recent mission accounted for nearly two-thirds of that time, totaling 286 days.Williams, 59, remains with Nasa and recently joined second lady Usha Vance at Johnson Space Center in Houston for a children’s summer reading challenge.“Throughout his career, Butch has exemplified the technical excellence of what is required of an astronaut,” said Nasa chief astronaut Joe Acaba. “As he steps into this new chapter, that same dedication will no doubt continue to show in whatever he decides to do next.”About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

While posing no immediate collision risk, their sizes—300 and 200 feet respectively—and speeds have garnered attention. NASA's continuous monitoring ensures public safety through timely updates and precise orbital calculations.  NASA has issued an important alert about two large asteroids set to pass close to Earth on Friday, August 8, 2025. While there is no immediate danger, the significant size, high speed, and timing of these space rocks have drawn widespread attention from astronomers, scientists, and the public. The first asteroid, (2025 OJ1), measures approximately 300 feet wide—about the height of a 30-story building—and will pass at a distance of around 3.2 million miles. The second, (2019 CO1), roughly 200 feet wide, will fly by at about 4.24 million miles. NASA’s advanced monitoring systems continuously track such near-Earth objects, ensuring timely updates. These close approaches highlight the importance of ongoing vigilance in planetary defense and space observation. Experts emphasize that understanding asteroid trajectories aids future impact prevention strategies and international cooperation for Earth's safety.NASA issues urgent warning on two massive asteroids approaching Earth on August 8, 2025Asteroid (2025 OJ1): Size, speed, and distance revealedThe first asteroid, officially designated (2025 OJ1), is approximately 300 feet (about 91 meters) in diameter—roughly equivalent to the height of a 30-story building. This considerable size makes it one of the larger space rocks observed in recent years.According to NASA’s Near-Earth Object tracking system, (2025 OJ1) will pass Earth at a distance of approximately 3.2 million miles (5.15 million kilometers). While this distance is vast by everyday standards, it is considered a close approach in astronomical terms. To put this in perspective, the average distance between Earth and the Moon is about 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers), so (2025 OJ1) will pass about 13 times farther than the Moon.Traveling at an extremely high velocity, this asteroid will briefly be visible to powerful telescopes and tracking systems as it speeds through near-Earth space. Its size and proximity make it an object of interest for astronomers studying asteroid compositions, orbital mechanics, and potential impact ascenarios.Asteroid (2019 CO1) : Size, speed and orbital detailsOn the very same day, NASA will observe another significant asteroid, (2019 CO1), estimated to be about 200 feet (approximately 61 meters) in diameter. This size is comparable to that of a large commercial airplane, underscoring the considerable mass of this space object.(2019 CO1) will pass Earth at a distance of roughly 4.24 million miles (6.82 million kilometers), which is farther than (2025 OJ1) but still within the category of a close celestial approach. Despite being smaller, the asteroid’s high speed and trajectory make it an important target for continuous observation.The simultaneous close passes of these two asteroids highlight the dynamic environment of near-Earth space and remind us that the solar system is home to countless objects of various sizes moving at incredible speeds.No risk of collision for Earth; NASA confirmsNASA has been quick to reassure the public that neither (2025 OJ1) nor (2019 CO1) poses any collision threat to Earth during their 2025 flybys. Based on precise orbital calculations and tracking data, scientists confirm that both asteroids will safely pass by without entering Earth’s atmosphere or causing any harm.It is important to understand that close approaches by asteroids happen regularly as part of the natural movement of objects within our solar system. NASA’s advanced technology and early warning systems enable accurate predictions and timely updates, ensuring that potentially hazardous situations are identified well in advance.What are near-Earth objects (NEOs) and why do they matterNear-Earth Objects (NEOs) are comets or asteroids that have orbits bringing them into close proximity with Earth. Because some of these objects can potentially collide with our planet, NASA and other space agencies worldwide actively track and study them. NEOs vary widely in size—from small meteoroids to massive asteroids spanning hundreds of feet in diameter.Monitoring NEOs is crucial for planetary defense because early detection of potentially hazardous objects allows for preparation, possible deflection missions, or evacuation plans if necessary. The two asteroids approaching on August 8, 2025, fall under this category of closely monitored NEOs.How you can stay updated on near-Earth asteroid eventsNASA provides public access to information on near-Earth asteroids through several platforms:The Near-Earth Object Web Portal, where users can track upcoming asteroid flybysSocial media updates from NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination OfficeLive streams and news releases during notable asteroid approachesFor those interested in astronomy, many organizations and amateur astronomer groups also share observational tips and updates during asteroid flybys.NASA’s ongoing vigilance safeguards Earth from asteroid threatsOn August 8, 2025, the close approach of two large asteroids, (2025 OJ1) and (2019 CO1), reminds us of the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of near-Earth space. Despite their massive size and high speed, both will pass safely millions of miles away, presenting no immediate threat to our planet.Thanks to NASA’s continuous monitoring, advanced technology, and the dedicated work of the Planetary Defense Coordination Office, Earth remains well-protected from potential asteroid hazards. These events emphasise the importance of sustained investment in space observation and planetary defense initiatives as humanity looks toward a safer future in space.Also Read | Perseid meteor shower 2025 to peak on August 12–13: When and where to watch the dazzling fireball displayAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Dinosaurs with weaponised skulls: New study uncovers how predator heads evolved into killing machines
A recent study reveals that theropod dinosaurs evolved specialized skulls for distinct attack styles. Tyrannosaurus rex possessed bone-crushing skulls, while spinosaurs developed narrow snouts for slicing flesh. These adaptations provided a competitive edge, allowing different theropods to coexist by targeting various prey. This weaponization of skulls highlights the diverse predatory strategies and evolutionary pressures shaping these prehistoric giants.

Tyrannosaurus rex possessed bone-crushing skulls, while spinosaurs developed narrow snouts for slicing flesh. These adaptations provided a competitive edge, allowing different theropods to coexist by targeting various prey. This weaponization of skulls highlights the diverse predatory strategies and evolutionary pressures shaping these prehistoric giants.  Giant dinosaurs weren’t terrifying just because of their size or teeth. According to a new study published in the Anatomical Record, their skulls were evolutionary tools of destruction, custom-built for killing, not just chewing. Researchers analysed the skull structure of 18 different theropod species from the bone-crushing Tyrannosaurus rex to the long-snouted, crocodile-like spinosaurids. What they found was a striking pattern: these predators didn’t evolve one-size-fits-all jaws. Instead, their skulls were tailored for specific attack styles. The T. rex had a short, thick skull ideal for delivering bone-shattering bites, like a biological sledgehammer. In contrast, dinosaurs like allosaurs and spinosaurs developed narrow, blade-like snouts that allowed for rapid, slicing strikes, perfect for targeting softer flesh with precision. These adaptations weren’t random. They were survival strategies, shaped by millions of years of evolution. The study highlights how these massive creatures weaponised their own skulls, turning their heads into killing machines that reflected their hunting style and place in the food chain. Whether through brute force or surgical finesse, these dinosaurs ruled their world and their skulls were the secret to their dominance.How dinosaur skulls became weapons: Not all bites were created equalThe study revealed that the Tyrannosaurus rex possessed one of the most powerful bites in the history of life on Earth. Its short, deep, and heavily built skull was reinforced like a shock-absorbing machine, allowing it to crush bones with the force of a living sledgehammer. This bone-shattering bite meant that T. rex didn’t just kill its prey, it devoured every part of it, bones and all, leaving little behind. In sharp contrast, spinosaurs and allosaur-like theropods evolved lighter, narrower skulls designed not for brute force but for precision.Their heads functioned more like surgical blades than bludgeons, ideal for slicing through soft flesh with speed and efficiency. These predators likely struck quickly, focusing on agile hunting techniques rather than raw power.This striking difference in skull mechanics reveals the wide spectrum of predatory strategies among dinosaurs, from bone-crushing tanks like T. rex to sleek, slicing assassins like spinosaurs. It’s a fascinating glimpse into how evolution shaped their heads into deadly weapons, each built for a different style of domination.Skull weapons gave dinosaurs a competitive edge in prehistoric ecosystemsWhy did these skull adaptations matter? Because evolution is a battlefield. Dinosaurs that evolved specialised skulls could fill unique ecological niches. Bone crushers like T. rex may have targeted larger prey or scavenged, while slicing predators likely hunted fast-moving animals or fished.This diversity allowed many types of theropods with weaponised skulls to coexist without direct competition. It also shows how nature doesn’t always reward brute strength, sometimes, speed and accuracy win the fight. The weaponisation of dinosaur skulls was less about size and more about strategy.Dinosaurs with skull weapons weren’t all the same: A case of convergent evolutionInterestingly, these skull traits evolved independently in different dinosaur families. That means similar weaponised features, like reinforced jaws or blade-like snouts showed up in unrelated lineages, a phenomenon known as convergent evolution. This reinforces how effective these adaptations were across millions of years. Whether it was a T. rex cracking bones or a spinosaur shearing flesh, each strategy worked because it suited that dinosaur’s prey, environment, and hunting style. The evolution of dinosaur skulls into weapons tells us not just about their bodies but about the world they lived in.Why dinosaur skull weapons still fascinate us todayThere’s something endlessly gripping about the idea that dinosaurs used their skulls not just to house their brains but as powerful, built-in weapons. It changes the way we see them. They weren’t just lumbering, mindless beasts. They were evolutionary specialists, honed over millions of years for survival and supremacy. Some, like the T. rex, were bone-crushing tanks, brute-force fighters whose heads functioned like biological wrecking balls. Others, like spinosaurs and allosaurs, were precision predators, using narrow, blade-like skulls to slice through flesh with eerie efficiency. Each skull tells a story of strategy of how these creatures hunted, fought, and thrived in prehistoric ecosystems that were as competitive as they were deadly.What continues to fascinate us is the diversity of these head-based weapons. From club-like jaws to knife-edged snouts, nature experimented boldly. And in that, we see a deeper truth: evolution’s deadliest designs aren’t always the biggest or loudest. They’re the ones sharpened by need, adapted to perfection and often hiding in plain sight.Also read| 235 Students reach final round of NASA-ISRO educational tourAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Momentum sagging at UN plastic pollution treaty talks
Talks on forging a landmark treaty to combat the scourge of plastic pollution were stumbling Saturday, with progress slow and countries wildly at odds on how far the proposed agreement should go. The talks are mandated to look at the full life cycle of plastic, from production to pollution, but some countries are unhappy with such a wide scope.

The talks are mandated to look at the full life cycle of plastic, from production to pollution, but some countries are unhappy with such a wide scope. Representative image GENEVA: Talks on forging a landmark treaty to combat the scourge of plastic pollution were stumbling Saturday, with progress slow and countries wildly at odds on how far the proposed agreement should go.The negotiations, which opened on Tuesday, have four working days left to strike a legally-binding instrument that would tackle the growing problem choking the environment.In a blunt mid-way assessment, talks chair Luis Vayas Valdivieso warned the 184 countries negotiating at the United Nations that they had to get shifting to get a deal."Progress made has not been sufficient," Vayas told delegates."A real push to achieve our common goal is needed," the Ecuadoran diplomat said, adding that Thursday was not a just deadline but "a date by which we must deliver."Some articles still have unresolved issues and show little progress towards reaching a common understanding," Vayas lamented.The key fracture is between countries that want to focus on waste management and others who want a more ambitious treaty that also cuts production and eliminates use of the most toxic chemicals.And with the talks relying on finding consensus, it has become a game of brinkmanship.A diplomatic source told reporters that many informal meetings had been scrambled together for Sunday's day off to try and break the deadlock."If nothing changes, we won't get there," the source added.Battle of the bracketsCountries have reconvened in Geneva after the failure of the supposedly fifth and final round of negotiations in Busan, South Korea in 2024.After four days of talks, the draft text has ballooned from 22 to 35 pages -- with the number of brackets in the text going up near five-fold to almost 1,500 as countries insert a blizzard of conflicting wishes and ideas.The talks are mandated to look at the full life cycle of plastic, from production to pollution, but some countries are unhappy with such a wide scope.Kuwait spoke up for the so-called Like-Minded Group -- a nebulous cluster of mostly oil-producing nations which rejects production limits and wants to focus on treating waste."Let us agree on what we can agree. Consensus must be the basis of all our decisions," Kuwait insisted.Nudging in the same direction, Saudi Arabia, speaking for the Arab Group, said the responsible way ahead was to start considering what bits of the text "may not make it to the final outcome due to irreconcilable divergence".But given how little is truly agreed on, Uruguay warned that consensus "cannot be used as a justification to not achieve our objectives".Eirik Lindebjerg, global plastics adviser for the World Wide Fund for Nature, told AFP that the Like-Minded Group's proposal was "another attempt to make it a waste management agreement", and to stifle talks on reducing the amount of plastic in circulation.Path through the fogThe UN Environment Programme is hosting the talks and swiftly called a press conference after the stock-take session.UNEP executive director Inger Andersen said a deal was "really within our grasp, even though today it might not look so"."Despite the fog of negotiations I'm really encouraged," she told reporters, insisting: "There is a pathway to success."Vayas added: "We need to accelerate. We need a better rhythm in this and we need to also work in such a way that it will be clear that we will deliver by the end."Afterwards, Bjorn Beeler, executive director at IPEN, a global network aimed at limiting toxic chemicals, told AFP: "This whole process has not been able to take decisions and is still collecting ideas. We're sleepwalking towards a cliff and if we don't wake up, we're falling off."'Profits from poisoning'Plastic pollution is so ubiquitous that microplastics have been found on the highest mountain peaks, in the deepest ocean trench and scattered throughout almost every part of the human body.More than 400 million tonnes of plastic are produced globally each year, half of which is for single-use items.Plastic production is set to triple by 2060.Panama's negotiator Juan Monterrey Gomez took the floor to slam those countries wanting to stop the treaty from encompassing the entire life cycle of plastic.He said microplastics "are in our blood, in our lungs and in the first cry of a new-born child. Our bodies are living proof of a system that profits from poisoning us". "We cannot recycle our way out of this crisis."End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksGlobal Standard indexUS stocks todayIndia-US tariffIntel CEOMukesh AmbaniUS jobless dataRussia crude oilTop TrendingTyreek HillSelena GomezKim KardashianTaylor SwiftTravis KelceBill Belichicks GirlfriendNBA Trade RumorsDwyane WadesShannon SharpeMike VrabelTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteTyreek Hill, ex Keeta Vaccaro rush baby Capri to ER;

Silopi, a city in the Sirnak province, is located around 10 kilometres from the Iraq and Syrian borders. It shattered the previous national high of 49.5 C recorded in August 2023 in the western province of Eskisehir. Turkey has faced weeks of scorching heat along with several wildfires. Fourteen people lost their lives battling blazes last month in the western part of the country. Hundreds of people were evacuated on Friday in the northwest province of Canakkale, where the busy Dardanelles Strait was closed to maritime traffic due to two raging fires. The heatwave has also prompted fears of water shortages in some areas.

Representative image (Image: AP) LAGRASSE: A wildfire in southern France slowed overnight into Wednesday after injuring nine people and burning through 11,000 hectares of vegetation, local officials said. The blaze, which started on Tuesday afternoon, is still threatening several villages in the aude department, where 1,500 firefighters have been battling to extinguish it."The fire is advancing in an area where all the conditions are ripe for it to progress. We are monitoring the edges and the back of the fire to prevent flare-ups," said Lucie Roesch, secretary general of the qude prefecture.She said firefighters are expecting to receive aerial support at dawn, but warned "this fire will keep us busy for several days. It's a long-term operation".The fire's advance slowed overnight due to high humidity levels, she added.One person was seriously burned and another injured, the prefecture said, adding that seven firefighters were also hurt. Camping grounds and one village were partially evacuated, and several local roads have been closed."All of the Nation's resources are mobilised," French president Emmanuel Macron said on X, while calling on people to exercise "the utmost caution".The qude department has seen an increase in areas burnt in recent years, aggravated by low rainfall and the removal of vineyards, which used to help break the progression of fires.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous10 beautiful and low-maintenance fishes for home aquariumsLifestyleKelley Mack: A look into the actress's most popular worksEntertainmentMalvi Malhotra redefines chic in THESE picsEntertainmentVitamins in broccoli: A, C, K, and more in one powerful veggieLifestyleJenna Ortega’s Wednesday promo looks redefine gothic glamourEntertainmentMegha Chakraborty’s Bubbly Fashion GametvKajal Raghwani blends tradition with charm in every graceful ethnic momentEntertainmentReduce dementia risk: 10 lifestyle changes that can protect your brainLifestyleUnmissable entry looks of Bigg Boss Malayalam 7 contestantstvPeshwai nath to Nathuli: Trendy hoop naths that deserve a place in your vanity boxLifestyle Next123 Photostories  The secret of Lingaraj: A temple where two gods dwell as oneBeyond Gangtok: 5 hill stations in Sikkim that redefine peace and serenity5 Foods that can work like natural laxatives and fix constipationUntold stories from Jaya Prada’s life and legacy7 smart ways for couples to split financesExploring wild side of Goa: 5 wildlife sanctuaries that are a treat to the senses6 Surprising Animals That Don’t Have Bones in Their BodiesThe best exercises to get rid of cellulite5 saree colours Rekha wears on repeat!What happens when you eat 2 apples a day and 5 simple breakfast recipes to try123Hot PicksRBI MPC MeetPatna Double Decker BridgeSpiceJetRBI MPC MeetRussia OilUS China TradeNSDL IPO allotmentTop TrendingTrinity RodmanDe'Aaron FoxConnor BedardDennis RodmanRussell WilsonMitch MarnersKirby DachMatthew TkachukConnor McDavidAdam RuzickaTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteBird slams into plane nose: Cabin filled with smoke mid-air; panic on Paris-bound flight — watchBaby bonus: China offers subsidy to boost birth rate; why 'lie flat' gen isn't convinced‘Remains hopeful’: Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs’ lawyer seeks Trump’s pardon; Combs to remain jailed till sentencing'I am going to exert my powers': Prosecute minors as adults?

AI image ALGIERS: At a beach near Algiers, brown algae native to the Pacific Ocean cover the golden sand, posing a threat to ecosystems native to the area and their stench repelling swimmers at the peak of summer.Following a recent government call to help clear beaches swarmed by the seaweed species known scientifically as Rugulopteryx okamurae, several volunteers and charities have stepped in."When it washes up, we can't swim," said Salim Hemmedi, a 43-year-old vacationer at a beach in Sidi Fredj, where volunteers raked up heaps of the plant."We hope the situation will improve so that we can enjoy ourselves... and that children can swim in peace."The alga originates from temperate waters around Japan and the Korean peninsula in the northwest Pacific Ocean.It was first spotted in Algeria in late 2023, according to Lamia Bahbah, a lecturer and researcher at the National School of Marine Sciences and Coastal Planning.And lately, some have noted that it has been increasingly washed ashore.Youcef Segni, a marine engineer and biologist, said the algae proliferated at a significantly higher rate than in 2023 and 2024."They invade the habitats of other algae in the seabed, which leads to the disappearance of some species," he said, adding that it can also displace some native fish.Fast reproductionIn France, Spain and Portugal, the Rugulopteryx okamurae species has also been observed.Earlier this year, Spanish football club Real Betis introduced kits repurposed from seaweed to raise awareness about the issue.A 2023 study by the Marine Drugs journal said the alga's invasive character led to "a replacement of the native biota and an occupancy rate that reached almost 100 per cent in some locations" in Portugal.In Algeria, the plant has been spotted in at least three of the country's 14 coastal provinces, including the capital where 16 beaches are affected, authorities said."Are the waters suitable for swimming? Yes," said Environment Minister Nadjiba Djilali during the cleanup campaign, adding there were no records of the plant causing allergies.Researcher Bahbah said stopping its proliferation was "unfortunately impossible at this stage".She said the plant reproduces at a high rate, both sexually and asexually.The species can reproduce through fragmentation, meaning new individual algae can develop from fragmented pieces of other Rugulopteryx okamurae algae.The algae spread mainly by clinging to the hulls of boats, and the Mediterranean's moderate temperature favours the seaweed's fast reproduction."We are going to fight it," said Fella Zaboudj, a state engineer in marine sciences, adding that researchers were monitoring its spread, development and evolution.Zaboudj said research was also underway to determine whether the algae could be repurposed as fertiliser.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksSibu SorenPatna Double Decker BridgeSpiceJetRBI MPC MeetRussia OilUS China TradeNSDL IPO allotmentTop TrendingTrinity RodmanDe'Aaron FoxConnor BedardDennis RodmanRussell WilsonMitch MarnersKirby DachMatthew TkachukConnor McDavidAdam RuzickaTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website'Will raise tariff substantially in 24 hours': Donald Trump fires fresh salvo;

Ireland's wind energy sector has long been touted as full of potential. AI image BANGOR: On Ireland's blustery western seaboard, researchers are gleefully flying giant kites, not for fun but in the hope of generating renewable electricity and sparking a "revolution" in wind energy."We use a kite to capture the wind and a generator at the bottom of it that captures the power," Padraic Doherty of Kitepower, the Dutch firm behind the venture, told AFP. At its test site in operation since September 2023 near the small town of Bangor Erris, the team transports the vast 60-square-metre (645,000-square-feet) kite from a hangar across the lunar-like bogland to a generator. The kite is then attached by a cable tether to the machine and acts like a "yo-yo or fishing reel", Doherty said."It gets cast out and flies up, the tether pulls it back in, over and over again, creating energy," he said, testing the kite's ropes and pulleys before a flight.The sparsely populated spot near the stormy Atlantic coast is the world's first designated airborne renewable energy test site. And although the idea is still small in scale, it could yet prove to be a mighty plan as Ireland seeks to cut its reliance on fossil fuels such as oil and gas."We are witnessing a revolution in wind energy," said Andrei Luca, operations head at Kitepower, a zero-emissions energy solutions spin-off from the Delft University of Technology."It took nearly 25 years for wind turbines to evolve from 30-kilowatt prototypes to megawatt scale, and decades to offshore wind farms we see today," he added.The system flies autonomously, driven by software developed at the university in the Netherlands, but Doherty acts as the kite's "pilot" on the ground, monitoring its flight path for efficiency. The kite flies up around 400 metres (1,300 feet) and reels in to about 190 metres, generating around 30 kilowatts for storage.The force spins "like a dynamo on a bike", Doherty said, adding that "it generates up to two and a half tonnes of force through each turn".The electricity is stored in batteries, similar to solar photovoltaic systems, with the kite currently able to fully charge a 336-kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery."That's a meaningful amount of energy, sufficient for powering a remote outpost, a small island, polar station, or even a construction site," Luca said."Add additional kites and we can power a bigger island."'Mobile, flexible'According to Doherty, a chief advantage of the kite system is its flexibility and swift start-up capability."We can set up in 24 hours and can bring it anywhere, it's super mobile, and doesn't need expensive, time- and energy-consuming turbine foundations to be built," he said. A kite system is "way less invasive on the landscape (than wind turbines), produces clean energy and doesn't need a supply chain of fuel to keep running", Luca added.During January's Storm Eowyn, which caused widespread and long-lasting power outages in Ireland, the system showed its value in Bangor Erris, according to Luca. "Paired with a battery, it provided uninterrupted electricity before, during and after the storm," he said. Ireland's wind energy sector has long been touted as full of potential.But progress on large-scale delivery of onshore and offshore turbines has been held up by planning delays and electricity grid capacity constraints.The Irish government has set ambitious targets for offshore wind energy to deliver 20 gigawatts of energy by 2040 and at least 37 gigawatts by 2050.In 2024, Irish wind farms provided around a third of the country's electricity according to Wind Energy Ireland (WEI), a lobby group for the sector. This compares to the UK, where, according to trade association RenewableUK, wind energy from the country's combined wind farms first reached 20 gigawatts in November 2022.The ability of airborne wind energy (AWE) systems to harness high-altitude winds with relatively low infrastructure requirements "makes them particularly suitable for remote, offshore or mobile applications," Mahdi Salari, an AWE researcher at University College Cork, told AFP.But he said Kitepower would face challenges on "regulation, safety, and system reliability". Such technology however could plug gaps in places where "land availability, costs or logistical constraints hinder the deployment of traditional wind turbines", Salari said.By the 2030s, he said: "I expect AWE to contribute meaningfully to diversified, flexible and distributed renewable energy networks".Discover stories of India’s leading eco-innovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksSibu SorenPatna Double Decker BridgeSpiceJetGold Price PredectionRussia OilUS China TradeNSDL IPO allotmentTop TrendingRussell WilsonHailee SteinfeldsF1 StandingsDez BryantLebron James WifeRussia Oil ImportsTriple HPrince HarryRJ MahvashAntonio BrownTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteBrooke Hogan’s husband: Hulk Hogan showed no interest in meeting grandkidsDak Prescott builds new mansion, reveals why he razed the last oneTaylor Swift’s Kelce jacket inspires Kristin Juszczyk’s new NFL lineGabrielle Union on menopause: 'It makes it hard' — motherhood now more emotional, exhaustingGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai to employees: ‘I think we have to....'Apple CEO Tim Cook confirms: Majority of new iPhones sold in the US are 'made' in India;

'Nothing goes to waste': Denmark zoo asks people to donate their pets to feed its predators; assures animals will be 'gently euthanized'
Aalborg Zoo in Denmark is now accepting unwanted small pets as donations to feed its predators. The zoo assures that donated animals like rabbits and guinea pigs will be humanely euthanized before being used as food. This initiative aims to mimic the natural food chain, promoting animal welfare and natural behaviour among captive carnivores.

(Ai generated image)  If you have a pet you can no longer keep, one zoo in Denmark is offering an unusual option.Aalborg Zoo is asking the public to donate small pets — not for rehoming, but to be used as food for its captive predators.Aalborg Zoo, located in northern Denmark, said in a Facebook post that the move is meant to mimic the natural food chain of animals housed there. The zoo says this effort supports “animal welfare and professional integrity,” and assures that any donated pets will be “gently euthanized” by trained staff.“If you have a healthy animal that needs to be given away for various reasons, feel free to donate it to us,” the post said.The zoo lists rabbits, guinea pigs, horses and chickens as examples of suitable donations.PollWhat do you think about Aalborg Zoo's practice of accepting pets for food for predators?Support it for animal welfareOppose it, find other solutionsOnce euthanised, the animals will be used as fodder for the zoo’s carnivores.“That way, nothing goes to waste — and we ensure natural behaviour, nutrition and well-being of our predators,” the zoo claimed.The post is accompanied by a picture of a wildcat showing its teeth with its mouth wide open. It also includes a link to the zoo’s website.About the zoo Aalborg Zoo was founded in April 1935. The facility is located near the centre of Aalborg and spans 8 hectares. It houses more than 1,500 animals across 126 species and draws hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.According to the zoo’s official website, Aalborg Zoo focuses on conservation, sustainability and education.It takes part in international breeding programmes for endangered species and supports global efforts in animal conservation, research and fair trade.

Pedestrians were seen wading through flooded roads with extreme caution, fearing open manholes, uncovered drains, and the threat of electric shocks from submerged wires and poles.PollWhat do you think is the biggest issue causing urban flooding during monsoon?Poor drainage systemsLack of planning and maintenanceMeanwhile, the India Meteorological Department has predicted heavy rainfall in the region over the next few days.Moreover, contaminated water triggered a diarrhea outbreak in Bihar's Jehanabad.

House razings to save Niger capital's forest shield dismay locals
Hamissou Issiakou grumbled as he worked to strip bare his house, marked for demolition for illegally encroaching on the tip of green forest that's keeping the expanding desert at bay from Niger's capital. Director General of Water and Forests within the environment ministry Yacouba Seybou said on state television that since 2004 "decrees have prohibited housing in the (green) belt".

Director General of Water and Forests within the environment ministry Yacouba Seybou said on state television that since 2004 "decrees have prohibited housing in the (green) belt". Representative image (AFP) NIAMEY: Hamissou Issiakou grumbled as he worked to strip bare his house, marked for demolition for illegally encroaching on the tip of green forest that's keeping the expanding desert at bay from Niger's capital.His is one of nearly 500 homes being bulldozed as the authorities in the arid desert country, which is particularly at risk from man-made global warming, seek to shore up the wooded belt around Niamey's outskirts.Ukraine Launches MASSIVE Drone Attack On Russia; 3 Killed, Over 100 UAVs Shot Down"We've bought our plots of land at great expense. In the end it's a big waste," Issiakou told AFP, after urging workers to hurry up and remove an enormous gate before the police arrive. Since the heavy machinery began rolling in at the end of June, dozens of slums, luxury houses and apartment blocks have tumbled like a house of cards.Some homeowners have just stood by and watched in dismay as the bulldozers tore down their houses. Others, like Issiakou, have rushed to remove anything of value before the two-week notice period was up, from windows, metal sheets and electrical cables to small drinking water tanks and surveillance cameras.All say they bought their land from private real-estate agencies. - 'Submit to Allah' -In a country with one of the highest population growth rates in the world, the number of residents in Niamey has doubled since 2005, from 750,000 to one-and-a-half million, according to the national statistics institute. Thanks to that rapid urbanisation, the forest belt has lost more than half its area since it was completed in 1993 and now measures just 25 kilometres (16 miles) long and a kilometre wide. Hailing from various social classes, the woods' soon-to-be-gone inhabitants were originally attracted to the capital's outskirts by the good quality of life and reasonable cost of a plot. The distance from the bureaucracy within Niamey proper, which can often delay construction projects by years, did not hurt either. Thermos in hand, Aboul-Razak Moussa handed out coffee to the workmen using crowbars to dig up the cobblestones in the courtyard of his brand-new building."I bought the land for 12 million CFA francs ($21,000) and invested 127 million CFA francs (more than $220,000) to build my building," the owner of a welding company lamented."We submit ourselves to Allah." Businessman Ali Hamza was indignant."We're in the peak of the rainy season, it's inhuman," the father-of-10 argued. So far, at least 4,000 people have been evicted and nearly 500 homes, mostly slums, demolished, authorities say.- Rising temperatures -Carparks, petrol stations, pharmacies, shops, rubbish dumps and health centres sprung up to cater for those who made their home in the forested area.The project to introduce a green belt around Niamey is not part of the African Union's flagship Great Green Wall initiative, but its aims are the same.Landlocked Niger lies in the heart of the Sahel, a semiarid region stretching from Senegal to Sudan where temperatures are rising 1.5 times faster than the global average.At the same time, Niger suffers periods of drought and severe flooding.It is "imperative" that Niger "preserves more green spaces", Sani Ayouba, head of the Young Volunteers for the Environment NGO said.Director General of Water and Forests within the environment ministry Yacouba Seybou said on state television that since 2004 "decrees have prohibited housing in the (green) belt".Under the law, offenders face three months to two years in prison.Former ministers have "authorised private housing developments", Boubacar Maman, an official at the urban planning ministry, said.The environment ministry says a zoo and aquatic park as well as a botanic garden, sports and leisure area will soon be created within the forested green belt.bh/bam/bdi/sbk-kjm/yadEnd of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousTransform your boring sandals with trendy DIY embellishmentsLifestyleBhagyashri Borse's style statementsEntertainmentFrom Pulitzer to Orange: 10 prestigious awards given for LiteratureLifestyle10 veggies that can grow in containers in balconyLifestyle'Kingom' actor Vijay Deverakonda’s stylish looksEntertainmentVijay Deverakonda’s fitness workout routineEntertainmentTop 10 colour-changing birds of IndiaLifestyleRaksha Bandhan-worthy mehendi designs to try this yearLifestyle10 things to know before getting an Arowana fish for good luckLifestyleMouni Roy’s top 10 gorgeous ethnic lookstv Next123 Photostories  Top 6 zoos to visit across India for a complete wildlife experience10 minute daily habits that are perfect brain exercisesBigg Boss Malayalam 7 Contestant Aryan Kathuria: All about the handsome actor featured in a Poonam Pandey show6 healthy smart foods for babies when their teeth hurtFrom white themed rooms to aesthetic details: Debinna Bonnerjee’s living and bedroom give peaceful vibesHow to spend 5 days in Madhya Pradesh: The perfect Orchha–Khajuraho itineraryRisk of type 1 diabetes may depend on where childhood is spentBigg Boss Malayalam 7 contestant Abhisree: All about the actor-dancer with an inspiring journey5 filling foods under 50 calories7 key boundaries mentally strong people set to thrive at work123Hot PicksKamala HarrisIndian NavyJ&K landslideTrump TariffsUPI New RulesGST collectionsJulia HymanTop TrendingWWE Summerslam HighlightsHailee SteinfeldsTop Richest Billionaries in the worldEarthquake VideoLebron James WifeRJ MahvashGerman Influencer BengaluruKannada signboard ruleNayara EnergyIndia US Crude OilTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire Website'Disgraceful': Ex-South Korea president Yoon Suk Yeol resists questioning by laying down in underwear;

Turkish city calls for help after heat tops 50 degree celsius
Southeastern Turkey is reeling under a record-breaking heatwave, with temperatures exceeding 50C in Silopi. Residents are struggling with soaring electricity bills due to constant air conditioning use and are appealing for state support. Deforestation and policy changes allowing mining on agricultural lands exacerbate the heat, intensifying the challenges faced by locals who depend on air conditioning as a necessity.

Residents are struggling with soaring electricity bills due to constant air conditioning use and are appealing for state support. Deforestation and policy changes allowing mining on agricultural lands exacerbate the heat, intensifying the challenges faced by locals who depend on air conditioning as a necessity. Representative Image  A choking heatwave left astonished locals in southeastern Turkey calling for state help to pay their air conditioning bills after the temperature surged past 50 degree celsius."We cannot cope with the heat," ice-cream maker Recep Esiyok, 59, told AFP in Silopi, where meteorologists measured 50.5C on Friday -- a national record."I've been living in Silopi for about 30 years. I've never seen such heat... I've never seen such heat anywhere."He is getting through the heatwave thanks to the air conditioner in his shop, but is now worried about paying for the electricity."My bill last month was 59,000 lira (1,450 dollars). We are asking for state support on this issue."'Incomparable' heat: Before Friday's record, the previous peak in Turkey had been 49.5 degree celsius in August 2023.Scientists agree that climate change caused by humans burning fossil fuels is increasing the likelihood, length and intensity of heatwaves."The heat has reached a point where it's incomparable to previous years," said Halil Coskun, 52, a local reporter.The country is still in the grip of the heatwave and since Sunday temperatures overall have surged from six to 12 degrees above seasonal norms, according to the state meteorology directorate.Wildfire threat: Turkey has fought fires in several regions since the start of the summer. Last week, 10 people perished while fighting a fire in Eskisehir province.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday the country has experienced drier conditions than normal over the past five years as a result of global warming."Extreme heat, low humidity, and strong winds are unfortunately increasing the risk of fire," he said.He said the state was using drones to monitor and protect forests.The streets were relatively empty and the atmosphere tense in Silopi, a Kurdish city whose main income is trade with Iraq across the border 10 kilometres (six miles) away."When it's hot, there's no one outside during the day," said Esiyok.Deforestation complaints: Other locals complained at the lack of vegetation to provide relief around the town, which lies at the foot of a mountain."Unfortunately, the forests here were burned in the past for security reasons," said Coskun.He said the Turkish army cleared them in the search for fighters from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a rebel group that recently disarmed.Turkey's parliament this month also passed a bill that opens certain agricultural lands including olive groves to mining activities, despite widespread opposition."We could at least minimise the heat by planting trees, not by felling them," Coskun said.Electricity bills: Sweating in his kebab shop, another local, Cemil Seher, said that summers in Silopi last not three months, but five.For Seher, 51, air conditioning is no longer a luxury but a necessity."AC is essential here as much as bread and water," he said."When the air conditioners are running, the electricity bills are very high," he said, demanding authorities offer discounts for businesses."I want a discount not only for Silopi but for the entire region from here to Sanliurfa" in the east, he said."I am not making a profit because I've been working... to pay my electricity bill."Discover stories of India’s leading eco-innovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksKamala HarrisBogota AirportUS Oil ReserveTrump TariffsUPI New RulesStarlink SatelliteJulia HymanTop TrendingTravis KelceTom BradyBengaluru Boy Kidnap MurderCBSE Class 10th Sample PapersHow new nep rule worksYuzvendra Chahal DatingStephen CurryJoe BurrowBlake LivelyTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website40 jobs AI can't touch in 2025, says Microsoft Research: Is your career on the list?Former PM HD Devegowda's grandson Prajwal Revanna convicted for raping 47-year-old domestic helpIND vs ENG Live: Rain likely to play spoilsport as India eye 300; Woakes ruled outUPI new rules 2025: New NPCI changes kick in from August 1 - All you need to knowSSC exam 2025 glitches spark massive nationwide protest: Here’s why #SSCMisManagement is trending on social mediaCAT 2025 registration begins at iimcat.ac.in: Check direct link to apply online hereAP Police Constable final result 2025 released at slprb.ap.gov.in; check direct link hereIs Yuzvendra Chahal dating RJ Mahvash?

Chinese sub discovers deepest-ever creatures 10 km undersea
A Chinese submersible has discovered thousands of worms and molluscs nearly 10 kilometres (six miles) below sea level in the Mariana Trench, the deepest colony of creatures ever observed, a study revealed on Wednesday. Last year, the Chinese submersible "Fendouzhe" -- or "Striver" -- dove 23 times into the depths of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean with researchers on board, according to the study in the journal Nature.

Last year, the Chinese submersible "Fendouzhe" -- or "Striver" -- dove 23 times into the depths of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean with researchers on board, according to the study in the journal Nature. AP file photo PARIS: A Chinese submersible has discovered thousands of worms and molluscs nearly 10 kilometres (six miles) below sea level in the Mariana Trench, the deepest colony of creatures ever observed, a study revealed on Wednesday.The discovery in Earth's deepest underwater valley suggests that there could be much more life thriving in the hostile conditions at the bottom of our planet's largely unexplored oceans than previously thought, the China-led team of scientists said.Almost all life on Earth is supported by light from the Sun. However, in the total darkness at the bottom of the world, these creatures live off of chemicals such as methane seeping through cracks in the seafloor, a process called chemosynthesis.Last year, the Chinese submersible "Fendouzhe", or "Striver", dove 23 times into the depths of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean with researchers on board, according to the study in the journal Nature.They found colonies of thousands of marine tubeworms and molluscs called bivalves at depths ranging from 2,500 to 9,533 metres (8,200 to 31,000 feet) deep. Video released alongside the study showed fields of tubeworms, which grew up to 30 centimetres (12 inches) long, as well as piles of molluscs and clams. Spiky crustaceans, free-floating marine worms, sea cucumbers, feathery-armed sea lilies and other invertebrates were also recorded in the depths.The study marked "the discovery of the deepest and the most extensive chemosynthesis-based communities known to exist on Earth," its authors said.Given that other ocean trenches are similar, "such chemosynthesis-based communities might be more widespread than previously anticipated," they added.The researchers said they also found "compelling evidence" that methane was being produced by microbes, with the tubeworms tending to cluster around microbial mats that resemble snow. Previous studies have found thriving communities of single-cell organisms on the ocean floor, but few large animals.But a remotely operated vehicle discovered tubeworms and other marine invertebrates living in hydrothermal vents in the crust below the seafloor two kilometres deep in the Pacific, research said last year.Pressure rising The new study was published as nations wrangle over the contentious issue of deep-sea mining. China, the United States and others have expressed interest in mining the depths for valuable minerals.Ocean scientists warn that mining the little-explored seafloor, one of the last wild zones on the planet, could decimate fragile ecosystems that are not yet well understood.Despite recent talks, the International Seabed Authority -- which oversees deep-sea mining in international waters -- has yet to adopt long-awaited rules governing the industry. Chinese media has previously reported that the Fendouzhe submersible mission will conduct research on "deep-sea materials".Only a handful of people have ever visited the bottom of the Mariana Trench, which is a crescent-shaped depression in the Earth's crust that is deeper than Mount Everest is high.The first explorers visited the trench in 1960 on a brief expedition.But after that, there were no missions until Hollywood director James Cameron made the first solo trip to the bottom in 2012, describing a "desolate" and "alien" environment.The water pressure at the bottom of the trench is a crushing eight tons per square inch, more than a thousand times the atmospheric pressure at sea level.Discover stories of India’s leading eco-innovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksKamala HarrisBogota AirportUS Oil ReserveTrump TariffsUPI New RulesStarlink SatelliteJulia HymanTop TrendingTravis KelceTom BradyBengaluru Boy Kidnap MurderCBSE Class 10th Sample PapersHow new nep rule worksYuzvendra Chahal DatingStephen CurryJoe BurrowBlake LivelyTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteSSC exam 2025 glitches spark massive nationwide protest: Here’s why #SSCMisManagement is trending on social mediaCAT 2025 registration begins at iimcat.ac.in: Check direct link to apply online hereAP Police Constable final result 2025 released at slprb.ap.gov.in; check direct link hereIs Yuzvendra Chahal dating RJ Mahvash?

An aerial view of the Don River in the newly unveiled Biidaasige Park, part of Toronto's Port Lands Flood Protection Project, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (AFP photo) TORONTO: The spur to build Toronto's billion-dollar-plus flood prevention project dates back to a devastating hurricane in 1954, but planners say its urgency was reinforced by the recent tragic flooding in Texas.The Port Lands project has, in part, reversed a consequence of industrialization by reconnecting Lake Ontario with the Don River, more than a century after they were severed to create an industrial area.Chris Glaisek, chief planning officer at the municipal body Waterfront Toronto, said the idea was to "heal the land from the way it was repurposed 100 years ago," with a focus on "flood protection and naturalization."The complex project -- one of the largest in Toronto's history with a cost of Can$1.4 billion (US$1 billion) -- included digging a river valley and the creation of two new river outlets, with wetlands and marshes to absorb excess water during extreme storms.The mouth of the Don River was once the Great Lakes system's largest fresh water marsh, a rich habitat and vital food resource for Indigenous people before colonization.But Toronto, like many North American cities, saw industrial growth in the late 19th Century.Much of the marsh was drained and filled in to make room for a port industrial area, while the river was re-routed into a man-made channel. The Port Lands never thrived as an industrial area, leaving a vast stretch of eastern downtown under-used, and the Don River became polluted. "It was really dirty, it was foul, it was terrible," Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow said recently. - Hurricane Hazel -On October 15, 1954 Hurricane Hazel hit Toronto, after hammering parts of the Caribbean and eastern United States.It killed 81 people across the Greater Toronto Area and served as catalyst for the city to get serious about flood protection. Hazel flooded the Humber River, in western Toronto, but Glaisek said "it was understood at the time that that same amount of rainfall, had it landed on the (eastern) Don, would have done a comparable amount of damage." He called Hazel an initial "impetus" to re-naturalize the Port Lands, but rising awareness over the past two decades about the causal link between climate change and extreme floods helped advance the project. - 'Duty bound' -To reclaim the Port Lands, Toronto partnered with the US-based landscape architecture firm Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, which has worked on the Brooklyn Bridge Park and the Obama Presidential Center in Chicago.Laura Solano, the lead designer, said the project was "duty bound to address catastrophic flooding," but stressed it offered "much more."Because the area has been reformed to cope with flood waters, parts have been declared safe for new housing -- an urgent need in the expensive metropolis.There is also a new park, trails and people can canoe or kayak through the rehabilitated Don.Solano stressed Toronto's initial decision to alter the area was consistent with the times, when North American cities moved to "industrialize their waters...to raise their economic position."But now, "every city is looking to reclaim their waters," she told AFP. The Port Lands "shows the world that it's possible to fix the past and turn deficit and remnant industrial lands into living and breathing infrastructure."- 'The river is going to flood' -As Glaisek described the project, he stood on a bank that would, by design, be under water during a major storm."It's all planned so that it can flood, the water level can rise, the river can get about three, maybe four times wider than it is now, absorb all of that volume of water," he said. "When the storm event subsides, it will shrink back down to this."It's a planning approach that recognizes "we're seeing more and more of these events.""Like in Texas, you see very tragic outcomes when you haven't really tried to plan for nature," he told AFP, referring to flash floods in early July that killed at least 135 people. He urged planners to "reposition" their relationship to nature and ditch the mindset that "humans (can) control everything.""Let's acknowledge the river is going to flood. Let's build the space for it." bs/desEnd of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousWhen Mrunal Thakur wore the most wedding-worthy Banarasi sareeLifestyle10 Indian baby names inspired by Indian languages and scriptsLifestyle10 interesting facts about Kiran Desai and her Booker Prize 2025 longlisted bookLifestyleShobha Shetty’s top 10 half-saree lookstv8 air-purifying plants for your homeLifestyleIn pics: Glamorous looks of actress Bindhu MadhavitvTake cues from Rashmika Mandanna's traditional attires this ShravanEntertainmentKnow the pros and cons of using derma rollers for faster hair growthLifestyleSai Pallavi and her love for eyelinersEntertainment10 most-friendly animals in India!Lifestyle Next123 Photostories  Priyanka Chopra said NO to these 5 hit films - Guess who got them insteadBehind the villain’s mask, Ranjeet’s real story will surprise you5 miracle oils that can actually help grow hair on bald patchesKidney vs Gallbladder stones: What's the difference and 5 very early symptoms you shouldn’t ignoreWhy are Guppy and Swordtail fish ideal starter options for new aquarists5 Friendship Day-perfect destinations in India to reconnect with your old buddiesGrow these 5 vegetables in pots – No backyard neededNo bad time to travel: 7 Indian destinations that are great year-roundTop 5 foods for muscle recoveryTrain the brain to love discipline: 7 habits that can help123Hot PicksMeteor ShowersOperation MahadevP&G CEOIndia US TradeLenskart IPOTCS share priceJulia HymanTop TrendingTaylor SwiftNBA Trade RumorsNazem KadriJarred VanderbiltBoeing 787 DreamlinerYankee Stadium Viral videoDeandre AytonVanessa BryantIndia US Trade AgreementNHL Trade RumorsTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteLondon airspace shut: All outbound UK flights hit by air traffic control 'technical issue'Saudi Arabia’s EV maker, Lucid, breaks world record with 1,205 km drive across Europe in single chargeSaikat Chakrabarti vs Nancy Pelosi: Meet Indian-American challenging Godmother of Dem Party — in her own backyardExplained: Why a Russian earthquake triggered tsunami alerts in Hawaii, Japan, and the US West CoastUAE: Will influencers need an advertiser permit to post on social media?

Kanchan trees, nature-based solution to riverbank erosion in Majuli (Image: ANI) MAJULI: In the village of Pathorichuk, Majuli, Assam, local residents have discovered a remarkable way to combat riverbank erosion by planting Kanchan trees along the Brahmaputra River. This sustainable and eco-friendly approach has proven to be a natural shield against the relentless forces of erosion.Each year, the mighty Brahmaputra, along with its tributaries Subansiri and Kherkatia, relentlessly eats away at Majuli's landmass, threatening its very existence. Traditional anti-erosion measures such as RCC porcupines and geo-bags have only offered temporary relief and have largely failed to provide long-term protection.However, the residents of Pathorichuk have discovered a sustainable and local solution. By planting large numbers of Kanchan trees along the riverbanks, the village has managed to significantly reduce the impact of erosion in the area. The deep-rooted trees not only hold the soil together but also act as a natural barrier against the strong river currents.The success of Pathorichuk village presents a compelling case for the broader adoption of ecological methods to combat erosion. Locals now urge the government, administrative bodies, and concerned departments to consider the large-scale plantation of Kanchan trees across erosion-prone areas of Majuli.If replicated effectively, this eco-friendly and cost-effective model could play a key role in safeguarding Majuli, the world's largest river island, from further disappearance. While speaking to ANI, Nirab Tai, a local from Pathorichuk village, said, "We used to face heavy erosion in the past, and our village was constantly under threat. Around 20 years ago, our elders planted these trees to prevent erosion. Since then, the erosion has completely stopped, and our village is now safe. These trees are like blessings to us, they protect us. We call them "Kanchan trees" in Assamese.""I believe that if Kanchan trees are planted along the banks of the Brahmaputra River, there will be no erosion, and all the villages near the river will be protected. These trees grow very rapidly. You don't have to do much, just plant a branch of the Kanchan tree, and it will grow, especially quickly during the monsoon season. From a single tree, many more Kanchan trees will grow.The RCC porcupines used by the government to control erosion often get submerged during the monsoon season. But these trees are doing a tremendous job. They not only protect the land but also provide a healthy environment, shade, and natural beauty." Another local, Krishna Payeng, told ANI, "These trees grow from branches. When planted near rivers, they gradually grow massively and help control soil erosion. The government should consider this seriously. Along with geo bags, if we plant Kanchan trees, erosion can be effectively controlled."He suggested distributing these trees among students and highlighting their benefits on World Environment Day."These trees should be distributed among students, and they should be informed about their benefits. On World Environment Day, the positive impact of these trees should be highlighted. I sincerely request the government to look into this matter and plant Kanchan trees in areas highly affected by erosion, not only in our country, but across the world."The success of Pathorichuk village's initiative presents a compelling case for adopting ecological methods to combat erosion. By embracing nature-based solutions, we can protect the world's largest river island, Majuli, from further disappearance.

Early Hawaiian petroglyphs on a beach are visible again with changing tides and shifting sands
Ancient Hawaiian petroglyphs, featuring human-like figures, have resurfaced on Oahu's Waianae coast after years of being hidden by sand. Seasonal ocean swells revealed the panel of over two dozen images, dating back at least 500 years. Glen Kila, a Native Hawaiian cultural expert, believes this reappearance signals a message from ancestors about rising sea levels.

Early Hawaiian petroglyphs on a beach are visible again (Image: AP) WAIANAE: Hawaiian petroglyphs dating back at least a half-millennium are visible on Oahu for the first time in years, thanks to seasonal ocean swells that peel away sand covering a panel of more than two dozen images of mostly human-looking stick figures.  The petroglyphs are easy to spot during low tide when gentle waves ebb and flow over slippery, neon-green algae growing on a stretch of sandstone. This is the first time the entire panel of petroglyphs are visible since they were first spotted nine years ago by two guests staying at a bayside US Army recreation centre in Waianae, about an hour's drive from Honolulu. Native Hawaiian cultural practitioner Glen Kila, who traces his lineage to the aboriginal families of this coastal Hawaii community, said he believes the resurfacing of the traditional marvels are his ancestors sending a message. "It's telling the community that the ocean is rising," said Kila, a recognized expert on the local culture and history of Waianae who is consulting with the Army on the protection of the petroglyphs.  Army officials are trying to balance protecting the petroglyphs with their accessibility on a public beach.  John and Sandy Stone consulted tide charts and drove about 30 minutes from their home early Tuesday to get a glimpse after a watching a local TV report about the petroglyphs.  "It was so interesting to touch them," said John Stone, who splits his time between Hawaii and California. "It felt interesting to kind of have a connection with the past like that."  It is difficult to date petroglyphs, but an archaeological site in the area is from about 600 years ago, said Laura Gilda, an archaeologist with US Army Garrison Hawaii. According to Kila, Hawaiians arrived in Waianae at least 1,000 years ago.  Shift in waves caused petroglyphs to appear The beach here fluctuates in size and profile each year, with low-pressure weather systems that form in the eastern Pacific between May and November causing waves that cut away loose sand from shorelines and redeposit them further out, according to an Army report on the petroglyphs. That shift is likely what causes their temporary exposure.  Archaeologists identified a total of 26 petroglyphs. Of the 18 anthropomorphic stick figures, eight are depicted with possible male genitalia and the remainder are of undetermined gender, the report said.  The entire panel stretches about 115 feet (35 meters) long, Gilda said.  When the petroglyphs first reemerged in July 2016, it was after late spring and early summer storms, including hurricanes, with a lot of wave action that swept the sand away, Gilda said.  They remained visible for a period and then got covered again.  "So there's been portions that have ... been exposed since then, but this is the first summer that the whole panel has been exposed again," Gilda said.  Petroglyphs are telling a religious story, expert says Based on the teachings Kila learned, the lineal petroglyphs appear to be telling a religious, ceremonial story. He interprets the largest figure, which appears to include hands and fingers with one arm raised and the other down, to represent the rising and setting sun.  Kila said that when the military in the 1930s took over the area and evicted Native Hawaiians, including his family who lived there for generations, his great-great grandmother refused to leave so his family exchanged mountain lands with a coffee plantation so she could remain near the bay.  In an interview included in the Army's report, he recalled growing up in Waianae without television. So "the ocean and mountains were our playground," he said. The Army recreation centre was off-limits to the public, and the seawall was the barrier between Native Hawaiians and the military, Kila said.  Kila, now 72, recalled that if they walked on top of the wall, they were clubbed and pushed off by military police.  "We were proud and knew where we came from, so we never fostered any hatred for the military because one day we believed that the land will eventually return to us," he said.  Kila, while visiting the petroglyphs earlier this week, told The Associated Press that the Army's protection of them represents a shift in that community relationship.  Officials have been grappling with how to share the petroglyphs with the community while also protecting them, Gilda said.  "How much attention do you want to bring to this area? You don't really want people to go digging for them when they're not exposed," she said. "But they're certainly awesome to come and see on the public beachscape." Donald Kauliʻa, a Native Hawaiian who was born and raised in Waianae, snapped photos of the petroglyphs Tuesday. Seeing them, he said, feels like "validation that our ancestors were from here."End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksParliament Monsoon SessionColumbia UniversityTesla stock earningsSovereign Gold BondsTCS new benching policyRajasthan building collapseRussian Plane MissingTop TrendingHulk Hogan WifeStephen CurryKendrick LamarUGC reformGisele BundchenConnor McDavidSteven OleksyShannon SharpeDwyane Wades WifeDylan HarperTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteBill Gates says: When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is ...TN Class 12th Supply Result 2025 Live: Tamil Nadu HSC results to be declared today, check how to download marksheets onlineUGC, AICTE, NCTE to be scrapped: Will a new super-regulator end the chaos these three could never control?Ciara and baby Amora twin in new adorable photo as fans gush over Russell Wilson's lookalike daughterWho is Hulk Hogan’s wife Sky Daily?

That's according to the international sustainability organization Global Footprint Networkand York University in Toronto, Canada.The day, which is observed annually, comes just over a week earlier than last year's date— mainly due to the fact that oceans can absorb less CO2 than previously reported.We are overconsuming by depleting nature's capital faster than it can replenish, which is visible in deforestation, loss of biodiversity and the accumulation of carbon emissions in the atmosphere. And it is part of a trend that started back in the early 1970s.Mathis Wackernagel, co-founder of the Global Footprint Network, told DW that using too many resources is driving many "environmental ills," and that regularly using more than the planet can naturally reproduce has a cumulative effect. "Even if we keep it at the same level, we increase the ecological debt that the world endures," he said, adding that the ensuing "debt is measurable."Overconsumption is a global problemQatar, Luxembourg and Singapore were first in hitting their respective country overshoot days back in February. The US was not far behind. If everyone on the planet consumed like people in the US, resources would be depleted by March 13. Germany and Poland land on May 3, China and Spain on May 23, South Africa on July 2.Wackernagel said high income "typically leads to higher resource consumption," but added that it is not the only driver.Qatar, with a desert climate with low annual rainfall and intensely hot, humid summers, relies heavily on air conditioning powered by fossil fuel energy. "They have easy access to fossil fuels, so fossil fuel use is cheap and that has a big footprint," he said, adding the country also uses up a lot of resources for the energy intensive process of desalinating seawater.Uruguay, on the other hand, is not projected to start overconsuming until December 17. It has successfully turned to renewable energy to power its grid, relying mainly on hydroelectricity, wind and biomass.Sticking to what Earth can replenishAnd then there are the countries that stay within bounds of the planet's capacity such as India, Kenya and Nigeria, among others. In order to stay within our means, the world's ecological footprint would have to equal the available biocapacity per person on our planet, which currently stands at about 1.5 global hectares.Biocapacity is defined as land and ocean areas that provide resources such as food and timber, can accommodate urban infrastructure and absorb excess CO2. Anything higher than the global available biocapacity per person is overexploiting resources.Germany has about the same amount of biocapacity per person as the global average, but uses about three times more, Wackernagel said.While India, the world's most populous country, uses more than the country itself can renew in a year, globally speaking "the level of consumption is less than one planet," he said, adding that one planet should not be the goal. "There are also other species, so we should probably be below one planet to be robust."Decades of overusing are taking a tollWackernagel said we are taking resources "far beyond what Earth can regenerate" yet have a collective understanding that what we are doing is fine. "But we're fooling ourselves."Paul Shrivastava, co-president of think tank Club of Rome, said it's time to rethink how we understand economies. "We need to change from that extractive mindset of the economy to a regenerative one," he told DW."Mining is a kind of extraction. Oil is a kind of extraction. Once we take it out of the earth, we don't give anything back," he added.Wackernagel said it's not about what we need to give up, but rather how we can prepare ourselves for the future and what will be valuable then.Rather than adjusting economies to reduce overshooting, people are trying to squeeze the last bit out of the toothpaste tube, Wackernagel said."In the United States, where I live, I could see that many of the themes around the elections last year were very overshoot related. For example, the fear of not having enough energy," he said. However, the government has failed to address the problem of overshooting and instead pushed to "drill more holes and get more fossil fuels" out of the ground. How to push back Overshoot Day?The Global Footprint Network has outlined a number of solutions in five key areas to push back the date of Earth Overshoot Day.The energy sector is by far the biggest factor at play: Placing a price on carbon emissions that reflects the true cost of carbon pollution on the planet would help move the date by 63 days.Smart cities with integrated transport systems, advanced energy management and foresight through sensors to regulate energy in buildings could add another 29 days to the calendar.Replacing coal and gas-fired power plants with renewable energy such as solar and wind and generating 75% of electricity from low-carbon sources would move the date by another 26 days.Halving food waste would provide another 13 extra days and replacing 50% of global meat consumption with plant-based alternatives would add seven days from CO2 emissions and land use alone. Just one meatless day per week would add around two days.'Vested interests in maintaining the current system'"There are vested interests in maintaining the current system" such as in fossil fuels, said Shrivastava.And while individual changes such as eating less meat, favouring biking over car rides and vacationing closer to home rank comparatively low on the power of possibility chart, voters have the power to push for systemic changes."We don't control all of that individually, but we can have a say in it and we can talk to the people who have a say in it," said Shrivastava, by engaging in peaceful protests and in supporting local political candidates that have an ecological vision. Such changes will come from the power of the people, he added."Overshoot is the second-largest risk humanity faces this century," Wackernagel said. "The largest one is not to respond."End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksParliament Monsoon SessionRussia oil sanctionsICICI BankSovereign Gold BondsTCS new benching policyVibrio VulnificusLindsey GrahamTop TrendingShane Taylor RooksNFL NetworkLeBron JamesNHL Trade RumorsConnor McDavidChristian JarosShannon SharpeDwyane Wades WifeFOX Sports Analyst Cris CarterTravis HunterTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteRishabh Pant Injury Recap: ‘He was in a lot of pain’ — Watch dramatic video from Manchester Test'Surreal': Astronomer CEO speaks out about Andy Byron's Coldplay scandal, says company has now become a household nameBill Gates says: When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is ...“My body failed me”: Dwyane Wade’s wife Gabrielle Union opens up about facing “public humiliation” after choosing surrogacyWho is Bryan Johnson: Anti-aging champion who spent $2 million a year on his body now set to shut down or sell age-reversing startup due to financial lossesWorld's largest asset manager BlackRock to employees: You cannot carry your phones and laptops to China, instead …Solar Eclipse on August 2: Why world will be under darkness for over 6 minutes in a rare 100-year phenomenon; is it visible in India?Israel's key airport attacked: Houthi millitants launch missile at Tel Aviv; bombing destroys port's dock againLawsuit or ...: Why Astronomer has not fired HR head Kristin Cabot while CEO Andy Byron resignedWho is Connor Estelle?

Last year, 74% of the growth in electricity generated worldwide was from wind, solar and other green sources, according to the UN's multiagency report, called Seizing the Moment of Opportunity. It found that 92.5% of all new electricity capacity added to the grid worldwide in that time period came from renewables. Meanwhile, sales of electric vehicles are up from 500,000 in 2015 to more than 17 million in 2024. The three cheapest electricity sources globally last year were onshore wind, solar panels and new hydropower, according to an energy cost report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). Solar power now is 41% cheaper and wind power is 53% cheaper globally than the lowest-cost fossil fuel, the reports said. Fossil fuels, which are the chief cause of climate change, include coal, oil and natural gas. "The fossil fuel age is flailing and failing," United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in Tuesday morning speech unveiling the reports. "We are in the dawn of a new energy era. An era where cheap, clean, abundant energy powers a world rich in economic opportunity." "Just follow the money," Guterres said, quoting the reports that showed last year there was $2 trillion in investment in green energy, which is about $800 billion more than in fossil fuels. UN officials say switch to renewables needs to speed up Still, United Nations officials said the switch to renewable energy, while remarkable compared to 10 years ago, is not happening fast enough. The global renewables growth has been mostly in developed countries such as China - where one-tenth of the economy is tied up in green energy - as well as countries such as India and Brazil.  Yet Africa represented less than 2% of the new green energy capacity installed last year despite having great electrification needs, the reports said. United Nations officials blamed the high cost of capital for the Global South. "The Global South must be empowered to generate its own electricity without adding to already unsustainable level of debts," said Bahamian climate scientist Adelle Thomas of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Thomas, who did not work on the reports, added that they debunk the myth that clean energy cannot compete with fossil fuels, instead showing a clean energy future is not just possible but likely inevitable. The UN reports are "right on the money," said University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck, who also wasn't part of the studies. He said the economic tipping point leads to a cycle that keeps driving renewable costs down and makes fossil fuel power less and less desirable. Renewables grow despite high subsidies for fossil fuels And renewables are booming despite fossil fuels getting nearly nine times the government consumption subsidies as they do, Guterres and the reports said. In 2023, global fossil fuel subsidies amounted to $620 billion, compared to $70 billion for renewables, the UN report said. But just as renewables are booming, fossil fuel production globally is still increasing, instead of going down in response. United Nations officials said that's because power demand is increasing overall, spurred by developing countries, artificial intelligence data centers and the need for cooling in an ever warmer world. "A typical AI data center eats up as much electricity as 100,000 homes," Guterres said. "By 2030 data centers could consume as much electricity as all of Japan does today." So Guterres called on the world's major tech firms to power data centers completely with renewables by 2030. Solar and wind power face US cuts to renewable energy programs In the United States, solar and wind power had been growing at a rate of 12.3% per year from 2018 to 2023, the IRENA report said. But since President Donald Trump took office earlier this year, his administration has withdrawn the nation from the landmark Paris climate accord and cut many federal renewable energy programs, with a renewed emphasis on fossil fuels.  Guterres warned nations hanging on to fossil fuels that they were heading down a dangerous path that would make them poorer not richer, without naming the United States specifically. "Countries that cling to fossil fuels are not protecting their economies, they sabotaging them. Driving up costs. Undermining competitiveness. Locking in stranded assets," Guterres said. Renewables are the smart way to go for energy security, Guterres said. With renewables, he said, "there are no price spikes for sunlight. No embargoes on wind."

(Picture credit: AP) HANOI: Tropical Storm Wipha made landfall in northern Vietnam on Tuesday, bringing strong winds and heavy rain to parts of the country's north and central regions.The storm came ashore at 10 am with sustained winds of 64-102 kilometres per hour (40-63 mph), and gusts up to 138 kph (86 mph), according to local weather officials. After landfall, it began moving southwest.Wipha was classified as a typhoon on Monday while over open water, but weakened overnight and was downgraded to a tropical storm before reaching land.The storm knocked out power in parts of Hung Yen Province, east of Hanoi. Residents rushed to gas stations to buy fuel for generators, state media reported.The streets of the capital city, Hanoi, were nearly empty as the storm moved inland. Most businesses were closed and the city government has advised residents to stay home and evacuate buildings that are unstable or in flood-prone areas."If the storm is serious, people shouldn't go out anyway because it would be dangerous on the road and there is also a chance of flooding," said Minh Doan, a taxi driver in Hanoi.Flights were cancelled across northern Vietnam, and airports in the port city of Hai Phong and Quang Ninh province were closed.Nearly 150,000 hectares (370,000 acres) of aquaculture farms and more than 20,000 floating fish cages are at risk from flooding and strong winds, according to state media.Vietnam has warned of flooding as heavy rain from Storm Wipha moves inland.In the Philippines, more than 80,000 people remain in emergency shelters after floods, landslides and tidal surges over the weekend.Most government offices and schools in the capital and 10 provinces were shut Tuesday due to widespread flooding from heavy monsoon rains, and droops evacuated residents from villages swamped by knee-to-waist-deep water while the coast guard deployed buses and boats to assist stranded commuters. At least three people have died.Global warming is making storms like Wipha stronger and wetter, said Benjamin P Horton, dean of the School of Energy and Environment at City University of Hong Kong. Warmer oceans give tropical storms more fuel, leading to more intense winds, heavier rain and shifting rainfall patterns across East Asia. "Rising sea surface temperatures, fueled by climate change, can intensify these storms," he said.

John Warmington mourns the loss of his beloved reef, now a coral graveyard. The International Court of Justice will advise on nations' climate obligations, a potential turning point for holding major emitters accountable. The once iconic Holiday Inn villas in Port Vila, Vanuatu, sit partially sunken, after being hit by multiple cyclones and an earthquake that caused irreparable damage. (Picture credit: AP) PORT VILA: When John Warmington first began diving the reefs outside his home in Vanuatu's Havannah Harbour a decade ago, the coral rose like a sunken forest - tall stands of staghorns branched into yellow antlers, plate corals layered like canopies, and clouds of darting fish wove through the labyrinth.  "We used to know every inch of that reef," he said. "It was like a friend." Now, it's unrecognisable. After Cyclone Pam battered the reef in 2015, sediment from inland rivers smothered the coral beds. Crown-of-thorns starfish swept in and devoured the recovering polyps. Back-to-back cyclones in 2023 crushed what was left. Then, in December 2024, a 7.3 magnitude earthquake shook the seabed.  What remains is a coral graveyard - bleached rubble scattered across the seafloor, habitats collapsed, life vanished. "We've come out of the water in tears," said Warmington, who has logged thousands of dives on this single reef. "We just see heartbreak." That heartbreak is becoming more common across this Pacific island nation, where intensifying cyclones, rising seas and saltwater intrusion are reshaping coastlines and threatening daily life. Since 1993, sea levels around Vanuatu's shores have risen by about 6 millimetres (0.24 inches) per year - significantly faster than the global average - and in some areas, tectonic activity has doubled that rate. International court to opine on nations' obligations to address climate change. On Wednesday, Vanuatu will get its day in the world's highest court. The International Court of Justice will issue an advisory opinion on what legal obligations nations have to address climate change and what consequences they may face if they don't. The case, led by Vanuatu and backed by more than 130 countries, is seen as a potential turning point in international climate law. "Seeing large, polluting countries just continue business as usual and not take the climate crisis seriously can get really sad and disappointing," said 16-year-old climate activist Vepaiamele Trief. "If they rule in our favour, that could change everything." The opinion won't be legally binding, but could help shape future efforts to hold major emitters accountable and secure the funding and action small island nations need to adapt or survive. It comes after decades of frustration for Pacific nations that've watched their homelands disappear. In Tuvalu, where the average elevation is just 2 meters (6.6 feet), more than a third of the population has applied for a climate migration visa to Australia. By 2100, much of the country is projected to be under water at high tide. In Nauru, the government has begun selling passports to wealthy foreigners, offering visa-free access to dozens of countries, in a bid to generate revenue for possible relocation efforts. "The agreements being made at an international level between states are not moving fast enough," said Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu's minister for climate change. "They're definitely not being met according to what the science tells us needs to happen." Vanuatu has already sought opinions from other international courts and is pushing for the recognition of ecocide - the destruction of the environment - as a crime under the International Criminal Court. "We have to keep fighting till the last bit," Regenvanu said.  How climate change is decimating Vanuatu. For children in Vanuatu, climate change isn't a theory - it's a classroom, or the lack of one. At Sainte Jeanne D'Arc school on Efate Island, elementary school teacher Noellina Tavi has spent two of the last three years teaching her students in tents - first after the 2023 cyclones and again following the 2024 earthquake.  With a shortage of emergency tents, her class was combined with another. Students fidget and lose focus. "It's too crowded," Tavi said. "We can't work peacefully." When it rains, the tents turn cold and muddy. Tavi often sends students home so they don't get sick. Anytime a storm approaches, the tents must be dismantled, the furniture carried to shelter and the children sent home. "That disrupts their education for a whole week," she said. In rural areas, extreme weather hits something even more basic: food security. On Nguna Island, farmer Kaltang Laban has watched cyclones wipe out the banana, cassava and taro crops that feed his community. "After a cyclone, we would have nothing for months," he said. Now, with support from Save the Children, Laban and other farmers are storing preserved fruits and vegetables in a facility beside their gardens. "But not every community has this," he said. More than 70% of Vanuatu's population lives in rural areas and depends on small-scale farming.  In 2025, USAID cut funding for a rainwater harvesting initiative designed to improve water access at cyclone evacuation centres in one of the country's most remote, drought-prone provinces, said Vomboe Shem, climate lead for Save the Children Vanuatu. The materials had already been shipped and distributed, but the project was halted. "These disasters are happening over and over again," Shem said. "It's pushing our communities to their limits." Not all of these impacts can be pinned solely on climate change, said Christina Shaw, CEO of the Vanuatu Environmental Science Society. Coastal development, tectonic sinking, volcanic eruptions, deforestation and pollution are also contributing to ecosystem decline. "Vanuatu's environment is quite fragile by its inherent nature in that it's young with narrow reefs, has small amounts of topsoil and is insulted regularly by natural disasters," she said. "But we do have to think about the other human impacts on our environment as well." The damage isn't limited to homes, gardens and reefs - it's reaching into places once thought to be untouchable. On the island of Pele, village chief Amos Kalsont sits at his brother's grave as waves lap against broken headstones half-buried in sand. At high tide, both his brother's and father's graves sit just a few arm's lengths from the sea. Some homes and gardens have already been moved inland, and saltwater intrusion has tainted the community's primary drinking water source. Now, the community is considering relocating the entire village - but that would mean leaving the land their grandparents cleared by hand. "The sea is catching up and we don't know what else to do," Kalsont said. "It's not fair that we have to face the consequences when we didn't contribute to this in the first place." Many in Vanuatu remain committed to building something stronger and hope the rest of the world will support them. "This is our future, and it's particularly our children's future, our grandchildren's future," said Regenvanu. "We just have to keep pushing for the best one we can." Back in Havannah Harbor, John Warmington still dives the reef he considers part of his family. While much of it is gone, he and his wife Sandy have begun replanting coral fragments in hopes of restoring what's left. "Our friend is still here," he said. "Life is coming back."

Mehar’s custom-engineered drone reached this remarkable milestone in an astonishing 0.91 seconds, a feat that not only demonstrates his technical prowess but also sets a new benchmark in the rapidly evolving world of drone technology.Mehar’s journey to this achievement has been anything but straightforward. His fascination with drones began in 8th grade, and this passion has only deepened over the years. With a keen interest in pushing technological boundaries, Mehar embarked on a months-long project to build a drone capable of unparalleled vertical acceleration.“I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of pushing the limits of what drones can do,” Mehar explained. “But breaking a world record wasn’t just about the end result; it was about the process. I wanted to prove that current technology could achieve something extraordinary, but the path to get there was filled with challenges.”The project required Mehar to design, test, and refine multiple drone prototypes. “There were moments when I felt like I was chasing an impossible dream,” Mehar recalled. “I went through countless designs, and many of them failed during testing. Some drones crashed so badly that I had no choice but to go back to the drawing board and start from scratch. Each crash was a setback, but it also sparked new ideas and innovations.”Undeterred by the setbacks, Mehar poured his energy into creating a drone that was not only fast but also aerodynamically optimized. “I spent countless hours on CAD software, meticulously designing and tweaking each component. The goal was to make the drone as streamlined as possible, which led me to shape it like a rocket. This design wasn’t just about aesthetics; it was about reducing drag and maximizing speed.”Mehar’s dedication to his craft paid off in spectacular fashion. “Every failure taught me something valuable,” he said. “It forced me to think creatively and to consider every detail, from the materials used to the weight distribution of the drone. The process was grueling, but it was also incredibly rewarding to see my ideas take flight—literally.”This record-breaking achievement is more than just a personal triumph for Mehar; it has significant implications for the future of drone technology. “The possibilities are endless,” Mehar mused. “High-speed vertical acceleration could revolutionize everything from emergency response to space exploration. This isn’t just about setting a record; it’s about opening doors to new innovations and applications.”Mehar’s groundbreaking work has already begun to inspire others in the drone community and beyond. “I hope this accomplishment encourages other young innovators to push their own boundaries,” he said. “Technology is advancing rapidly, and there’s so much potential waiting to be unlocked. I’m excited to see where we can go from here.”As Mehar looks ahead, the sky is truly the limit. With his record-breaking drone, he has not only made history but also set the stage for future breakthroughs in drone technology. And for this young innovator, this is just the beginning of an exciting journey into the future of flight.Disclaimer: Content produced by Mediawire on Behalf of Shweta SinghEnd of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaTop TrendingAllen IversonCam SkatteboLebron JamesDwyane WadeSharmishtha PanoliDerrick HenryTurkish Airlines DGCA warningBrad MarchandWhere to Watch NBA FinalBengaluru NewsTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteTrump ally Laura Loomer says Republican law makers wondering if they should side with President Trump or Elon Musk; Tesla CEO responds: Trump has 3.5 years left as President, but I ...Rise in COVID-19 Cases: 7 essential medical gadgets for home useThis is likely Elon Musk’s ‘Most Read’ tweet on Donald TrumpIt's War out there: Donald Trump says very disappointed with Elon Musk; Tesla CEO respondsKeep EV subsidies with you, but ..., says Very Angry Elon Musk to Donald TrumpRobots could soon replace humans to deliver your Amazon ordersAsus launches a mouse that literally makes work smell betterHow Steve Ballmer may have just agreed with Android co-founder for Bill Gates being responsible for Microsoft losing $400 billion-plus in smartphone warPoland's biggest game developer brings cyberpunk 2077 to Nintendo for the first timeMumbai's second Apple Store likely to open in Borivali: Rent, lease period and other details revealed‘Her laptop is still on the office table, but she is not’: Bengaluru techie dream ends in grief"Not knowing Calvin is wild": New York Giants rookie Cam Skattebo leaves NFL fans in disbelief after failing to recognize NFL legends in viral quiz“The true definition of a son” -NBA legend Allen Iverson shares heartfelt post on his son days after making sweet gesture towards ex-wife“Harshest critics”: Wayne Gretzky's daughter Paulina Gretzky on overcoming criticism and learning to love herself unapologeticallyUkraine's drone attack on Russia used open-source software, 'upset' developer says wanted to make flying robots: 'not in a million years...'Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis: If I were a student right now, I would study ...“It was really hard for me”- LeBron James’ wife Savannah reveals how being a teenage mother negatively impacted her sense of identityFBI reacts to Colorado attacker Mohamed Sabry Soliman not being charged with terror: 'We are not Federal Bureau of Word Games'Eid al-Adha prayer timings announced across UAE – find out the time in your cityUAE Golden Visa: Which universities make you eligible?

The formats mentioned above are most prominently used globally. JPGs can be different things like signatures required to sign documents or screenshots of an instruction manual. When converting JPG to PDF and then sharing it, you want to maintain the quality of the image. It also becomes highly convenient for the end-user to access the PDF file.There are a plethora of tools to convert JPG to PDF. Nonetheless, a tool that has gained a lot of trust in the segment is Adobe Acrobat. It simply converts any file from JPG to PDF without altering the quality. Moving ahead, we will step by step explain how you can use Adobe Acrobat to convert an image to PDF.Basic Definition of JPG and PDFJPG or JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, and it is mostly used for compressing highly detailed images, making them smaller for increasing their shareability. They are useful for sharing and storing digital images. The format is mostly used for adding images to blog posts, social media platforms, and emails.As for PDF, it includes a lot of things like images, official documents, degrees, etc. The best part about PDF is that it is a globally used format and can be easily accessed across all devices (being one of the most compatible as well).

Doordarshan will telecast live the Mangala, Shringaar, Rajbhog, Sandhya, and Shayan Aartis offered to the Ram Lalla idol at the Ayodhya Ram temple on DD National, connecting devotees who can't visit the temple. National broadcaster Doordarshan has good news for Lord Ram Devotees. Doordarshan has announced that it will telecast live the morning prayers offered to the Ram Lalla idol at the Ram Temple in Ayodhya every day.Doordarshan has shared the same in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Doordarshan said that the morning aarti offered to Ram Lalla will be telecast live on DD National every morning from 6:30 am.The national broadcaster said that the decision to telecast the morning aarti live every day was taken with the aim of connecting devotees of Lord Ram, especially after the temple was inaugurated less than two months ago in a grand ceremony and everyone can't visit the temple in person. The Aarti will be telecast simultaneously on DD’s YouTube channel also.Secondly, the decision was taken because the Trust doesn’t have logistical arrangements as of now for a live broadcast. Therefore, DD will be posting a two-three-member crew on the temple premises for the coverage of the daily ritual.DD's announcement to telecast the Aarti live for 30 minutes every morning comes after getting the go-ahead from the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust for the same. Initially, DD will air the “Mangala aarti” for a few months, and then, the Ram Temple Trust will take a call on how to take it forward.6 Aartis daily at the Ayodhya Ram templeThere are 6 aartis of Ram Lalla held daily in Ayodhya Ram temple. These include Mangala Aarti at 4:30 am, Shringaar Aarti at 6:30 am, Rajbhog Aarti at 12 noon, Utthapan Aarti at 2 pm, Sandhya Aarti at 7 pm, and Shayan Aarti at 10 pm.Giving directions to devotees for Aarti, the temple trust said, "Entry for Mangala Aarti at 4 AM, Shringar Aarti at 6:15 AM, and Shayan Aarti at 10 PM is possible only with an entry pass. No entry passes required for other Aartis."Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust advisory to devoteesIn an advisory to devotees coming for darshan at the temple, the Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra said, "Devotees can enter the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir for Darshan from 6:30 AM to 9:30 PM. The entire process from entry to exit after Darshan at the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir is extremely simple and convenient. Typically, devotees can have a smooth Darshan of Prabhu Shri Ram Lalla Sarkar within 60 to 75 minutes."The temple trust advised devotees to leave their mobile phones, footwear, purses and other personal items outside the Mandir premises for their convenience and to save time.It has also asked devotees not to bring flowers, garlands, Prasad to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

The design aims to eliminate the hinge crease and reduce the device's thickness while offering added benefits and durability. However, its practicality remains uncertain. Microsoft discontinues Surface Duo smartphones but files a patent for a new foldable device with a single hinge system called 'spine cover plate'. The design aims to eliminate the hinge crease and reduce the device's thickness while offering added benefits and durability. However, its practicality remains uncertain. Microsoft did not get the success it was anticipating with its Android-powered Surface Duo-series smartphones. The company has discontinued the lineup after the Duo 2. But, this does not mean the company has stopped trying. A new patent application filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29, reveals that the company is working on another foldable or dual-display mobile device.The patent application describes the company’s take on the foldable smartphone concept with single hinge technology called “spine cover plate”.Next Microsoft smartphones could feature a Galaxy Z Fold-like designAccording to the patent application, the phone could feature a “flexible display” in a bookstyle design similar to Galaxy Z Fold decies. However, the entire focus is on the spine cover plate mechanism which is aimed at protecting the single-hinge system of the device by covering the structural element. The differentiating factor between the regular hinge and Microsoft’s design is that the spine cover adjusts automatically during the opening and closing of the phone to prevent any unnecessary gaps around the hinge to protect it from dust as well as water. Currently, Samsung’s design offers an IPX8 rating which makes their foldables water-resistant only.The patent further mentions that the new hinge mechanism could allow Microsoft to eliminate the hinge crease less visible than the current options available in the market. Moreover, Microsoft has also mentioned techniques that could allow them to reduce the overall thickness of the foldable smartphone by allowing the spine cover plate to move closer to the device’s hinge when folded. “By retracting the spine cover plate toward the central spine as the first display-supporting frame and the second display-supporting frame are rotated into a face-to-face orientation, the width of the folded computing device is reduced, thereby enabling easier and more comfortable handling of the device, such as with one hand,” Microsoft noted in the patent.Interesting idea, but practicality is a question markThe entire smartphone market is searching for a way to eliminate the foldable crease from their smartphones. Some brands have already implemented the water-drop folding mechanism to reduce it, but there’s nothing like a crease-free foldable out there. Apart from that, the durability quotient of foldable is also important considering all the movable parts these phones have. That said, adding another layer or a movable part on top of the entire foldable mechanism does not appear like a wise move despite the added benefits and durability Microsoft has explained in the patent application.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Initiatives include partnering with the Election Commission, prioritizing trusted content on YouTube, and implementing advertising policies for transparency. Measures against AI-generated content are also taken. Google has announced a series of initiatives aimed at supporting the democratic process and safeguarding its platforms from abuse during the upcoming Indian General Election. With millions of eligible voters heading to the polls, the tech giant has said that recognises its responsibility to connect users with reliable information and counter the spread of misinformation, including AI-generated content.Easy access to voting information on Search and YouTubeGoogle has mentioned that its primary focus is on providing easy access to authoritative information from trusted sources.The company has also partnered with the Election Commission of India to showcase critical details on Google Search and YouTube, such as how to register and vote, in English and Hindi. Apart from this, YouTube’s recommendation system will prioritise trusted content during the election season. Additionally, YouTube’s homepage will prominently showcase trusted content along with an “Up Next” panel to make election-related details easily available for users. YouTube will also highlight content from trusted sources during key moments through its Top News and Breaking News as well as a news watch page. Moreover, the tech giant has also set up information panels that indicate funding sources from publishers that receive public or government funding and information panels that provide topical context for topics prone to misinformation. Safeguarding misinformationTo protect the integrity of the electoral process and to protect its products and services from abuse, Google has re-inforced its existing policies to keep its products and platforms safe while curbing misinformation at the same time. Also, the policies apply to all users, irrespective of the content type. The company has employed a combination of human reviewers and artificial intelligence models to identify and remove content that violates these policies. Google's AI capabilities are enhancing its abuse-fighting efforts, enabling faster action against emerging threats.Advertising during election campaignsTo keep things transparent when it comes to election advertising, the company requires advertisers to undergo identity verification and provide necessary certifications from the Election Commission. Election ads must also include disclosures indicating the advertiser's identity and location. Google maintains a searchable hub for all election ads, providing insights into the advertisers and their spending.Restricting AI-generated contentGoogle has also taken some steps to help identify AI-generated content through new tools and policies. The company has introduced disclosure requirements for election ads containing synthetic content and will soon require creators on YouTube to label realistic altered or synthetic content. The new ad policies prohibit the use of manipulated media to mislead people, like deepfakes or doctored content.Google has also implemented restrictions to Gemini on the types of election-related queries it will respond to and has also prioritised the provision of high-quality information. Additional features, such as the "About this Image" tool in Search and digital watermarking for AI-generated images, aim to provide users with context and assess credibility.Furthermore, Google has joined the C2PA coalition, a cross-industry effort to provide transparency and context for AI-generated content. The company has confirmed the deployment of technology to counter harmful AI-generated content aimed at deceiving voters during the 2024 elections.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

TSMC's stock rallied, elevating its market capitalisation to a record, making it higher than Broadcom. Analysts expect TSMC to further advance amid surging AI-related revenue and strong pricing power.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has reclaimed a spot in the list of the world’s 10 most valuable companies, riding the optimism of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom in the tech industry that pushed its stock to record levels.According to a report by Bloomberg, TSMC’s stock rallied 14% last week, elevating the chipmaker’s market capitalisation to a record, before a 2% decline in early trading on Monday (March 11), pared it to $634 billion. However, the decline didn’t impact the company much as it still has a market share higher than that of Broadcom, the report noted.What analysts have to sayAnalysts from Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. expect the semiconductor giant – that has Apple, Nvidia and Qualcomm as its customers – to advance further amid surging AI-related revenue and strong pricing power. “Generative AI semi is an obvious growth driver for TSMC,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Charlie Chan wrote in a note last week. The company’s overseas expansion also helps mitigate geopolitical concerns, they said.TSMC’s revenue gained 9.4% in the first two months of 2024 as demand for high-end chips increased due to a wave of activity in AI.Nvidia gets ‘AI boost’This is not the first time this year that a chip company has seen its stock on an upward spiral. This year, Nvidia was among the companies that got a boost by a frenzy around generative AI.In the last month, Nvidia stock price has risen over 20% while in the last six months, it has risen over 90%. Moreover, in the last one year, Nvidia stock price has appreciated from $234.36 per share level to $875.28 per share mark – registering a 275% jump.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

The update combines gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer data, reducing magnetic interference and benefiting Google Maps and third-party apps on Android 5.0 or above. Google Maps is updating its Fused Orientation Provider (FOP) API to improve direction accuracy in busy areas. The update combines gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer data, reducing magnetic interference and benefiting Google Maps and third-party apps on Android 5.0 or above. We keep hearing about Google Maps fiasco from across the globe where it directed people in some odd direction and eventually got them stuck in a ‘worst case scenario’. Now a new post published on the Android Developers blog gives an insight about Maps getting a new update to better with directions. The post talks about a potential upgrade that Maps will be getting with the Fused Orientation Provider (FOP) API that aims to make the ‘orientation’ detection better on Android devices, irrespective of the hardware used by different OEMs on their devices. According to the post, the update will make Maps interpret the directions better to make it more accurate by combining the gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer data. However, this idea of Google using data from all the sensors isn’t new, the company has used the API before, but the update will make better magnetic interference. As per the post, the changes will not only apply to Google Maps but also third-party apps that rely on Google Maps to offer navigational data. It is to be noted that the update will be done with internals of the Google Maps, it won’t affect the user interface or the layout of the app. Also, the updated API will be rolled out from the server side or via the app update in Android devices running Android 5.0 or above. How it will affect usersAs mentioned, the update won’t change anything in terms of the app’s design or user interface. The changes are internal in the form of API which will be pushed automatically via the update. That said, the update is set to make it better with directions, especially in busy areas.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Musk announces xAI open sourcing Grok chatbot. OpenAI CEO Altman takes a dig at Musk's chatbot. Musk, obviously didn't like the jab and replied with a long-ish message saying “GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.”  Elon Musk has been extremely critical of ChatGPT maker OpenAI for deviating from its mission to develop AI for the benefit of humanity and taking a profit-making path. He has advocated that artificial intelligence (AI) should be accessible for all, and he has now announced that his AI startup xAI will open source Grok chatbot this week.“This week, @xAI will open source Grok,” Musk said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).In simpler words, open-sourcing a software, like a chatbot, means that the software projects are redistributable as all source code is accessible by everyone. One of the advantages of having open source software is that it provides flexibility to an enterprise to have multiple ways of fixing a problem rather than waiting for an internal team to provide a solution.“OpenAI is a lie”Meanwhile, a user suggested that OpenAI should do the same.“OpenAI should do the same if they are ‘open’ that is,” the user said. Musk replied, “OpenAI is a lie.”Musk wants AI technology to be open-source Musk had floated the idea of open-sourcing AI during a podcast in November last year. In a podcast with Lex Fridman, Musk suggested that he likes the idea of open-source AI. “I am generally in favour of open sourcing, like biassed towards open sourcing,” he said.His comments came soon after his AI company called xAI released Grok, its chatbot, which reportedly took four months to build. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was quick to take a dig at this and shared a post in which he built Grok with a single prompt on GPT Builder."GPTs can save a lot of effort:” he said.Musk, obviously didn't like the jab and replied with a long-ish message saying “GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.” About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Ruby Johnson filed a lawsuit against Detective Gary Staab and Sgt. Gregory Buschy.  Apple's Find My app has cost the city of Denver, US $3.76 million in compensation and damages. In 2022, the city’s police wrongly raided and ransacked an elderly woman's home looking for a stolen truck and guns. According to a report by CNN, Denver police were seeking to recover a stolen truck loaded with guns, ammo and cash. For this, the police used Apple's Find My technology on another iPhone to locate the vehicle.However, the police picked the wrong house out of a fairly wide area to storm in and catch the thieves. Due to this misplaced raid, 78-year-old Ruby Johnson filed a lawsuit against the police. As compensation, the city will be paying Johnson a $3.76 million award. Moreover, the defendant officers — Detective Gary Staab and Sgt. Gregory Buschy — were also sued as an individual. Denver police had previously cleared both men of wrongdoing, but the jury disagreed.How Apple’s Find My app played a roleThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) brought the case on behalf of Johnson. The lawsuit mentioned that the raid was conducted based on an “alleged location ping from an iPhone's Find My app that the officers did not understand and for which they had no training." As per the complaint, the police relied on a "Find My" ping from an iPhone 11 that was probably still in the stolen truck. However, the area identified included parts of six other properties across parts of four city blocks.In a statement, Johnson's attorney Tim Macdonald said: “We are disturbed by the lack of training or policy changes and hope that the amount of the punitive damages award will send a strong message that the police department must take seriously the constitutional rights of its residents.” The ACLU and the jury concluded that the two police officers who ordered the raid had no reason to single out Johnson's house as the target. Also, the officers have to pay nearly $1.25 million each in punitive and compensatory damages. A Denver District Court clerk noted that the city has not yet filed an appeal of the verdict.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

A bill to sell TikTok is introduced, backed by President Biden. Kotick discussed acquisition with OpenAI head. Activision Blizzard faced a lawsuit. Concerns about data privacy and ties to China persist. TikTok urges American users to support it.  Bobby Kotick, the former head of Activision Blizzard, is reportedly considering buying TikTok, as the app could be banned in the United States. The Wall Street Journal reports that Kotick has talked to ByteDance, the company that owns TikTok, about buying the app, which could cost hundreds of billions of dollars.This comes as US lawmakers introduce a new bill that would make ByteDance sell TikTok within six months or stop it from being available in US app stores.President Joe Biden has said he would approve the bill if it passes in Congress.The Wall Street Journal report adds that Kotick, the head of OpenAI, Sam Altman, discussed teaming up to buy TikTok at a dinner last week. Kotick's interest in TikTok follows a rough end to his 30 years leading Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft acquired last year. The company faced a lawsuit saying it allowed sexual harassment and discrimination under Kotick's leadership. The Wall Street Journal also said Kotick knew about bad behaviour and didn't tell the board everything. Kotick was accused of harassment, but Activision Blizzard said the report was "misleading."Lawmakers are worried about data privacy and TikTok's ties to China. US President Biden, whose administration has banned the app already on state devices, has expressed his support for banning the app in the US. However, former President Donald Trump, who once wanted to ban TikTok, has changed his mind, saying a ban would help TikTok's rivals, like Facebook and YouTube. As the bill against TikTok gains support, the app has asked its American users to speak up for it, sending messages telling users to call their representatives. The bill, which passed a committee last week, is expected to be approved when the House votes on Wednesday. If it passes, it will then go to the Senate, and then the bill will be signed by the President of the US.Former Activision boss reportedly wants to buy TikTokAbout the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Reason is said to be delay in the delivery of two supercomputers by the French company to Indian weather forecasting institutes. According to a report in news agency PTI, the Earth Sciences Ministry had ordered two supercomputers worth $100 million from French firm Eviden, of the Atos Group, last year to enhance the computing capabilities of its institutions -- the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM)."I am more upset because the target we set was December. The Union Cabinet had already approved purchasing the supercomputer. We have only four petaflop capacity. We want to install up to 18 petaflop capacity," Rijiju told PTI in a video interview.He said that the French company ran into some financial trouble and wanted the government to make payment to its subsidiary.Minister says that the delay is causing him "worry"Rijiju said that the delay has caused him lots of worry as the company has overshot the timeline. "But I think we will sort it out soon," he said, adding that the government wanted to be "very correct in our position legally"."We are ready to release the money because we want the machine immediately. The only problem is the amount is not small. So if we pay now, if the company is bankrupt or something happens, who will bail out," the minister said.Rijiju further added that the government was taking some steps to speed up the delivery of the supercomputer but did not elaborate. "But I hope the French government will also intervene because we have a good understanding and a very good relationship with the French government."Since it is a high-cost equipment, we want to ensure that the transaction happens duly and properly," he said."From outside, everything's ready. It is only the problem with the main company. They want us to pay their subsidiary. We will pay only to a company whom we have entered an MoU with," Rijiju said.The supercomputing system, based on Eviden's BullSequana XH2000, is said to have a combined power capacity of up to 21.3 petaflops.Supercomputer at IITMThe supercomputer at the Pune-based IITM will provide 13 petaflops of computing power for atmosphere and climate research. As per the PTI report, it will integrate 3,000 CPU nodes using AMD EPYC 7643 processors and 26 GPU nodes through NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. The system will benefit from the NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand networking platform with In-Network Computing, 3PB all flash and 29PB disk-based DDN EXAScaler ES400NVX2 storage and Micron high-technology memory.The existing computing facility at NCMRWF is 2.8 petaflops and at IITM is 4 petaflops, respectively.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Dhillon declared “Our medical system is broken” in defense of foreign-trained doctors, she ignited more than an immigration debate. Her remarks spotlighted entrenched flaws in U.S. medical education — from capped residency slots to crushing debt — and reignited a data-driven question: is America’s physician shortage a visa problem, or a homegrown policy failure? (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) It is not every day that a comment about visas rips open a conversation about the way America trains its doctors. But that's exactly what happened when Harmeet K. Dhillon, an India-born attorney and former Trump administration official, said in a X post that, “Our medical system is broken.” She was backing foreign-trained physicians and the H-1B pathway, but her words did more than wade into an immigration fight. But her words did more than wade into an immigration fight. They put the spotlight on a system that moulds who ends up in white coats, and who is left waiting in exam rooms across the country. The debate now isn’t whether Dhillon’s remark was provocative; it is whether it dug up the real picture or is just a political hyperbole.What Dhillon actually said — and why it mattersDhillon anchored her case in personal history: her father, she said, “was the only orthopedic surgeon for over 15 years in a rural North Carolina farming county,” an example, she argued, of how foreign-trained physicians fill geographic gaps. She warned against “scapegoating” immigrant doctors and laid blame instead on what she called ideological and admissions failures in US medical education. Dhillon’s case stems from a personal history. Her father, she said, “was the only orthopedic surgeon for over 15 years in a rural North Carolina farming county,” an example, she argued, of how foreign-trained physicians fill geographic gaps.Her comments ran alongside Republican Congressman Greg Murphy’s blunt endorsement of H-1B reliance for clinicians: “H1-B Visas are critical for helping alleviate the severe physician shortage this nation faces. We cannot train enough American Doctors fast enough.”Those two sentences — one moral and anecdotal, the other instrumental and blunt, frame opposing but related claims: (a) immigrant physicians are critical today; (b) the US training pipeline is failing to produce enough clinicians to meet demand. Both are empirically testable.Loopholes in the American education systemUS medical education remains globally respected for its research output and clinical training, but the pathway from student to practicing physician is riddled with structural loopholes. Chief among them is the federal cap on Medicare-funded residency slots unchanged since the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which limits graduate medical education positions despite a steady rise in medical school enrollment, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges according to Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) report 2023. As a result, hundreds of qualified graduates each year fail to secure residency placements, leaving them unable to practice despite holding MD degrees. Tuition costs further worsen the problem: The median debt for medical school graduates in 2022 was $200,000 according to AAMC data released in 2022, a burden that pushes many toward higher-paying subspecialties rather than primary care. This trend deepens shortages in rural and underserved communities, where the Health Resources and Services Administration projects a shortfall of more than 17,000 primary care physicians by 2035 according to Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), 2023. With only 155 accredited MD-granting institutions in the country, the system’s bottlenecks mean the pace of producing new doctors is dictated less by student ability than by outdated policy and economic pressure.Can education alone fix the health system of America?As Dhillon’s remark circles around the fractures in the American education system, the question that comes to the forefront is, can it be the mend as well? Independent, peer-reviewed benchmarking leaves little room for spin. The Commonwealth Fund’s comparative analysis places the United States at the bottom of wealthy-country peers on overall health system performance, a finding driven by poor outcomes, uneven access, and equity shortfalls despite far higher spending per capita. In short, the system gives value for money. Harvard Health’s report speaks of the system’s failures, excessive cost, baffling complexity, and perverse incentives that favour procedures over prevention. It reads like why education alone cannot cater to the education health of America.Training good doctors matters, but so do payment systems, primary-care capacity, insurance design and social determinants of health. The choke point nobody in academe likes to discuss: Residency slotsYou can increase medical-school seats, but the bottleneck after graduation is residency training, the controlled, accredited apprenticeship that actually produces practicing physicians. Medicare’s historical funding rules created a residency “cap” based on the number of slots a hospital trained in 1996; hospitals that wish to expand must find other money or wait for policy changes. That structural limit has long been a rate-limiting step for domestic physician supply. The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) report issued in April 2025, projects continuing physician shortfalls even under optimistic scenarios: Recent AAMC analysis forecasts shortages on the order of tens of thousands of doctors in the coming decade without sustained policy change. Incrementing medical-school capacity without commensurate residency expansion, or incentives to keep graduates in clinical care and primary care, will not close the gap quickly.Foreign-trained physicians: The stop-gap with moral and practical complicationsInternational medical graduates (IMGs) are not marginal or sidelined players. IMGs fill a disproportionate share of primary-care and rural posts; data show they represented roughly one quarter of the physician workforce and account for a substantial share of first-year residency matches. This is like a lightning fact that trimming off immigrant participation from the equation would produce immediate harm in undeserved communities.But relying on that stop gap raises two ethical questions: Is it fair to recruit physicians from countries that already have shortages, and does it let the US off the hook for fixing its own system? Both answers matter to education policymakers drafting a sustainable long-term strategy.Where the evidence pushes policy, not slogansIf we accept the empirical frame, system underperformance, workforce shortfalls, and IMGs filling urgent gaps, then the policy menu begins to look familiar but practical:Expand funded residency positions at scale. Congressional steps to add Medicare-supported GME slots have precedent and direct impact; policy levers here accelerate clinicians into practice faster than doubling pre-clinical seats alone.Retool incentives toward primary care and rural service. Compensation, administrative relief, and loan forgiveness tied to service in shortage areas shift career choices back toward community medicine, where shortages bite hardest. Synchronize admissions, capacity, and workforce planning. Increasing first-year matriculants without matching residency and clinical placement capacity is incomplete reform; workforce modelling must be the linchpin. Protect clinical competence while modernizing curricula. Teaching about sex, gender, and social determinants improves care for marginalized patients when done alongside rigorous biomedical training — and should not be weaponised as proof that schools have abandoned science.Ready to navigate global policies?

Krishna Janmashtami, celebrating Lord Krishna’s birth on August 16, 2025, is observed nationwide with devotion and rituals. However, the declaration of a public holiday varies by state, with some closing schools and offices while others maintain regular schedules. This inconsistency requires individuals to confirm holiday status locally each year.

Check details hereTOI Education / Updated: Aug 11, 2025, 13:06 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLargeKrishna Janmashtami, celebrating Lord Krishna’s birth on August 16, 2025, is observed nationwide with devotion and rituals. However, the declaration of a public holiday varies by state, with some closing schools and offices while others maintain regular schedules. This inconsistency requires individuals to confirm holiday status locally each year.  Krishna Janmashtami, the revered festival commemorating the birth of Lord Krishna, will fall on Saturday, August 16, 2025. This day is marked by fervent devotion, cultural pageantry, and elaborate rituals across the country, especially in sacred regions such as Mathura and Vrindavan, which hold profound mythological significance as the cradle of Krishna’s life and legacy.Despite Janmashtami’s unifying spiritual importance nationwide, the designation of a public holiday for schools, colleges, and government institutions on this day is far from uniform. The observance of Janmashtami as a holiday remains a state prerogative rather than a centralized mandate. Consequently, the landscape of closures varies widely, reflecting India’s federal administrative complexity and regional cultural priorities.States declaring a holiday on JanmashtamiIn several states, the day is recognized as an official holiday, prompting the closure of educational institutions, banks, and government offices. States including Gujarat (Ahmedabad), Odisha (Bhubaneswar), Tamil Nadu (Chennai), Uttarakhand (Dehradun), Sikkim (Gangtok), Telangana and Andhra Pradesh (Hyderabad), Rajasthan (Jaipur), Uttar Pradesh (Kanpur and Lucknow), West Bengal (Kolkata), Bihar (Patna), Chhattisgarh (Raipur), Jharkhand (Ranchi), Meghalaya (Shillong), and Himachal Pradesh (Shimla) have traditionally observed Janmashtami with official holidays.This allowance enables students and citizens alike to immerse themselves fully in religious festivities and cultural programmes dedicated to Krishna. In schools, celebrations often include devotional music, dramatic reenactments of Krishna’s childhood episodes, and traditional dances. Such observances play an educational role, fostering cultural continuity and imparting moral narratives associated with the deity.States without a Janmashtami holidayConversely, in several other states and key metropolitan regions, Janmashtami does not translate into an official holiday. Cities such as Agartala (Tripura), Aizawl (Mizoram), Belapur (Maharashtra), Belagavi and Bengaluru (Karnataka), Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh), Guwahati (Assam), Imphal (Manipur), Itanagar (Arunachal Pradesh), Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram (Kerala), Kohima (Nagaland), Mumbai and Nagpur (Maharashtra), New Delhi (NCT), and Panaji (Goa) typically maintain regular working schedules on this day.In these regions, while the festival is culturally acknowledged, the absence of a formal holiday underscores regional administrative decisions that prioritize other factors, including differing demographic compositions and economic considerations. Schools and institutions in these areas may host scaled-down events or allow individual participation without closing.A call for clarityThe variability in holiday declarations for Krishna Janmashtami often leads to confusion among students, parents, and working professionals. Since neither the Central Government nor many state administrations issue uniform, official notifications, local authorities and individual institutions retain discretion over holiday observance. This fragmented approach necessitates stakeholders to verify schedules directly with their schools, colleges, or employers well in advance.Ready to navigate global policies?

How Trump’s executive order could reshape college admissions and campus diversity across the US
The Trump administration’s executive order mandates universities to publicly disclose applicants’ race, test scores, and GPAs, intensifying debates over fairness and diversity in college admissions. Following the Supreme Court’s ban on race-based admissions, the policy may push schools toward test-score-focused decisions, potentially disadvantaging low-income and minority students, while reshaping how merit and diversity are balanced nationwide.

Following the Supreme Court’s ban on race-based admissions, the policy may push schools toward test-score-focused decisions, potentially disadvantaging low-income and minority students, while reshaping how merit and diversity are balanced nationwide.  The Trump administration recently issued an executive order requiring universities to publicly disclose detailed information about the race, test scores, and grade point averages of all applicants. This move intensifies an already heated national debate over college admissions, meritocracy, and campus diversity. According to The New York Times, the new data disclosure rules aim to increase transparency but could also shift admissions practices in ways that affect student diversity across the country’s most selective institutions.A century-long debate over admissions For more than a century, colleges have grappled with the question of how to admit students fairly. The controversy touches on fundamental issues such as equal opportunity, racial justice, and the definition of merit. Traditionally, many colleges have used holistic admissions processes that consider applicants’ life experiences, including race and socio-economic background, to build diverse and inclusive campuses. However, conservative groups argue that such subjective criteria can lead to unfair advantages for certain groups and discrimination against others, particularly white and Asian students.Supreme Court ruling and new federal requirements In 2023, the Supreme Court ruled that considering race in admissions decisions was unconstitutional. This ruling forced universities to overhaul their admissions policies to comply with the new legal framework. Building on that decision, the Trump administration’s executive order now requires colleges to report applicant data to a federal database called the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). Education Secretary Linda McMahon emphasised that this data will help the public see whether colleges admit students based on merit or race, stating, according to The New York Times, it “will enable the American public to assess whether schools are passing over the most qualified students in favor of others based on their race.”The pressure to prioritise test scoresAccording to The New York Times, experts warn that this focus on quantitative measures like test scores and grade point averages could unintentionally favour wealthier students who often have access to better preparation and resources from an early age. James Murphy, director of postsecondary policy at Education Reform Now, told The New York Times, “I think the incentives that this creates are a big deal. It is creating pressure on colleges to focus on higher G.P.A.s and higher test scores.”The history and impact of standardised testing The use of standardised test scores in admissions has a complex history. In the early 20th century, colleges prioritised intangible qualities such as character, leadership, and athletic ability. These factors sometimes served as barriers for certain groups, including Jewish students. After World War II, as the United States faced global competition, universities shifted focus towards academic metrics like the SAT. However, this shift has been challenged by civil rights advocates seeking more inclusive admissions policies.Income and racial disparities in test scores Research highlighted by The New York Times shows significant disparities in test scores tied to family income. For example, students from affluent households are seven times more likely to score at least 1300 on the SAT compared to those from low-income families. Among the high school class of 2024, just 1% of Black students and 2% of Hispanic students scored between 1400 and 1600, the highest SAT range. By contrast, 7% of white students and 27% of Asian students reached that score bracket. Admissions beyond test scores Given these disparities, very few elite colleges admit students solely based on test scores today. They also consider legacy status, special talents, and economic adversity to create a more balanced student body. Boston University professor Anthony Abraham Jack told The New York Times that the new order could push admissions towards a “quota system for wealthy and white students.” He cautioned, “If your class is too brown, too poor, then somehow you rigged the system.” Jack stressed the importance of context in evaluating applicants, telling The New York Times, “If you have a student who gets a 5 in A.P. calculus, that doesn’t give you a relative understanding of how good they are. What if they’re the only young woman in the entire state to get a 5 in A.P. calc? That tells you how amazing that person is.”What this means for students As the admissions landscape shifts, students and families may find it harder or easier to understand what it takes to gain entry into selective colleges. The Trump administration’s push for more standardised, data-driven admissions decisions may narrow the path for many, especially students from diverse and disadvantaged backgrounds. The debate continues as universities strive to balance fairness, diversity, and academic excellence in an evolving legal and political environment.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

While framed as a push to shift control from Washington, critics warn federal influence remains entrenched. The tour’s success hinges on whether it sparks real policy change or remains symbolic. Image representation: (AP) The rhetoric from Washington is bold: Education should be shaped by states, not dictated by the federal government. Now, US Secretary of Education Linda McMahon is taking that message on the road, launching a “Returning Education to the States” Tour that will cover all 50 states.Kicking off next week in Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee, McMahon says the mission is simple: Listen to the people closest to the classroom. “President Trump entrusted me with a vital mission to return education to the states,” she said, pledging to spotlight local innovations and give families “the freedom to choose the educational path that best fits their child’s needs.”The politics behind the promiseThis is more than a travel itinerary. It is an unmistakable signal that the Trump administration intends to position education policy as a states’ rights issue. The tour could be read as an early move in reshaping the post-pandemic education landscape, where debates over school choice, funding, and federal mandates are sharpening.But there’s a catch. Returning education to the states is not simply a matter of goodwill tours and listening sessions. The federal government’s influence, through funding strings, compliance rules, and national testing requirements, has been cemented over decades. Without rewriting those rules, any shift risks being cosmetic.Choice, innovation… and inequity?McMahon’s emphasis on school choice plays well with advocates of charter schools and vouchers, but critics warn that devolving control without robust guardrails could deepen inequalities. States with more resources could race ahead, while others struggle to maintain even baseline standards. The result could be a patchwork system where a student’s zip code dictates opportunity more than talent or effort.Listening is only the first mileFor all its symbolism, the tour will be judged by its outcomes. Will it lead to legislation that gives states more autonomy over curricula, testing, and funding distribution? Will federal oversight be meaningfully scaled back? Or will the findings be folded into speeches without touching the policy levers that matter?The real test of McMahon’s 50-state journey is whether it delivers a structural handover of power, or just a well-choreographed show of federal humility. The classrooms she visits may hold the answers, but Washington still holds the keys.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future.

While automation may replace many jobs, it opens unprecedented opportunities like solo billion-dollar startups, space exploration careers, and new industries. Success will hinge on adaptability, lifelong learning, and mastering AI-powered tools.  In a recent interview with Cleo Abram titled "Sam Altman Shows Me GPT-5... And What’s Next", Sam Altman, the chief executive officer (CEO) of OpenAI, shared a striking perspective about the future facing today’s college graduates. With artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly evolving and transforming industries, the looming question for many young students is what the job market will look like when they enter the workforce. In the interview, it was mentioned that reports indicate AI could replace nearly half of entry-level white-collar jobs within five years. Yet, Altman offers an optimistic viewpoint, describing this generation of graduates as possibly the luckiest in history.Sam Altman Shows Me GPT 5... And What's NextAI and the changing landscape of workThe landscape of work is undeniably changing. AI systems are automating routine tasks across sectors such as finance, customer service, and even creative industries. For students graduating today, this forecast suggests a future different from that of previous generations.However, history shows that technological advancements often lead to the disappearance of some roles but simultaneously create new jobs, industries, and fields of study. The crucial factor for success lies in adaptability and willingness to learn new skills. Altman recognises this reality but highlights that young people are inherently better equipped to navigate such transitions.Careers beyond imaginationDuring the interview, Altman imagined the distant future of 2035, describing a world where college graduates might be embarking on extraordinary careers beyond current comprehension. “What are the things that we could look ahead if we’re thinking about in 2035 that like graduating college students, if they still go to college at all, could very well be like leaving on a mission to explore the solar system on a spaceship in some kind of completely new exciting, super well-paid, super interesting job. I'm feeling so bad for you and I that we had to do this kind of like really boring old kind of work and everything is just better,” he said.This vision reflects a shift from the traditional work paradigm to one where innovation and exploration become central. For many students, the jobs they will pursue may not even exist yet. This uncertainty can be daunting, but it also offers a landscape rich with possibility.Empowerment through AI tools and entrepreneurshipCloser to the present, Altman points out how AI has dramatically lowered the barriers to entrepreneurship and creation. “I think it is probably possible now to start a company that is a one-person company that will go on to be worth like more than a billion dollars and more importantly than that deliver an amazing product and service to the world and that is like a crazy thing,” he noted. The accessibility of AI-powered tools means that tasks once requiring hundreds of employees can now be achieved by a single individual with the right expertise and creativity.For students in 2025, this means the conventional pathways to success are evolving. Learning how to leverage AI tools, whether for software development, content creation, data analysis, or other domains, is becoming a critical skill. Universities and educational institutions are increasingly integrating AI literacy and digital fluency into their curricula. This equips students not only to find jobs but also to create them.The importance of adaptability and lifelong learningAltman’s concern is less about the young graduate and more about those in later stages of their careers who may resist change. “I’m more worried about what it means, not for the like 22-year-old, but for the 62-year-old that doesn’t want to go retrain or reskill,” he mentioned. This distinction underlines the urgency for lifelong learning and flexibility in career planning.Despite fears of disruption, Altman’s message to students is clear: This is a remarkable time to be entering the workforce. The tools available today allow for creativity and impact on a scale never before possible. The future will require a new kind of literacy that combines technical knowledge, adaptability, and an entrepreneurial mindset.Preparing for a transformative eraIn 2025, students looking ahead should take note of these insights. The traditional model of graduating and moving directly into a stable, entry-level position may be rare. Instead, many may find themselves pursuing portfolios of projects, starting ventures, or collaborating with AI systems to generate value. The skills to navigate this new ecosystem include problem-solving, critical thinking, and digital competence.The coming decade will be one of rapid transformation. AI-driven innovation will disrupt but also empower. Altman’s perspective encourages students to embrace this change and seize the unique opportunities it presents.For students who are open to exploring new domains and learning continuously, the future holds the promise of meaningful, well-paid, and exciting work. Whether this means joining space exploration efforts, creating pioneering technologies, or launching solo startups worth billions, the AI era is shaping a workforce that is as dynamic as it is unprecedented.Sam Altman’s reflections, grounded in his leadership role at OpenAI, remind us that despite uncertainties, young graduates today truly are the luckiest in history. They stand at the threshold of a future where human ingenuity combined with AI can redefine the limits of possibility.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

These highly specialised roles demand advanced mathematical expertise, rare technical skills, and years of research—offering multi-million-dollar packages to drive the company’s AI ambitions.  A recent Wall Street Journal report has revealed the intensity of Meta’s latest recruitment push, targeting the upper echelon of artificial intelligence researchers. At the centre of the effort is a carefully compiled roster, internally referred to as “The List”, featuring some of the most accomplished professionals in the field.These individuals are not ordinary hires; they are often PhD graduates from institutions like the University of California, Berkeley, and Carnegie Mellon University. Many have worked at the world’s most influential AI labs, including OpenAI in San Francisco and Google DeepMind in London. Their work revolves around solving technical problems of extraordinary complexity, requiring vast computing resources and a rare blend of mathematical and engineering skills.What “The List” looks forAccording to WSJ, The List prioritises researchers with advanced qualifications in AI-related disciplines, a strong command of calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory, and a portfolio of significant contributions to machine learning and algorithmic design.The recruitment process goes beyond scanning CVs. It includes analysing academic publications, tracking major AI breakthroughs, and strategically approaching candidates through direct channels such as email, messaging apps, and professional networks.Why are salaries reaching the stratosphereThe competition for AI talent has reached levels that mirror an arms race. Meta’s offers, often in the multi-million-dollar range, are designed to lure specialists who can accelerate the company’s ambitions in building advanced AI systems.One striking example is Alexandr Wang, founder of Scale AI, whose company secured a $14 billion investment from Meta. At 28, Wang is now leading key aspects of Meta’s AI development, illustrating the scale of investment the company is willing to commit to secure the right expertise.Pressure on competitorsThe WSJ report notes that Meta’s strategy has placed significant pressure on rivals, especially OpenAI. Sources indicate that multiple researchers have been approached, prompting OpenAI to revise its compensation structures. In one instance, internal communications urged employees not to be swayed by competing offers, underscoring how valuable these researchers have become.The degree that opens the doorFor those aspiring to join this elite circle, the entry point is clear but demanding: Advanced academic training in AI-focused fields. PhDs in machine learning, computer science, applied mathematics, or computational neuroscience form the backbone of the qualifications sought.These programmes demand years of research, deep mathematical expertise, and the ability to contribute to the global body of AI knowledge. The skill set is so rare that it commands salaries capable of transforming careers, and bank accounts.A small world with high stakesThe AI research community is tightly connected. Many leading figures know each other personally, sharing job offers and industry news in private Slack and Discord channels. This interconnectedness means a recruitment move by one company can trigger ripple effects across the sector, as competing firms rush to protect their own talent pools.From equations to earningsThe Wall Street Journal’s reporting makes it evident: In the AI era, mastery of mathematics is no longer just an academic achievement, it’s a commercial asset of extraordinary value. Those who can design algorithms, manipulate data models, and drive AI innovation are shaping the future of technology while securing earnings that rival the highest-paying industries in the world.For the next generation of students and researchers, the message is clear: The road to a multi-million-dollar role in companies like Meta may well begin with a rigorous degree, and an exceptional command of the language of machines.Ready to navigate global policies?

Once-promising US computer science graduates now face shrinking entry-level job prospects as AI tools automate coding and hiring. Layoffs at major tech firms, AI-driven resume screenings, and an “AI loop” of automated applications and rejections have left many struggling to secure work. The future demands adaptability, AI literacy now outweighs traditional programming skills for breaking into the industry.

Layoffs at major tech firms, AI-driven resume screenings, and an “AI loop” of automated applications and rejections have left many struggling to secure work. The future demands adaptability, AI literacy now outweighs traditional programming skills for breaking into the industry.  In 2012, Microsoft’s senior executive Brad Smith told the world that computer science graduates could expect six-figure salaries, generous hiring bonuses, and stock grants straight out of college, according to The New York Times. The pitch, echoed by billionaires, tech executives, and US presidents, was simple: Learn to code, and a secure, lucrative career awaited. Thirteen years later, that once-shiny promise is fading. The spread of artificial intelligence programming tools, which can generate and debug code within seconds, is reshaping the entry-level tech job market. Combined with sweeping layoffs at companies such as Amazon, Intel, Meta, and Microsoft, the shift is leaving many recent computer science graduates struggling to secure their first positions. The end of a golden pipeline The dream began in the early 2010s, when political leaders and industry giants pushed coding as the skill that would strengthen both individual job prospects and the national economy. Universities expanded computer science programs to meet the demand, and the number of undergraduates majoring in the subject in the United States more than doubled between 2014 and 2024, according to the Computing Research Association. Yet today, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reports that unemployment among recent computer science graduates stands at 6.1%, more than twice the rate for biology or art history majors. For computer engineering graduates, the rate is even higher at 7.5%. Jeff Forbes, a former program director for computer science education at the National Science Foundation, told The New York Times that just a few years ago, graduates could “fight off offers from top firms,” whereas now they are struggling to land any job at all.A hiring process without humans For many graduates, the challenge lies not only in the shortage of openings but also in how hiring processes have evolved. Entry-level roles are often the first to be automated, according to Matthew Martin, a senior economist at Oxford Economics, as reported by The New York Times. Employers increasingly rely on AI systems to scan resumes, reject candidates, and even conduct early interview screenings, often without human oversight. Graduates are trying to adapt by using AI tools themselves, automating resume tailoring and application submissions. But this has created what some call an “AI loop”: Applicants use algorithms to apply, while employers use algorithms to reject. As The New York Times reported, some students receive rejections within minutes of applying.Personal stories of a broken promise Purdue University graduate Manasi Mishra told The New York Times she applied for tech jobs for a year and received only one interview offer, from Chipotle. Oregon State graduate Zach Taylor sent out 5,762 applications and was rejected from all of them. Others, like Clark University’s Audrey Roller, found that rejection emails sometimes arrived just three minutes after submission. These experiences have left many feeling “gaslit” about their futures. Students who once believed coding was a guaranteed ticket to stability now face a market that values AI literacy over traditional programming skills — skills that many universities only recently began teaching.Shifting priorities towards AI In response, major players are pivoting. Microsoft has pledged $4 billion for AI training initiatives, and national policies are beginning to focus on preparing students for AI-related roles. But for those graduating now, these changes offer little immediate relief. As 2025 unfolds, the message to future computer science students may no longer be “just learn to code.” Instead, it is becoming a lesson in adaptability: Learn to work alongside AI, understand its tools and limits, and prepare for a career where the entry-level gateway is no longer guaranteed. The story of how AI reshapes this generation’s career paths is still being written. For many, the first chapter is a harsh awakening from the promise they were sold in high school, a promise that technology would always need them.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

Trump demands $1 billion from UCLA over antisemitism claims: Here's why California says it's political
US President Donald Trump's administration is demanding a $1 billion settlement from UCLA over alleged civil rights violations tied to antisemitism. The DOJ claims UCLA failed to protect Jewish students during 2024 protests. California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, called the demand politically motivated. The case follows similar settlements with Columbia and Brown universities. UCLA has already settled a related lawsuit for $6 million and introduced new measures to address antisemitism and campus safety.

The case follows similar settlements with Columbia and Brown universities. UCLA has already settled a related lawsuit for $6 million and introduced new measures to address antisemitism and campus safety. cseeks $1 billion from UCLA over antisemitism claims as California pushes back The administration of US President Donald Trump is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), following accusations from the Department of Justice (DOJ) that the university violated federal civil rights laws by failing to address antisemitic incidents on campus. A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the demand, as reported by the Associated Press.UCLA is the first public university to face such a large-scale financial penalty amid the Trump administration's broader push to reform higher education institutions it claims are failing to uphold civil rights protections. Federal funding for UCLA was suspended earlier, totalling $584 million, according to university officials.DOJ cites violation of civil rights law and the Fourteenth AmendmentAccording to a DOJ finding issued on July 29, UCLA violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by “acting with deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students,” as reported by the Associated Press.The allegations stem largely from the university's handling of protests related to the 2024 Israel-Hamas war. During one night of unrest, counterprotesters attacked a pro-Palestinian encampment on UCLA's campus, resulting in several injuries before police intervened hours later. Over 200 individuals were arrested the following day after refusing orders to disband. Jewish students reported being blocked from campus areas and classrooms by demonstrators.California officials respond to $1 billion demandCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom accused the Trump administration of using financial threats for political purposes. Speaking to reporters, he said, “He has threatened us through extortion with a billion-dollar fine unless we do his bidding,” as quoted by the Associated Press. He contrasted California's response with settlements reached by private institutions, stating, “We will not be like some of those other institutions that have followed a different path.”James B. Milliken, president of the University of California, said the university had “just received” the DOJ document and would review it. He noted that such a settlement “would completely devastate our country's greatest public university system,” as reported by the Associated Press. Milliken, who recently assumed office, stated the university had offered to engage in a “good faith dialogue” with the DOJ.Settlements with other universities set precedentThe Trump administration has already reached civil rights settlements with other institutions, including $50 million from Brown University and $221 million from Columbia University. Columbia also regained access to over $400 million in research grants. Negotiations with Harvard University are ongoing, with the administration reportedly pressing for a larger settlement.UCLA previously settled separate civil rights lawsuitLast week, UCLA reached a $6 million settlement in a civil rights lawsuit filed by three Jewish students and a Jewish professor. The university also committed $2.3 million to organisations addressing antisemitism and supporting its Jewish community. As part of broader reforms, UCLA established an Office of Campus and Community Safety and introduced new systemwide protest guidelines.As reported by the Associated Press, Chancellor Julio Frenk, whose family history includes Holocaust survivors, also launched an initiative aimed at combating antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias on campus.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

Trump hands political appointees control over science funding: Here’s why researchers are sounding the alarm
President Trump's executive order gives political appointees control over federal science grants, requiring agencies like NIH and NSF to ensure funding aligns with political priorities. Grants can be terminated anytime, raising concerns among researchers about political interference in scientific funding. The order delays new funding announcements and threatens projects on health and public safety. Experts warn this could hinder US research leadership and may face legal challenges.

Trump executive order gives political control over federal science funding. (AI Image) Trump hands political appointees control over science funding: Here's why researchers are sounding the alarmPresident Trump has signed an executive order that grants political appointees increased authority over the allocation of billions of dollars in federal grants across various US government agencies. The order requires agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and FEMA to designate officials responsible for reviewing grant opportunities to ensure they align with agency priorities and the “national interest.”The new directives also allow agencies to terminate existing and future grants at any point during the grant period. This significant shift in the grant process has raised concerns among scientists who warn it could undermine the impartial funding system that has long supported US leadership in research and development.Changes in federal grant oversight and implications for researchUnder the order, no new federal funding opportunities can be announced until the agencies implement the new review protocols. The Trump administration states these measures are intended to “strengthen oversight” and “streamline agency grantmaking.” However, researchers argue the changes introduce political interference into what was previously a merit-based funding process.Joseph Bak-Coleman, a scientist specialising in group decision-making at the University of Washington, said this is “taking political control of a once politically neutral mechanism for funding science in the US,” as quoted by the Associated Press. The move has raised fears that decisions about scientific grants may no longer be based solely on expertise and research merit.Impact on scientific progress and emergency fundingThe changes have already resulted in the termination of thousands of research grants, including projects on transgender health, vaccine hesitancy, misinformation, and diversity, equity, and inclusion, according to the Associated Press. The Association of American Medical Colleges warned that the order will “delay grant review and approval,” slowing progress in critical areas such as cures and treatments urgently needed by patients and families nationwide.Beyond scientific research, the executive order could affect emergency relief grants managed by FEMA, public safety funding through the Department of Justice, and public health programmes supported by the Centres for Disease Control (CDC). Experts suggest that the increased political control over grant distribution may influence the effectiveness of these essential services.Potential legal challenges and future consequencesThe executive order is expected to face legal challenges, as its sweeping changes raise questions about the proper role of political influence in federal grantmaking. The uncertainty caused by the new rules may disrupt ongoing projects and deter future research initiatives, experts say.In summary, the Trump administration's executive order introduces new layers of political oversight into the federal grant system, shifting power to political appointees and raising concerns among the scientific community about the future of unbiased, merit-based funding in the US.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

Viewers are engaging in temple-like rituals, chanting mantras, removing shoes, and offering prayers during screenings. These movies tap into deep-rooted faith and cultural traditions, fostering a profound connection beyond mere entertainment, blurring the lines between cinema and worship.  When theaters turn sacred: How films like ‘Mahavatar Narsimha,’ ‘Kantara,’ ‘HanuMan,’ and ‘Adipurush’ transform cinema into a spiritual experienceCinema has always been a reflection of human emotion—it can make us laugh, cry, think, and even challenge our beliefs. But every once in a while, a film does something more. It transcends entertainment, evoking a spiritual connection so profound that theaters themselves feel transformed into temples.'Mahavatar Narsimha' Rockets to ₹37 Crore in Six Days—Animated Epic Becomes Surprise HitThe latest example is Mahavatar Narsimha, a mythological spectacle that is not only ruling the box office but also capturing the hearts and minds of audiences across India.A tradition rooted in the pastThis phenomenon isn’t new. In the 1970s, devotional films like Jai Santoshi Maa witnessed unprecedented audience devotion. People brought flowers, lit incense sticks, performed aartis inside cinema halls, and even distributed prasad. For many, the screenings were as sacred as temple visits.The same tradition has found a modern revival. With Mahavatar Narsimha and other films in this genre, audiences are once again blurring the lines between watching a film and participating in a religious ritual.The divine pull of ‘Mahavatar Narsimha’The film narrates the timeless tale of devotee Prahlad and his unwavering faith in Lord Vishnu. Prahlad’s father, the tyrant king Hiranyakashipu, deems Vishnu his enemy and makes repeated attempts to kill his own son. But as the legend goes, the Lord himself descends in the form of Narsimha—half man, half lion—to protect his devotee and destroy evil.Audiences have been left awestruck, not just by the film’s visual grandeur and animation but by the divine aura it creates. In many theaters, people are removing their shoes before entering, as if stepping into a temple. Others are chanting mantras and slokas during the climax, their voices echoing in the dark halls.The film’s makers recently shared a heartfelt note on social media, saying:“We are humbled and overwhelmed by the divine response to Mahavatar Narsimha. What began as a cinematic dream has now become a spiritual movement across the country. Theaters have turned into sacred spaces, with devotees performing kirtans, singing aartis, and experiencing a deep connection with Narsimha Dev. This film was never just a movie; it was a vision to rekindle faith and celebrate our rich spiritual heritage. Seeing people from all walks of life come together in devotion is the greatest reward we could have imagined.”They further added, “Your love proves that Bharat is ready and eager for stories rooted in our shastras and dharma. This is just the beginning—with your blessings, we will continue to bring such powerful stories to life.”The ‘Kantara’ phenomenonJust a couple of years ago, Rishab Shetty’s Kantara created a similar impact. Rooted in the folklore and traditions of coastal Karnataka, the film culminated in a spiritually charged climax that left audiences spellbound. There were even reports of people experiencing trance-like states and feeling “possessed” during the final sequences, a testament to the film’s deep cultural resonance.The film blurred the line between cinema and ritual, proving that when storytelling taps into collective memory and faith, the experience can go far beyond the screen.The power of ‘HanuMan’Prashanth Varma’s HanuMan took this divine connection to a new level, blending superhero spectacle with spiritual symbolism. Theaters reverberated with chants of “Jai Shri Ram” and “Jai Hanuman” as the film unfolded, with many viewers describing an “unmatchable energy” they felt while watching.In some places, the screening turned into a collective act of worship, with audience members offering prayers and sharing prasad, just as they would in a temple.Interesting the movie shows how faith is of utmost importance.In an interview with NDTV, Ashwin Kumar clarified that Mahavatar Narsimha is not aimed solely at Hindus, but is meant for people of all faiths. “I’ve had people from various communities, including many Muslim viewers, tell me that the film strengthened their own faith. I’m not asking anyone to convert their religion. What I’m saying is—understand what faith is. Whether you pray to a God, believe in energy, or place your trust in the universe, this film simply asks you to surrender to that faith,” he explained. Mahavatar Narsimha tells the story of the evil king Hirankashyap, blessed with special layered immunity by Lord Brahma. When he mistreats his son Prahlada, a devoted follower of Lord Vishnu, the deity takes the form of Lord Narsimha to protect the child.However, Kumar insists the film is not “religious” in the conventional sense. “This is not a religious film—it’s an interfaith film about belief. Love is a universal emotion, and so is faith. That’s why the film is growing in leaps and bounds,” he said.When the divine shows up in real lifeIn the case of Adipurush, the mythology seemed to spill into the real world when a monkey—considered sacred in Hindu tradition—unexpectedly appeared during filming. For many, it felt like a sign of divine blessing, adding to the film’s spiritual aura even before its release.Shiva Rajkumar Reactions After Watching HanuMan Movie | Teja Sajja | prasanth varmaWhen cinema becomes faithThese films show that cinema has the power to be more than just entertainment. It can be a spiritual awakening, a communal act of devotion, and a reminder of the cultural and religious threads that bind people together.In such moments, the theater ceases to be just a building with a screen—it becomes a sanctum, a place where stories are not only watched but also worshipped.And perhaps that is the true magic of cinema: its ability to move people so deeply that they forget they are watching fiction and instead feel they are in the presence of the divine.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Ashish Chanchalani recently recounted the aftermath of the 'India's Got Latent' controversy, revealing he was the first panelist approached by police. He explained Samay Raina was in Vancouver, Apoorva Mukhija was unreachable, and Ranveer Allahbadia had disappeared. Ashish expressed frustration at the seriousness of the situation, clarifying that even his laughter was scrutinized and had to be explained to authorities. Ashish Chanchalani recently opened up about the chaos that followed the India’s Got Latent controversy, revealing how the police came knocking on his door first—while fellow panelists Samay Raina and Apoorva Mukhija remained out of reach. Chaotic two months after the controversySpeaking to Faridoon Shahryar about that difficult time, Ashish said that those two months were chaotic for everyone involved in the show. He explained that Samay was in Vancouver, Apoorva couldn’t be found and was scared, and Ranveer Allahbadia had disappeared. Since Ashish was the only one in Bandra and the police knew where he lived, they came to him first, and he had to give his statement to the police.Frustration over serious situationHe further shared his frustration about how serious the situation was. He said that while many saw it as just clickbait or a reel, facing the police and government officials was very serious. When asked why he was questioned even though he didn’t say anything controversial, he explained that people might think he wasn’t involved, but sitting in front of the police and knowing everything you say is recorded makes you realize how careful you must be. He added that he didn’t say much on the show—only laughed once—but even that was noted.Ashish also revealed that the authorities carefully examined every reaction, including his laughter, which he had to explain in detail. He said he had to tell them that he was laughing because of some inside jokes with Samay and at Ranveer’s foolishness—not at the inappropriate comment Ranveer made.Ashish defends Ranveer AllahbadiaSpeaking about Ranveer’s controversial remark, Ashish said he has known Ranveer for seven years and that Ranveer often speaks jokingly. He added that while the situation was tough for him, it was even harder for Samay, Apoorva, and the others involved.After the controversy, all episodes of India’s Got Latent were taken down from YouTube. The Supreme Court initially banned Allahbadia from posting on social media but later lifted the ban.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Mahavatar Narsimha, the animated mythological film, has achieved remarkable success, crossing USD 1 million in North America. Its popularity among the diaspora is evident, highlighting the appeal of Indian stories. Domestically, the film has earned Rs 168 crore, with the Hindi version surpassing Rs 100 crore, a first for an Indian animated film. Ashwin Kumar's Mahavatar Narsimha is proving to be nothing short of a box office juggernaut. The mythological animated spectacle has now crossed the coveted USD 1 million milestone in North America, cementing its place as one of the most successful Indian films overseas this year.The film had been on a steady upward trend since release, but the weekend proved to be a turning point in its overseas performance. Till Friday the film had earned about USD 585,000 and Saturday numbers were tracking between USD 250,000–300,000 collection and even on Sunday the numbers were close to USD 250,000. And with that the film has finally crossed the USD 1 million mark, an achievement that underlines its growing popularity among the diaspora.The North America market is a very mature market when it comes to animation films thanks to Hollywood films, but for a film that is rooted in Indian history goes on to show people are willing to step out if the film has a good message. Mahavatar Narsimha tells the story of Hiranyakashyap and his son Prahlad and the eternal battle of good vs evil.'Mahavatar Narsimha' Rockets to ₹37 Crore in Six Days—Animated Epic Becomes Surprise HitWhile Mahavatar Narsimha’s North American rampage is making headlines, its performance back home in India is equally — if not more — impressive. The film has already raked in Rs 168 crore domestically of which it’s Hindi version has collected over Rs 126 crore, making it the sixth biggest Hindi hit of 2025 so far. In doing so, it has achieved a historic milestone — becoming the first-ever Hindi animated film to cross the Rs 100 crore mark at the Indian box office.The film is expected to have a slow run with the onset of the weekend as majority of screens would be given to Rajinikanth’s Coolie and Hrithik Roshan, Jr.NTR and Kiara Advani’s War 2 as both films are clashing on 14th August. Between the two films the box office has earned more than USD 2.2 million dollars and is expected to be the biggest weekend for Indian films in the circuit.

Shah Rukh Khan delivered a memorable performance in 'Chak De! India,' but the role was initially offered to Salman Khan. Salman declined due to his then-prevailing image of doing commercial movies, fearing his fans would expect a typical heroic portrayal, which didn't align with the film's serious tone and the character of a hockey coach.

India,' but the role was initially offered to Salman Khan. Salman declined due to his then-prevailing image of doing commercial movies, fearing his fans would expect a typical heroic portrayal, which didn't align with the film's serious tone and the character of a hockey coach.  Shah Rukh Khan, who is known for his unmatched charisma, has given multiple hits over the decades. His versatility has translated into several cinematic gems, an example of the same is ‘Chak De! India.’ However, did you know that Shah Rukh Khan was not the first choice for ‘Chak De! India,’ but another Khan of Bollywood? This 2007 sports drama was initially offered to the ‘Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan’ actor Salman Khan.Why did Salman Khan reject ‘Chak De! India’?Salman Khan, who is known for his sense of humour, during the promotions of ‘Sultan’ in 2016, joked, “I left it because even Shah Rukh Khan should be a part of a few great films.”Shah Rukh Khan Injured on Set of KING | One-Month Break, US Treatment, Shoot HaltedHe later added that back then, his fans had heroic expectations, and the image of Kabir Khan, the sports coach, didn’t fit the bill. “When I was offered Chak De, my image was totally different as I was doing Partner and all those kinds of films. My only thing in Chak De was that my fans would expect me to wear a wig and win the match for India, which would not go for the film. That was not my genre at that point in time,” said Salman.He continued, “It was a more serious kind of film, and I was doing more of a commercial kind of cinema, which I am still doing. I would never move out of the commercial cinema zone, but it is just that there would be a lot of meaningful cinema in the commercial zone.”‘Chak De! India’Released in 2007, ‘Chak De! India’ told the gritty, emotional journey of a women’s hockey team, their struggles, their wins, and the unbreakable bond that made them champions. The story drew inspiration from the life of former hockey player Mir Ranjan Negi. Shah Rukh Khan took on the role of a coach looking to redeem his reputation, a choice he accepted quickly as he had played hockey in college.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Salman Khan's Tiger and Shah Rukh Khan's Pathaan will not appear. Bobby Deol will enter the YRF Spy Universe as a key villain. The film will set up the next chapter, Alpha. Directed by Ayan Mukerji, War 2 releases on August 14, 2025.  The much-awaited ‘War 2’ is already creating buzz for bringing Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR together on screen for the first time. Putting an end to the rumour mills with a surprise twist, reports suggest that Salman Khan’s Tiger and Shah Rukh Khan’s Pathaan won’t be making appearances. Instead, Bobby Deol will make a game-changing entry.No Tiger or Pathaan cameo this timeFor months, there had been talk that ‘War 2’ would feature explosive end-credit cameos from the YRF Spy Universe’s biggest names, Salman Khan’s Tiger or Shah Rukh Khan’s Pathaan. However, sources now reveal that neither of the fan-favourite agents will show up.Hrithik and Jr NTR ignite the dance floor in 'War 2' teaser!According to a Bollywood Hungama report, “War 2 won’t feature either of Tiger or Pathaan's character portrayed by Salman Khan and Shah Rukjh Khan respectively, however, their names will be used at some key junctures of the film. The end credit sequence of War 2 will act as a build up for the next chapter of YRF Spy Universe – Alpha. Aditya Chopra is staying true to his vision of continuing the story forward, rather than opting for gimmicks by bringing all 3 superstars in the same film. He is reserving the union of all 3 superstars for a mega project, which is in the development stage.”Setting up the next big chapterThe absence of Tiger and Pathaan isn’t just a missing star moment, it’s part of a bigger plan. The end credits will lead directly into the next spy thriller, ‘Alpha’, instead of being a flashy cameo scene. This means fans can expect the storyline to keep flowing naturally, rather than being interrupted by quick appearances.Bobby Deol enters with a bangRather than banking on Salman or Shah Rukh’s brief appearances, the makers have decided to use ‘War 2’ to introduce a new and important character. And it’s none other than Bobby Deol.The report further states, “With War 2, Aditya Chopra will be establishing Bobby Deol to the Universe. It’s an epic introduction to Bobby Deol’s character, who is one of the main villains in the timeline going forward. Aditya Chopra is known to go against the tide, and instead of establishing his two female leads of Alpha, Alia Bhatt and Sharvari – he is going ahead by unleashing the negative force of the film, Bobby Deol.”About ‘War 2’ and its big starsDirected by Ayan Mukerji, ‘War 2’ is the sixth film in the YRF Spy Universe. It is set to release in Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu on 14 August 2025. The movie stars Hrithik Roshan, Jr NTR, and Kiara Advani in key roles.The story sees a powerful face-off between Hrithik Roshan’s Major Kabir Dhaliwal and Jr NTR’s Vikram. Both are Indian spies, but their beliefs about patriotism clash sharply, turning their rivalry into a battle of ideals as well as action. Kiara Advani plays Kavya Luthra, a central figure who plays an important role in how events unfold.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Beyond his 30-year acting career spanning 150 films, Shetty's ventures include hospitality with restaurants like H2O and Little Italy.  Suniel Shetty has had an enduring Bollywood career spanning over thirty years and is also popularly known as Anna. Keeping his brand as one of the leading action stars of the 1990s and 2000s, he has transformed from a film star into a multi-faceted person. In addition to acting, he is an entrepreneur, philanthropist, and fitness aficionado, and he continues to tap into everything he pursues. His zeal and character for performing, as well as his disciplined body, have all gained him a fan base that spans generations.Suniel Shetty and his strong careerSuniel is still going strong, from delivering impactful dialogues to making calculated career decisions. As recently as 2025, his estimated net worth was at about ₹125 crore (almost $15 million). His income stream is as varied as his career has been, including films, endorsements, hospitality, real estate, and fitness. As an actor for more than 30 years in over 150 films, he has earned an estimated ₹300 crore in acting alone, which will be enhanced by his other business interests.Suniel Shetty Gets Slammed for His Views | Daughter Athiya Drops a Brutal Reality CheckA pioneer in the hospitality business in Bollywood, Suniel launched H2O (a popular restaurant and bar in Bandra, Mumbai), which grew extremely popular in a very short span of time after it was opened, due in part to the number of celebrities that frequented his restaurant. After its successful run, Suniel scaled down H2O and turned it into the restaurant Little Italy, which offered good, authentic Italian food for both high-end clients and the general public.PollDo you think Suniel Shetty's transition from actor to entrepreneur is inspiring?Yes, absolutely!No, not really.In terms of acting, Suniel most recently appeared in the show 'Hunter 2' on Amazon MX Player, playing the character of ACP Vikram Sinha, a man trying to find and rescue his kidnapped daughter from a psychopath known as The Salesman, played by Jackie Shroff. Throughout the series there is insight into Vikram's past, and a balance of high-octane action and emotional reference is present.Looking ahead, Suniel is part of Welcome to the Jungle, the third film in the Welcome franchise, alongside Akshay Kumar, Paresh Rawal, and an ensemble cast. He will also reprise his beloved role in 'Hera Pheri 3', with filming now back on track after delays.Some of Suniel Shetty’s most iconic dialogues:“Main tumhe bhool jaon yeh ho nahi sakta … aur tum mujhe bhool jao, yeh main hone nahi doonga.” (Dhadkan)“Dilwale toh bahut dekhe, lekin pyar mein joh pagal ho jaye … aise dilwale ko aaj pehli baar dekha.” (Dilwale)“Mohabbat aur paagalpan ka bohot purana rishta hai.” (Border)“Ek sachche desh bhakt ko hum fauj se nikaal sakte hain, lekin uske dil se desh bhakti nahi.” (Jai Ho)“Tumhare haathon mein woh rekhayein hai, jo mere haathon mein nahi hai … Tumhare maathe pe woh lakeerein hai, jo mere maathe par nahi hai.” (Dhadkan)We see Suniel Shetty moving from the cinema to the corporate world, signifying the fact that true stars rise to the occasion when faced with challenges and turn out to be more adaptable than you think.

When director Ravi revealed on-set tension between Raaj and Dilip
The 1991 film 'Saudagar' brought Dilip Kumar and Raaj Kumar together, though a known tension existed between them. Action director Ravi Dewan recalls Raaj Kumar's subtle acts of indifference on set, like avoiding fan interactions and causing retakes. Their cold war reportedly began during 'Paigham' in 1959. Despite their strained relationship, 'Saudagar' became a commercial success.

Action director Ravi Dewan recalls Raaj Kumar's subtle acts of indifference on set, like avoiding fan interactions and causing retakes. Their cold war reportedly began during 'Paigham' in 1959. Despite their strained relationship, 'Saudagar' became a commercial success. 12 When 'Saudagar' hit theatres in 1991, audiences were mesmerised by the rare pairing of two cinematic giants Dilip Kumar and Raaj Kumar. On-screen, their chemistry was magnetic, but behind the scenes, things were far from cordial.Speaking on Sutradhar with Vineet Rai, according to veteran action director Ravi Dewan, the tension between the two often surfaced in subtle yet telling ways during filming. Dewan recalled an intense death scene where all eyes were fixed on Dilip Kumar, except for Raaj Kumar’s. With no shot scheduled for him that day, Raaj quietly placed his chair eight feet away, facing the opposite direction. This was seemingly indifferent to the moment.Saira Banu Shares Rare Photos of Dilip Kumar & Lata MangeshkarThe waterfall incident that spoke volumesOne particularly memorable episode took place during a shoot at a hill station. While couples and fans flocked to click photos with Dilip Kumar, Raaj Kumar wandered off to a nearby waterfall. There, he pulled up a chair and sat knee-deep in the icy water. When director Subhash Ghai eventually asked why, Raaj quipped, “Yahan photo kheenchne koi nahi aayega” (“No one will come here to take photos”). For Dewan, this was Raaj in his element — unpredictable, calculated, and often aloof from the crowd’s attention.PollWhich actor do you think had the more compelling screen presence in 'Saudagar'?Dilip KumarRaaj KumarClashes, retakes, and an old grudgeRaaj Kumar’s quirks extended beyond avoiding fan interactions. Dewan revealed that in one rope-pulling scene with Amrish Puri, Raaj insisted on multiple retakes despite the first take going perfectly. In a punch scene, he delivered such force that it caused Puri genuine discomfort. Dilip and Raaj's cold war reportedly began during 'Paigham' (1959), when Raaj allegedly struck Dilip too hard in a scene, prompting the latter to vow never to work with his contemporaries again. Fate, however, had other plans, reuniting them for 'Saudagar'.Despite their personal distance, 'Saudagar' emerged as a commercial success.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Strong word-of-mouth and positive reviews contribute to its success. The movie's total collection across languages reaches Rs 168.75 crore. It faces a major clash with Coolie and War 2 soon. Ashwin Kumar's Mahavatar Narasimha has pulled off yet another box office milestone. With its total Hindi collections now standing at Rs 126.15 crore, the animation mythological drama has officially climbed to the sixth spot among the highest-grossing Hindi films of 2025. In doing so, it has overtaken Akshay Kumar’s Sky Force (Rs 113.62 crore) and Salman Khan’s Sikandar (Rs 110.36 crore).The film’s box office trajectory has been nothing short of remarkable in the Hindi belt. Opening modestly at Rs 1.35 crore on Day 1, the film picked up steam over the first weekend with Rs 3.25 crore on Day 2 and Rs 6.8 crore on Day 3. The strong word-of-mouth, coupled with glowing reviews for its performances and action sequences, helped it hold steady through the weekdays and ended week 1 with Rs 32.45 crore in Hindi. The momentum didn’t slow in the second week as well where it added another Rs 54.95 crore to its kitty. What really sealed its place among the year’s top earners was its third weekend. Day 16 brought in Rs 16 crore, Day 17 stood at Rs 17.5 crore as per early trends, thus taking the overall collection of the film to Rs 126.15 for its Hindi version,meaning the third Sunday’s haul was strong enough to propel the film past both Sky Force and Sikandar. The film has been released in multiple languages and its overall collection across languages stands at Rs 168.75 crore. With this latest milestone, Mahavatar Narasimha now sits behind only five other Hindi releases of the year like Chhava, Saiyaara, Sitaara Zameen Par , Housefull 5 and Raid 2. The film still has three more days before the biggest clash of Indian Cinema takes place on 14th August as Rajinikanth and Lokesh Kanagaraj’s Coolie clashes with Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR’s War 2. It would be a case study as to how this now animation giant holds out against these big names and how much box office collection it can make.

Mohit Suri's musical romance 'Saiyaara,' starring debutants Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda, is on the verge of surpassing Salman Khan's 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' at the box office. With India net collections at Rs 318 crore after 24 days, it needs just Rs 2.34 crore more to claim the 14th spot among highest-grossing Hindi films. Mohit Suri’s romantic musical Saiyaara, led by debutant Ahaan Panday and newcomer Aneet Padda, is just a whisker away from a major box office milestone. After 24 days in cinemas, the film’s India net collections stand at an impressive Rs 318 crore, meaning it needs only Rs 2.34 crore more to surpass Salman Khan’s Bajrangi Bhaijaan (Rs 320.34 crore) and claim the 14th spot among the highest-grossing Hindi films of all time.The journey of Saiyaara at the box office has been nothing short of phenomenal, especially considering it was a love story headlined by two fresh faces. The film opened strongly with Rs 21.5 crore on its first Friday, powered by positive reviews and strong buzz about Mohit Suri’s return to his romantic storytelling roots. Collections surged over the weekend, with Rs 26 crore on Saturday and a stellar Rs 35.75 crore on Sunday, giving it one of the highest first-weekend totals for a non-action Hindi film in recent years.EXCLUSIVE: Mohit Suri Spills On 20 Years In Bollywood - Ahaan & Aneet, Alia Bhatt Dream Collab & MoreThe momentum continued through the week, with Monday bringing in Rs 24 crore, followed by Rs 25 crore on Tuesday—a rare instance of a weekday surpassing Monday numbers. Wednesday and Thursday saw slight dips to Rs 21.5 crore and Rs 19 crore respectively, but the film closed Week 1 with Rs 172.75 crore, a remarkable start by any standard.In Week 2, Saiyaara maintained steady collections. While Friday saw a marginal drop to Rs 18 crore, the weekend again brought in big numbers—Rs 26.5 crore on Saturday and Rs 30 crore on Sunday. However, the Monday crash to Rs 9.25 crore marked the start of its gradual slowdown, with Tuesday at Rs 10 crore, Wednesday at Rs 7.5 crore, and Thursday at Rs 6.5 crore, ending the week at Rs 107.75 crore. Even so, this brought the 14-day total to a staggering Rs 280.5 crore.Week 3 was slower, beginning with Rs 4.5 crore on Friday and peaking at Rs 8 crore on Sunday. The weekdays stayed low, averaging around Rs 2–Rs 2.5 crore per day, for a weekly haul of Rs 28.25 crore.Now in its fourth week, Saiyaara is holding better than expected. Friday and Saturday brought Rs 2 crore and Rs 3.5 crore respectively, and Sunday’s early estimate stands at Rs 3.75 crore. With strong weekend multipliers and continued audience interest in urban centers and multiplex chains, industry experts believe the film will cross the Rs 320 crore mark comfortably within the next few days.The film’s success has cemented Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda as promising new talents and reaffirmed Mohit Suri’s ability to deliver commercially and emotionally resonant cinema.If Saiyaara overtakes Bajrangi Bhaijaan, it will be a landmark achievement displacing a beloved Salman Khan blockbuster from it’s 14th spot to 15th spot. With just Rs 2.34 crore to go, that historic moment is now inevitable.The film is expected to attain 14th spot before the clash between Rajinikanth's Coolie and Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR's War 2 takes place on 14th August.

He acknowledges that deviating from this persona led to missteps and a period of poor script choices, impacting his stardom.  Suniel Shetty, one of Bollywood’s most beloved action stars, has never shied away from experimenting across genres, be it romance in ‘Dhadkan,’ patriotism in ‘Border,’ or comedy in 'Hera Pheri'. Yet, in a candid old interview from 2023, given during the promotions of ‘Dharavi Bank,’ Suniel admitted that it was his action-hero image that truly gave him longevity in the industry.

He explained that this persona also provided him with the chance to explore other genres, like comedy. While acknowledging that he didn't have a string of blockbuster hits, he noted that his continuous experimentation across different genres was what ultimately kept him relevant to audiences throughout his career.“The last 30 years in the industry was purely because of my action image. That gave me an opportunity to do comedy,” shared Shetty.PollWhat genre do you think Suniel Shetty excels in the most?ActionComedySuniel Shetty on downfallHowever, Suniel confessed that straying too far from his established image didn’t always work in his favor. “I failed at times when I tried to do things differently because the audience wanted to see you with a particular image,” he said. The real turning point came when he began making what he now calls “wrong choices” in scripts. Those missteps, he admitted, cost him dearly, not only did he lose stardom, but also the box-office hold he once enjoyed. “When that happens to you, trash started coming. That’s when I decided that it’s better to not do anything than do trash,” Suniel reflected.Suniel Shetty on hiatus, reflection, and the road aheadThe ‘Hunter’ actor revealed that a combination of “personal reasons and trash” projects kept him away from films for nearly seven to eight years. The pandemic, he has said in other conversations, further reinforced his belief in doing meaningful work rather than repetitive roles. Now, he’s back with a renewed focus on quality over quantity. Recently seen in the action thriller 'Hunter 2', Suniel’s next big outing is 'Hera Pheri 3', reuniting him with Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal for one of Bollywood’s most loved comedy franchises.Genelia's birthday: Riteish Deshmukh's touching post melts hearts, B-town showers loveAbout the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Rajinikanth's 'Coolie,' directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj, is poised to break records in North America, nearing $1.86 million in premiere sales, challenging 'Kabali's' record. The film, featuring a pan-Indian cast including Nagarjuna and Aamir Khan, faces 'War 2' at the box office but boasts strong advance sales. 'Coolie' is anticipated to be a major cultural event for Tamil cinema. The Rajinikanth0Lokesh Kanagaraj juggernaut Coolie is on the verge of creating history in North America. With three days still to go before its August 14 premiere, the film has already raked in a staggering USD 1.60 million for it’s premiere shows in USA alone and after adding Canada numbers the collection jumps to USD 1.86 million. This put Coolie well within touching distance of the all-time Tamil record set by Kabali in 2016 with $1.92 million.Trade analysts say the pace of ticket sales points to Coolie not just breaking Kabali’s record but doing so with room to spare, potentially setting a new benchmark for Tamil cinema in the region. The massive surge in bookings over the past week signals the power of the Rajinikanth and Lokesh Kanagaraj pairing, which has sent fan anticipation through the roof. The director, known for his high-octane, stylized action narratives, appears to have delivered yet another mass entertainer that has struck a chord well before release.The star-studded ensemble has only amplified the hype. Joining Rajinikanth are Telugu superstar Nagarjuna, Malayalam favorite Shoubin Shahir, Kannada legend Upendra, veteran actor Sathyaraj, and Shruti Haasan, with Bollywood icon Aamir Khan making a special cameo appearance. The sheer range of pan-Indian talent has helped Coolie transcend regional boundaries, fueling advance sales across diverse South Asian diaspora pockets in North America.Adding to the excitement is the fact that Coolie is headed for one of the year’s biggest box office clashes. The film will release alongside War 2, led by Hrithik Roshan, Jr NTR, and Kiara Advani, and directed by Ayan Mukerji. While War 2 has made a solid start in the USA with USD 435K in North America , Coolie currently holds a commanding lead.The stark gap between the two films’ advance sales reflects not just Coolie’s overwhelming star power but also the fierce loyalty of Rajinikanth’s overseas fanbase. His last outings in Jailer had l performed exceptionally in the circuit , but the current momentum suggests Coolie could be his biggest opener in the market yet.With just days to go, Coolie is more than a film release—it’s shaping up to be a cultural event for Tamil cinema overseas. Whether it’s the record-breaking premiere, the mega cast, or the Lokesh Kanagaraj brand of spectacle, all signs point to August 14 delivering fireworks at the North American box office.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

A recent report indicates a large portion of Indian media consumers access pirated content, costing the industry billions. Industry stakeholders emphasize the need for collaborative efforts, including stricter regulations and audience awareness, to combat piracy and protect the creative ecosystem, ensuring its continued growth and sustainability.  Piracy has been a silent threat looming over the entertainment industry for decades now. The sad part is that even in the era where digital content flows effortlessly and there are several measures to tackle piracy, this plague isn’t slowing down. Its menace extends far beyond the loss of reverence, disrupting the broader ecosystem of the entertainment industry and leaving a big question mark on where we stand on cybersecurity.What is piracy?Piracy is the unlawful duplication, distribution, or utilization of copyrighted content, which encompasses music, films, software, and various types of intellectual property. It is regarded as a type of theft since it violates the rights of the original creators and can result in considerable financial harm to them.Raghav Chadha Takes A Vote On His Moustache | Parineeti’s Reply Steals The ShowThe rise of piracy in the digital ageIn 2023, a report by EY and the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) indicated that 51 percent of media consumers in India obtain content through pirated sources, with streaming services accounting for the largest share at 63 percent."The size of India's piracy economy was Rs 22,400 crore in 2023, ranking fourth against the segment-wise revenue generated by India's Media and Entertainment industry. Of this, Rs 13,700 crore was generated from pirated content from movie theatres, while Rs 8,700 crore was generated from OTT platforms' content. The potential GST losses of up to Rs 4,300 crore were estimated to have been incurred," quoted the report..Rohit Jain, Chairman of IAMAI's Digital Entertainment Committee, added, “The rapid growth of digital entertainment in India is undeniable, with filmed entertainment expected to reach Rs 14,600 crore by 2026. However, this potential is severely threatened by rampant piracy. It is imperative for all stakeholders -- government bodies, industry players, and consumers--to unite in combating this issue."Later in 2024, Raghav Chadha, an active member of AAP and actor Parineeti Chopra’s husband, raised his voice on the matter of piracy in Rajya Sabha. He shared the clip on his social media handle with the caption - “Piracy is a significant plague that is all pervasive in the film industry and now in OTT world as well.” Sharing some statistics, he added, “The film industry is facing a loss of Rs 20,000 crore annually because of piracy. Online piracy saw a 62% surge during the pandemic.”“We passed the Cinematographic (Amendment) Bill, a year back but it lacks a concrete mechanism against online piracy and focuses largely on anti-cam recording in multiplexes. As we go digital with more movies being streamed on platforms, I ask the Government what is being done to curb the issue of digital piracy on OTT and whether the government has any plans to bring a dedicated legislation for the same?” he concluded.Industry weighs inETimes got in touch with some actors and filmmakers and asked them to speak on the impact of piracy on the industry. They offered a closer look at the domino effect it caused. “It's like if one production spends, there are 200-300 people that are connected with it, and everyone earns from it. It’s not that they don’t get money if there is piracy, but it becomes difficult for the production houses to bear something like this next time,” said Munawar Faruqui in his exclusive conversation with us.He added that both the audience and the production houses will have to put some extra effort into reducing piracy and its ill effects, “So it is like everyone is at a loss if there is piracy, and you said it correctly that piracy is the sad reality, and that is why we want to make good content that travels, even if it's good or bad, piracy should not be done, and the audience should take the responsibility for this.” “If they want to see entertainment, then they have to make some effort. At the same time, I think production houses make sure that they are making more efforts,” he concluded. Echoing the same sentiment, director Farhan P. Zamma shared, “Shooting for the promotion only requires almost 10 people. Just imagine they all want to see for free, if you say to remove the ads too, and we will see the pirated version. So how are people going to get paid, and how are they gonna get salaries? Or there will be no motivation to make anything further because until there is revenue, they will not earn anything. So nobody will invest in that business. This is very harsh because no one will get jobs.”On the other hand, actress Krystle D'souza shared her point of view on the subject, shared how it not only impacts the business but also the image of a movie. “I honestly feel, there used to be a time when box office collection meant if your film was a hit or miss, and if you didn’t get the collection, then your film would be titled as a flop film,” said the actress. She continued, “That is sad because you know sometimes some good films didn't make it as hits only because of piracy, only because people didn't go to theaters to watch it, but they all wanted to watch it at home and that's just sad for the entire crew, the entire team that put in so much of effort and energy to make a film.” A fight against piracy - One step at a timeThe bigger the movie, the more chances of piracy. Be it one of South’s biggest blockbusters, like ‘Pushpa 2’, or a controversial political biopic like ‘Emergency,’ in recent times, it has been observed that either the movie gets leaked online before the release, or a pirated version of it reaches the web. Considering all this, Aamir Khan, who gave his 2025’s highly anticipated film ‘Sitaare Zameen Par’, employed all the right efforts to fight piracy. "We have appointed anti-piracy teams who remove pirated links from the internet. The pay-per-view model I'm introducing, where people can watch a film for Rs 100, may help reduce piracy. It also gives some hope to creative people. It will not bring any change to the theatre chain because the experience is completely different," he told IANS.ConclusionThe war against piracy extends beyond legal measures. It is more about awareness, accountability, and appreciation for creative works. Industry voices emphasize that each pirated download or stream undermines not only box office sales but also the livelihoods and morale of those involved in storytelling.In the current scenario, there is a dire need for stricter regulations, anti-piracy initiatives, and innovative viewing options, along with the audience's support. While the journey may be difficult, a collaborative effort from creators, lawmakers, and consumers can help mitigate the impact of piracy, allowing art to flourish, stories to motivate, and the industry to expand.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousCarrie Coon’s secret weapon on TV?

These changes include mandatory public social media profiles for visa applicants, stricter vetting processes, and potential alterations to authorized stay calculations. Applicants should maintain clean online records, apply early, and stay updated through official government websites to navigate these evolving regulations.  U.S.is home to some reputed universities in the world and has been attracting global students for a long time now. However, in 2025 there have been some major policy shifts that have impacted the education industry as a whole. The U.S. policy makers have made a lot of changes. From making social media accounts public and pausing and resuming visa interviews to offering fixed-term eligibility under proposal, and increasing visa fees, the changes are endless and confusing too.So let’s try to understand the new changes:Make Social Media Public Amid several ongoing changes, the U.S. asked students wanting to study in American universities to make their social media profiles public because public persona matters. The new change was implemented from June 18, 2025. So now, applicants for F (academic), M (vocational), and J (exchange) visas should submit their social media accounts and set their accounts on public mode. The officers will check and scrutinise posts and other shared content of the applicants. This year, the federal government updated visa vetting and processing policies. Let’s have a look at why it matters and how is it going to impact students:The new changesThe Department of State in 2025 announced the plans of expanding visa screening. It very clearly mentioned the applicants’ online presence matter to the ‘getting whole visa’ process calling it a part of consular vetting. The Department called it an “expanded screening and vetting” process. The Department of State also updated its interview-waiver guidance. It changed to which applicants may be eligible for an in-person interview waiver. The Department also narrowed categories eligible for waiver in several cases. It means that more visa applicants should expect to attend an in-person interview unless they meet the specific waiver criteria. How will these changes impact students?Increased documentation and strict review: The new changes mean more documentations and a strict review process. The reviewers can request more personal information. They can also look beyond transcripts and bank statements and survey the applicant’s public online history and activity. More in-person questions during the interview: With the new interview-waiver rules, applicants should expect to attend consular interviews. Expect delays. Expect changes to authorized stay: If U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) finalises a fixed-term admission rule, the way students’ authorized stay is calculated would also change in future. It will affect program planning, transfers, and some employment authorizations tied to enrollment length. This is a significant move as it can change the “duration of status” system—where F visas remain valid as long as students maintain course enrollment.What current applicants/students must keep in mindKeep checking official sites only: The potential applicants must keep themselves updated with current changes on the official websites of the State Department, DHS/ICE (SEVP), and USCIS. These pages are for authoritative updates rather than unofficial commentary. Official pages have guidance, timelines, and eligibility rules as well. Do not trust any other website. Keep your record clean: Now that it is mandatory to keep your social media profile open, it is necessary for applicants to keep their record clean and monitor their online presence. Also remember that officials will only believe public information and official records.Apply early and book interviews: It is important to maintain the timeline. Apply early and book interviews as there are higher chances of required in-person interviews. Schedule embassy or consulate appointments the moment you get your Form I-20 or DS-2019. Allow buffer time: Keep extra or buffer time for program completion and other administrative steps. Keep copies of all documents and paperwork. Now that U.S. agencies are more concerned about vetting and tightening the conditions, expect delays and keep extra time and other options ready. These changes are official and mentioned on DHS/SEVP, and USCIS guidance. Keep in touch with your universities who can offer better explanations and guidance.

If Virat Kohli was the poster boy for sporty-meets-slick dressing in the last decade, Gill is the Gen-Z evolution: a blend of quiet luxury, streetwear confidence, and just the right amount of boyish charm.From airport runs to ad campaigns, his wardrobe choices tell us one thing, Shubman knows the game when it comes to style just as much as he does cricket. Here are five fashion lessons to take straight from the captain’s playbook.by TOI Lifestyle Desk 2/7Master the imnimalist athleisureAthleisure might feel like old news, but Gill’s approach keeps it fresh. He gravitates towards clean joggers, crisp crew-neck tees, fitted track jackets, and statement sneakers but with a muted palette. No screaming neons, no over-the-top graphics - just carefully chosen, well-fitted pieces. Think Rahul Khanna’s subtle elegance meets KL Rahul’s sporty edge.The takeaway: Your gym wear can double as your casualwear if you keep it neutral, fitted, and polished.3/7Invest in statement jacketsWhether it’s a bomber in deep forest green, a varsity jacket with bold lettering, or a tailored overcoat for winter tours abroad, Shubman treats jackets like sartorial punctuation marks. They finish his outfit with personality, much like Ranbir Kapoor’s off-duty looks or even David Beckham’s classic layering game.The takeaway: A good jacket doesn’t just keep you warm, it can carry an entire look.4/7Keep denim simple but sharpGill avoids the trap of over-distressed or overly baggy jeans. His go-to? Mid- to dark-wash denims with a straight or slim fit, paired with either a tucked-in shirt for a slightly retro vibe or a hoodie for casual comfort. The fit is never sloppy, more Shahid Kapoor’s tailored casuals than anything grungy.The takeaway: A well-fitted pair of jeans can last you seasons, both in durability and relevance.5/7Embrace monochrome momentsFrom head-to-toe black at the airport to all-white for summer outings, Shubman understands the power of a single-colour statement. It’s sleek, elongating, and always photogenic. In fact, one could argue it’s his version of a “uniform,” much like how Anand Ahuja built his signature sneaker-with-suit look.The takeaway: Don’t fear monochrome, it’s not boring if you mix textures and tones.6/7​Accessorise with restraintWhile some sports stars pile on chains, caps, and oversized shades, Gill opts for a more balanced approach. A single luxury watch, a subtle cap, or a pair of aviators, never all at once. His accessories are functional yet aspirational, much like the way Hrithik Roshan styles his off-duty looks.The takeaway: Let accessories enhance, not overwhelm, your outfit.7/7​Bonus lesson - grooming mattersIt’s impossible to talk about Shubman Gill’s style without mentioning his grooming. The always-on-point fade, the occasional stubble, and skin that somehow always looks camera-ready, it’s the cricketing equivalent of a red-carpet prep. Like David Warner said about cricket, “Preparation is everything,” and in Gill’s case, that includes his hair and skin game.Shubman Gill is proof that you don’t have to be in Bollywood to have a blockbuster wardrobe. His style is approachable yet aspirational, a mix of pieces you can find on the high street and the occasional big-ticket splurge. He isn’t trying too hard, but he’s paying attention and in fashion, much like cricket, that’s how you win the match.Whether you are a cricket fan or just looking for some wardrobe cues, consider Gill your new style captain. And remember: sometimes the most stylish move is knowing when to play it safe and when to take a risk, on the field and in your closet.Follow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousSharvari Wagh brings charm to every pink detailindia10 animals that can survive intense radiationindia10 Indian states with maximum number of National ParkstravelHow to make natural hair colour using tea and coffeeindiaDivyanka Tripathi’s top 10 stylish must-have looksindia​How to make dhaba-style Egg Curry at home​Food9 heart-healthy foods that cut attack and stroke riskindiaSaniya Iyappan steals the spotlight with her graceindiaCarrie Coon’s secret weapon on TV?

Beyond its taste, arbi is packed with fiber, potassium, and antioxidants, promoting digestive and heart health while boosting immunity. Enjoy it boiled, roasted, or in curries for sustained energy and strong bones. Remember to cook it well to eliminate calcium oxalate crystals.  If you’ve ever come across the word arbi and wondered what it means, you’re not alone. Arbi, known in English as taro root, is a starchy, underground vegetable enjoyed across Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. Though it looks like a small, brown, fuzzy potato on the outside, it holds a creamy texture and nutty flavour inside that makes it incredibly versatile in the kitchen. Beyond taste, arbi offers numerous health benefits, making it a smart addition to your diet. Whether boiled, roasted, or added to curries, this humble root has far more to offer than meets the eye.What is arbi (Taro root)Arbi or taro root is a starchy tuber that grows underground and has been enjoyed by cultures worldwide for centuries. Its pale, creamy flesh and nutty flavour make it a versatile ingredient that can be boiled, fried, mashed, or added to stews. But what makes arbi special isn’t just the taste, it’s the range of health benefits packed inside this root.Why you should add arbi to your plate: Health benefits that matter1. Aids digestive health: One of the main benefits of arbi is its high fibre content, which helps maintain healthy digestion. Fibre adds bulk to stools, promoting regular bowel movements and preventing constipation. A well-functioning digestive system also supports better nutrient absorption and reduces the risk of digestive disorders.2. Supports heart health: Arbi is a good source of potassium, a mineral essential for maintaining healthy blood pressure levels. Potassium helps balance the effects of sodium and eases tension in blood vessel walls, reducing the risk of hypertension and heart disease. Eating potassium-rich foods like arbi can be an effective part of heart-friendly dietary habits.3. Boost your immunity: Thanks to antioxidants found in arbi, your body gets an extra shield against harmful free radicals. This support means your immune system can work more effectively to keep common illnesses at bay.4. Steady energy for your busy day: Unlike sugary snacks that give you a quick rush and then a crash, arbi provides slow-releasing energy. This means you’ll feel energised for longer, perfect for powering through work, study, or workouts.5. Strong bones and muscles: Arbi also contains minerals like magnesium and calcium that are essential for bone strength and muscle function. Eating arbi regularly may support your mobility and overall body strength as you age.6. Fighting inflammation naturally: Chronic inflammation is linked to many health problems, but nature offers help in arbi. Some compounds in taro root have anti-inflammatory properties, which might help reduce discomfort and protect your body long-term.How to enjoy arbiThe great thing about arbi is that it’s incredibly versatile. Here are some ways you can enjoy it:Boiled or steamed: Simply cook until tender and season with salt and herbs for a comforting side dish.Taro chips: Slice thinly and fry or bake for a crunchy snack that rivals regular potato chips.Curries and stews: Add chunks of arbi to your favourite curries or soups to soak up all the spices and flavours.Mashed arbi: Like mashed potatoes, but with a nuttier taste- try mixing with butter and garlic for a creamy delight.Soups: Add it to broths for a hearty texture and subtle sweetness.Important tips: What you need to know before eating arbiRaw arbi contains tiny needle-like crystals called calcium oxalate, which can irritate your mouth or throat. That’s why always cook it well before eating. Boiling, steaming, or frying will break down these crystals and make it safe and delicious.If you have a history of kidney stones, it’s best to eat arbi in moderation because of its oxalate content.Also read | Is eating avocados daily safe?

Kidney cleansing and detoxing myths: What you should know
Kidney detoxes are popular, but the kidneys naturally filter blood and remove waste. Detox teas and juices lack scientific support and may harm kidney function. While hydration is important, excessive water intake can strain kidneys. A balanced diet, regular exercise, and managing underlying conditions are proven ways to support kidney health.

Detox teas and juices lack scientific support and may harm kidney function. While hydration is important, excessive water intake can strain kidneys. A balanced diet, regular exercise, and managing underlying conditions are proven ways to support kidney health.  Kidney detoxes and cleansing routines have become increasingly popular, often promoted as quick solutions to improve kidney health, remove toxins, or boost overall wellness. From herbal teas to juice fasts, many of these methods promise results that sound too good to be true. The truth is that your kidneys are already excellent at detoxifying your body without any special interventions. Misunderstanding how the kidneys work can lead to unnecessary or even harmful health practices. Falling for these myths may not only waste your time and money but also put your kidney health at risk.What kidney detox myths get wrong about your healthMyth 1: Your kidneys need regular cleansingOne of the most widespread health myths is the idea that your kidneys need to be cleansed or flushed with specific drinks or diets. In reality, healthy kidneys continuously filter your blood, remove waste products, and balance your body's fluids and electrolytes. They do this naturally and efficiently. Unless your kidneys are damaged or diseased, they do not require any external cleansing. The best way to support them is through good nutrition, proper hydration, and regular health checks.Myth 2: Detox teas and juices can repair or improve kidney functionDetox teas, juices, and supplements often claim to remove toxins or enhance kidney function, but these claims are not supported by scientific evidence. Many of these products are unregulated and may contain high levels of certain herbs or diuretics that can stress the kidneys rather than help them. In some cases, they may lead to dehydration or mineral imbalances. If you have any kidney condition, these types of detoxes may do more harm than good.Myth 3: Drinking more water always helps cleanse the kidneysWhile staying hydrated is important for kidney function, more water is not always better. Drinking too much water can dilute essential salts in the body and place strain on the kidneys. People with healthy kidneys should aim to drink according to their body's needs, which can vary based on activity level, environment, and individual health conditions. For most people, drinking when thirsty and monitoring the colour of urine is enough to stay well hydrated.Myth 4: A kidney cleanse helps remove kidney stonesSome believe that consuming large amounts of citrus juice or herbal drinks can flush out kidney stones or prevent their formation. While drinking water and maintaining a balanced diet can help prevent stones in some cases, a true kidney cleanse will not dissolve or remove existing stones. Treatment for kidney stones depends on their size and type and often requires medical supervision. Relying on home remedies could delay proper care and increase the risk of complications.What really supports your kidney healthThe kidneys thrive when you take care of your overall health. The following lifestyle choices are proven to support kidney function:Eat a balanced diet that is low in sodium and processed foodsLimit your intake of red meat and animal fatsStay physically active and maintain a healthy weightAvoid smoking and limit alcohol consumptionManage underlying conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetesStay hydrated without overdoing itAvoid overuse of painkillers and unnecessary supplementsThese habits can help protect your kidneys from damage and reduce your risk of developing chronic kidney disease.Also read | Urine colour and kidney problems: Signs you shouldn’t ignoreAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Overconsumption may lead to digestive issues and weight gain due to their high calorie and fiber content. Avocados can also interfere with blood-thinning medications because of their vitamin K levels and potentially trigger migraines in susceptible individuals.  Avocados are a popular superfood known for their creamy texture and rich nutrient profile, including healthy fats, fibre, and vitamins. However, despite their benefits, avocados can cause side effects in some people. Allergic reactions, particularly among those with latex allergies, are common. Overconsumption may lead to digestive issues like bloating and gas, especially in individuals with sensitive stomachs or IBS. Due to their high calorie content, excessive intake can contribute to weight gain. Avocados also contain vitamin K, which may interfere with blood-thinning medications. Additionally, they can trigger migraines in susceptible individuals. Eating avocados in moderation and consulting a healthcare provider is advisable.Risks and side effects of eating avocados daily1. Allergic reactionsSome individuals may experience allergic reactions after consuming avocados. Symptoms can range from mild itching and skin rashes to more severe reactions like breathing difficulties or anaphylaxis. People with latex allergies are at a higher risk of developing an avocado allergy due to cross-reactivity .From Avocado to Zinc: Key nutrients for healthy skin and how to get them2.

Low levels can cause tingling and numbness. It may also lead to balance problems and memory loss. If not treated, nerve damage can become permanent. Vegans and older adults are at higher risk. Blood tests can check B12 levels. Treatment includes supplements or injections. Early action is key to prevent lasting harm.  Vitamin B12 plays a vital role in maintaining the health of the nervous system, including the brain, nerves, and spinal cord. A deficiency in this essential nutrient can lead to a range of neurological symptoms, such as tingling, numbness, poor coordination, memory loss, and mood changes. If left untreated, prolonged vitamin B12 deficiency may result in irreversible nerve damage. This is particularly concerning as neurological symptoms can appear before signs of anaemia. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent long-term complications. Regular monitoring and a balanced diet or supplementation can help maintain healthy B12 levels and protect nerve health.What is Vitamin B12: Signs of deficiency that affects nerve healthVitamin B12 (also known as cobalamin) helps produce red blood cells, supports DNA synthesis, and plays a key role in maintaining healthy nerve cells. It’s naturally found in animal-based foods such as meat, fish, eggs, and dairy. People following plant-based diets, or those with medical conditions affecting absorption, are most at risk of developing a deficiency.Vitamin B12 rich foods for vegetarian dietVitamin B12 deficiency can lead to neurological symptoms even before blood levels drop enough to cause anaemia. Common nerve-related signs include:Tingling or numbness in the hands, feet, or legsBalance issues or frequent fallsWeakness in musclesMemory loss or difficulty concentratingMood changes, including depression or irritabilityBurning sensations in extremitiesCoordination problems while walkingThese symptoms may begin subtly but can worsen over time, especially if not addressed early.How low Vitamin B12 causes nerve damageVitamin B12 is vital for the production of myelin – the protective coating around nerves. When B12 is deficient, myelin begins to break down, exposing nerves to damage. This can disrupt communication between the brain and the rest of the body, resulting in symptoms like numbness, weakness, and cognitive issues.In severe cases, B12 deficiency can lead to subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, a serious neurological condition that may cause:Stiffness in the limbsPoor coordinationDifficulty walkingLoss of vibration or position senseIf untreated, some of this nerve damage may become permanent.Who is at risk of Vitamin B12 deficiencyVitamin B12 deficiency can affect anyone, but some groups are more vulnerable:Older adults (reduced absorption with age)Vegans and vegetarians (plant foods lack natural B12)People with gastrointestinal conditions, such as Crohn’s disease or coeliac diseaseThose taking certain medications, like metformin or proton pump inhibitorsPatients who have had bariatric or stomach surgeryTreatment options for VitaminB12 deficiency typically includes:Vitamin B12 injections for severe deficiency or poor absorptionOral B12 supplements for mild casesDietary changes to include B12-rich or fortified foodsImprovements may take weeks or months depending on how long the deficiency has been present.When to see a doctorIf you experience symptoms like persistent numbness, tingling, balance issues, or mental fog, speak to your GP. A simple blood test can check your B12 levels. Your doctor may also test homocysteine or methylmalonic acid (MMA) if results are borderline.Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent long-term nerve damage.Frequently Asked QuestionsQ1. Can nerve damage from low B12 be reversed?Yes, but only if caught early. Many symptoms, including fatigue, tingling, and memory issues, often improve with treatment. However, long-term deficiency can lead to irreversible nerve damage, especially in older adults.Q2. Is nerve damage from low vitamin B12 permanent?Nerve damage may be reversible if treated early, but long-term deficiency can cause permanent damage. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential.Also read | Why kidney infections spike during the monsoon season and how to stay safeAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

But what you eat first really shapes how your whole day feels, your energy, digestion, and even your mood. That’s where basi roti with ghee quietly shines. It’s basically leftover or slightly fermented whole wheat flatbread, which might not sound exciting, but it’s actually a smart way to cut down on food waste and save a few bucks. In places like UP and Bihar, folks often enjoy it with jaggery, a simple, comforting combo that’s part of everyday life. Add a generous smear of ghee, and it turns into a warm, satisfying breakfast that keeps you going through the busiest mornings. Practical, wholesome, and honestly pretty comforting, it’s a breakfast worth bringing back. Scroll down to discover five simple reasons why basi roti with ghee makes such a great breakfast.”    2/6Basi roti prevents wastage     Let’s be honest, throwing away food just doesn’t sit right with most of us. Basi roti is one of those things that often gets forgotten and tossed, but why waste it? Instead, turn those dry rotis into your new go-to breakfast. It’s an easy way to cut down on waste, save a bit of cash, and still enjoy a warm, comforting meal that actually fills you up. Plus, with everyone talking about being smarter with food these days, basi roti with ghee feels like a small but meaningful way to eat better and live a little kinder.     3/6Gut health gets a delicious boost    Fermented foods have been all the rage for gut health, and basi roti fits right in. That slight fermentation happening in basi roti actually promotes good bacteria in your gut, helping digestion and keeping things running smoothly. Then there’s ghee, which isn’t just tasty – it contains butyrate, a fatty acid known for soothing your digestive tract and reducing inflammation. Together, basi roti and ghee are like a gentle comfort for your gut first thing in the morning.    4/6Steady energy without the crash    If you’re sick of breakfasts that shoot your sugar up and then leave you crashing, basi roti is a total game changer. Since it’s made from whole wheat, it gives you slow, steady energy instead of that quick spike. And when you spread some ghee on top, those good fats help keep you full and focused for way longer. No more sneaking snacks by mid-morning or crashing hard. Just steady energy that stays with you, making it easier to power through your day without any sugar slump.    5/6Filling but easy on your stomach    Nobody wants to feel heavy or slow right after breakfast. Basi roti’s got plenty of fiber from the whole wheat, so it keeps you full without that annoying hunger creeping back too soon. Plus, since it’s a bit fermented, it’s easier on your stomach than fresh bread. Toss on a good spoonful of ghee, and it’s warm, comforting, and just the right amount of filling. It’s the kind of breakfast that just sits right with you and gives you steady energy to power through your morning without feeling wiped out.    6/6Quick and convenient     We all have mornings when time is not on our side. That’s where basi roti shines. Since it’s already made (just leftover from yesterday’s meal), all you need to do is warm it up, add on a generous dollop of ghee, and you’re set. No fancy prep, no complicated recipes. This simple breakfast is perfect for anyone juggling a packed schedule but refusing to sacrifice nutrition.Follow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousHow to make natural hair colour using tea and coffeeindiaDivyanka Tripathi’s top 10 stylish must-have looksindia​How to make dhaba-style Egg Curry at home​Food9 heart-healthy foods that cut attack and stroke riskindiaSaniya Iyappan steals the spotlight with her graceindiaCarrie Coon’s secret weapon on TV?

The circulatory process needs blood to return from your feet and legs to your heart through veins, which require working against gravitational forces. The calf muscles function as a crucial system in this process. These muscles function by contracting and relaxing to compress deep leg veins, which pushes blood toward an upward direction. The calf muscle pump function prevents blood from accumulating in your legs, while maintaining normal blood pressure levels. Blood clots and swelling along with heart strain, become more likely when calf muscles are weak or inactive.Enhanced calf muscle strength enables the heart to operate more efficiently while reducing blood pressure, and enhancing overall circulation patterns. Your calf muscles become ready for walking or exercise, when you strengthen them before physical activities, thus minimising the risk of injuries and delivering additional protection to your heart. Here are 3 such exercises...3/5Calf Raises (Heel Raises)Calf raises serve to develop both gastrocnemius and soleus muscles which are primary calf muscle groups.How to do them:Stand with your feet placed hip-width apart while using a wall or chair as support for balance if required.Slowly lift your heels off the floor, rising onto your tiptoes.Maintain this position for one brief moment to feel the calf muscles tightening.Slowly lower your heels back down to the ground.Repeat 15-20 times for 2-3 sets.Why it’s good:Calf raises engage the blood-pumping muscles, which enhance the venous return process. Regular muscle contractions through these exercises, help expand blood vessels and create blood pressure reduction effects. Before starting your walk, these exercises prepare your muscles which then become more powerful, at supporting your cardiovascular system.4/5Seated calf raisesThis exercise targets the soleus muscle, which plays a key role during activities like walking and standing.How to do them:Sit comfortably on a chair with your feet flat on the ground.You should maintain contact between your toes, foot balls, heels and floor, as you elevate your heels to their highest point.Maintain the raised position for one to two seconds, before slowly returning your heels to the floor.Repeat 15-20 times for 2-3 sets.Why it’s good:The exercise of seated calf raises provides a gentle yet effective way to strengthen the muscles, which efficiently pump blood throughout daily activities. The exercise enhances blood flow and minimises leg heaviness and swelling symptoms. This stretch before walking helps protect your heart function during exercise.5/5Calf stretch with wall supportThe practice of calf muscle stretching leads to better flexibility, while improving blood circulation to avoid muscle tightness and injuries.How to do it:Stand an arm’s length away from a wall.Place your hands flat against the wall for support.Take a step backward with one straight foot, while pressing the heel against the floor.Lower your front knee slightly and press against the wall, until you reach the stretch in your calf muscle.Maintain the stretch position for 15 to 20 seconds.Perform this stretch 2 to 3 times on each leg before changing sides.Why it’s good:Stretching allows blood flow to increase, and relaxes the calf muscles before exercise begins. Your ability to walk correctly along with cramp prevention, depends on flexible calf muscles. The stretching process improves blood circulation, which benefits heart health by making blood flow back to your heart more easily.Sources:Aster Hospitals – Calf Muscles and Heart HealthSurrey Physio – 5 Best Ways to Strengthen Your CalvesWebMD – Best Exercises for Strengthening Calf MusclesMoneycontrol – How Calf Muscles Can Keep Cardiovascular Disease at BayDisclaimer: This article is informational only and not a substitute for medical adviceFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousHow to make natural hair colour using tea and coffeeindiaDivyanka Tripathi’s top 10 stylish must-have looksindia​How to make dhaba-style Egg Curry at home​Food9 heart-healthy foods that cut attack and stroke riskindiaSaniya Iyappan steals the spotlight with her graceindiaCarrie Coon’s secret weapon on TV?

Your muscles will become stronger while developing better definition, when you jump. The repetitive jumping motion during skipping rope exercises, delivers mild bone-stimulating pressure, which leads to bone growth while reducing osteoporosis risk  Actor and fitness enthusiast Milind Soman, 59 seems to be ageing like fine wine. Whether it is his fit frame, or his awe inspiring fitness videos, the actor goes on to prove that growing older has nothing to do with feeling older. Recently he took to his IG handle to share a family video of himself, his wife Ankita and mom Usha Soman who are all skipping together. Along with the video he revealed that at 86, his Aai (mom) skips everyday for health and fitness. He said, “Family skipping time. Aai (Mother) is now 86, and skipping is something she does every day, apart from yoga and other movements. Long life, health and happiness to all,” Milind wrote in the caption of the post.5 benefits of skipping ropeSkipping rope, though basic, delivers various health advantages to people. Regular rope skipping practices both enhance fitness while delivering benefits to your heart together with your muscles and are also good for your mental health, when combined with other activities. Here's how...Boosts cardiovascular healthThe physical activity of jumping rope is an excellent cardiovascular exercise, which develops both heart and lung strength. Your heart beats faster during rope jumping, which leads to better blood circulation and stronger heart muscles. Research shows that consistent rope skipping practice lowers blood pressure while reducing heart disease risks, through improved lung and heart performance. Your body will function more efficiently, because skipping rope enhances your cardiovascular ability, which supports extended health and active life.Improves coordination and balanceTo jump rope successfully, you need to maintain rhythm while controlling your body movements at precise times. Your brain and muscles work together during skipping, to maintain your balance and coordination. The activity develops your total motor abilities and boosts your agility levels, as well as your reaction speed. Scientific research demonstrates that rope skipping enhances balance, coordination and athletic performance amongst children and athletes. Not only that, the improved coordination helps decrease the chances of falls and daily accidents that lead to injuries. (Research Journal of Pharmacy and Technology – Effect of skipping rope exercise on physical fitness, Elite Jumps Blog – Surprising Benefits of Jumping Rope)Strengthens muscles and bonesThe physical activity of skipping rope works all major muscle groups starting from your calves and thighs, then moves to your core and finally engages your arms. Your muscles will become stronger while developing better definition, when you jump. The repetitive jumping motion during skipping rope exercises, delivers mild bone-stimulating pressure, which leads to bone growth while reducing osteoporosis risk. The regular practice of rope skipping, enhances your leg muscle endurance and maintains bone health, which together create physical strength.Burns calories and aids weight lossThe high-intensity nature of rope skipping makes it an effective workout which burns calories swiftly. You can easily burn 10-15 calories per minute, when you skip rope based on how fast and intensely you jump. This activity works well for weight loss and maintaining proper body weight distribution. Rope skipping engages your entire body, which stimulates metabolic processes while providing daily fitness benefits through brief exercise sessions. (PMC – The effect of an 8-week rope skipping intervention on performance, Cleveland Clinic – 6 Benefits of Jumping Rope)Enhances mental health and reduces stressThe practice of skipping rope delivers dual benefits to both physical health, and mental wellness. Physical exercise boosts endorphin production which creates positive mood effects, while decreasing stress levels. The coordinated movements required for skipping create mental clarity and improved concentration ability. People use rope skipping as a stress relief method, to improve their mental state after working hours.Disclaimer: This article is informational only and not a substitute for medical adviceAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

From the wish-granting tree of Kalpavriksha to Shri Krishana’s favourite Kadamba, these unique trees have been revered for centuries. Let us take a look at them one by one2/5Banyan: Tree of lifeThe banyan tree often represents the Trimūrti, the three lords of cosmic creation, preservation, and destruction-namely, Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Shiva. It is often used for metaphorical reference in the Vedic scriptures written in ancient Sanskrit manuscripts. With its ever-spreading roots and branches, it is also symbolic of life and fertility in the Indian culture and is consequently worshipped by those who wish to have children. The revered banyan tree is never cut, and thus often grows over many acres.3/5Kadamba treeCommon Bur Flower or Kadam (Neolamarckia Cadamba) is a large, evergreen tree with beautiful & unique flowers. It is a fast-growing tree with a broad crown and is even planted sacredly near temples. In Hindu mythology, the Kadam tree is the favourite tree of Lord Krishna, who is usually depicted playing his flute under it. He also used to play with his friends under the Kadam tree in Vrindavan, using the unique globular flower of the tree. Hence, the tree is also known as Haripriya, God's favourite.4/5Bael: The medicinal plantThe bael is a slender, aromatic tree that bears a sweet, yellow-green fruit. It is a medicinal plant as well as a sacred tree. All parts of it are used for different healing purposes-the roots, leaves, and fruits-and it has proven effective in combating many different kinds of bacteria. It is known as “Sivadruma”, and the leaves are often offered to Lord Shiva, who is known to be particularly pleased by this tree. Baels have trifoliate leaves, i.e., a leaf structure of three, and this is sometimes thought to symbolize Siva’s trident or the Trimūrti, Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh.5/5Peepal: Tree of enlightenmentThis tree, also known as “Ashvatta,” is purportedly the most worshipped tree in India. Lord Krishna, the original incarnation of Lord Vishnu and the supreme lord of the universe according to the legends, identifies with the peepul in the sacred text Bhagavad Gita. He states, “Of all trees, I am the holy fig tree (Bhagavad Gita Verse 10.26).” In addition, the Hindus associate the roots of the tree with Lord Brahma (the creator of the universe), the trunk of the tree with Lord Vishnu (the protector and preserver), and the leaves of the tree with Lord Shiva (the destroyer).Follow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous10 animals that can survive intense radiationLifestyle10 Indian states with maximum number of National ParkstravelHow to make natural hair colour using tea and coffeeLifestyleDivyanka Tripathi’s top 10 stylish must-have lookstv​How to make dhaba-style Egg Curry at home​Food9 heart-healthy foods that cut attack and stroke riskLifestyleSaniya Iyappan steals the spotlight with her graceEntertainmentCarrie Coon’s secret weapon on TV?

Your heart sends warnings 12 years before a heart attack; here’s the sign most people miss and preventions steps you need to know now
Research reveals physical activity often decreases years before heart issues arise. A study shows moderate exercise declines about 12 years before diagnosis. This decline accelerates in the final two years. Doctors like Dr. Sudhir Kumar advise recognizing early stamina loss. Early detection allows for timely prevention and lifestyle changes. These interventions can prevent major cardiac events.

A study shows moderate exercise declines about 12 years before diagnosis. This decline accelerates in the final two years. Doctors like Dr. Sudhir Kumar advise recognizing early stamina loss. Early detection allows for timely prevention and lifestyle changes. These interventions can prevent major cardiac events.  Heart attacks are usually framed as sudden emergencies, but research shows they commonly follow a slow, silent buildup that begins long before pain or hospital alarms. A major analysis of CARDIA participants found that moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) — things like brisk walking, cycling or swimming — often starts a steady decline about 12 years before a cardiovascular diagnosis, with the pace accelerating in the final two years. Experts including Dr. Sudhir Kumar (Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad) warn that this gradual loss of stamina is frequently misread as normal ageing; spotting it early creates a large window for prevention, screening and targeted lifestyle or medical interventions that can avert major cardiac events. Physical activity often starts falling 12 years before heart disease: StudyThe paper titled “Trajectories of Physical Activity Before and After Cardiovascular Disease Events in CARDIA Participants” analysed physical activity data collected across decades from participants first enrolled in 1985–86. Researchers used repeated activity assessments (multiple timepoints through midlife) to model long-term trajectories and compare people who later developed cardiovascular disease (CVD) with those who did not.The key quantitative findings: MVPA began to decline, on average, roughly 12 years before a first CVD event; declines steeped in the two years immediately before diagnosis; and low activity levels tended to persist after the event, widening the gap versus peers who remained CVD-free. The study used CARDIA’s longitudinal design to reveal this long preclinical window rather than a single cross-sectional snapshot. CARDIA tracked moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) — activities that raise heart rate and breathing noticeably (brisk walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, sports). In practice, MVPA estimates came from validated activity questionnaires administered repeatedly; these give a life-course view rather than a one-off reading. Because changes emerged gradually over a decade, the timing matters: a single clinic visit that notes “low activity today” can miss whether someone is on a downward trajectory. Longitudinal decline, especially an accelerating fall in MVPA is the important signal researchers flagged. Changes that raise heart disease riskA sustained drop in MVPA is not just a lifestyle statistic; it maps to several physiologic changes that raise cardiovascular risk:Cardiac deconditioning: Less habitual activity reduces cardiac stroke volume and aerobic capacity, so daily exertion becomes harder.Endothelial and vascular changes: Lack of movement promotes poorer endothelial function and favours atherogenic plaque formation.Metabolic effects: Inactivity increases the risk of weight gain, insulin resistance and adverse lipid changes — all major drivers of atherosclerosis.Inflammation and autonomic imbalance: Sedentary behaviour links to low-grade inflammation and less favourable autonomic (heart rate variability) profiles.Together, these pathways mean a progressive drop in MVPA both reflects and contributes to the biological processes that eventually cause heart attacks or strokes. For public guidance, major health bodies emphasise staying active because of these mechanistic links. MVPA declines over time reflect race and gender inequalities in heart healthCARDIA authors also examined demographic patterns. While MVPA tended to decline across all groups with age, the trajectory and baseline levels differed by sex and race. Notably, the study found that Black women recorded consistently lower activity levels across adulthood, and certain groups showed more continuous declines — patterns that can concentrate cardiovascular risk in already disadvantaged populations. These findings imply prevention must be tailored: population-level recommendations are necessary but insufficient without culturally and structurally appropriate supports. Think longitudinally, not just cross-sectionally. A single “low activity” datapoint is less informative than a trend; clinicians should ask about changes in routine and stamina over years.Use risk tools alongside functional history. Tools such as the ASCVD Risk Estimator help assess 10-year risk, but trend information about MVPA can flag patients who might benefit from earlier screening or intervention. Act early. Declining MVPA constitutes a window for action — lifestyle counselling, targeted exercise support, and if indicated, medical risk-factor treatment (BP, lipids, glycemia). The earlier the intervention, the greater the chance of preventing an event. How to evaluate a patient’s steady decline in staminaIf a patient reports a steady, unexplained fall in activity or stamina, reasonable initial steps include:Basic cardiovascular screening: blood pressure, BMI/waist measure, lipid panel, fasting glucose/HbA1c. Calculate ASCVD or other validated risk scores (for patients in the appropriate age range) to guide intensity of preventive therapy. Functional assessment: a simple timed walk or effort-tolerance discussion can be very revealing; refer for formal stress testing only if clinical suspicion of ischemia is present. Consider social drivers: ask about work, caregiving, safety, access to safe walking spaces and time pressures — these often explain activity declines and must be addressed.From prevention to recovery: Practical guidelines for safe and sustainable cardiovascular fitnessPublic health and cardiology bodies recommend at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity (or 75 minutes of vigorous activity) as a baseline goal for adults; more gives additional benefit. Practical tips to meet and sustain MVPA:Break activity into short, consistent bouts (eg. , 30 minutes, 5 days/week).Choose enjoyable activities (walking, cycling, swimming, dance) to improve adherence.Build movement into routines (active commuting, stairs, standing breaks at work).Set trajectory goals rather than single-day targets (track weekly MVPA minutes).Address barriers (childcare, unsafe neighbourhoods, pain) with tailored solutions or supervised programs. If someone does have a cardiovascular event, the evidence strongly supports early referral to structured cardiac rehabilitation (CR). CR combines monitored exercise, risk-factor management, nutrition and psychosocial support; it reduces mortality and improves functional recovery. Typical guidance: begin activity gently (short walks) in hospital recovery, progress under supervision to 30+ minutes of aerobic activity several times weekly, and incorporate supervised outpatient CR when available.How to track activity trends (tools that help detect a worrying decline)Wearables and phone apps: track MVPA minutes and weekly totals. Look for a sustained downward slope over months/years, not day-to-day noise.Simple logs: a weekly activity diary or 6-minute walk distance recorded every few months provides a low-tech trend.Clinical prompts: clinicians should routinely ask, “Compared with two years ago, do you find doing your usual activities harder?” A “yes” can prompt further evaluation.Also Read | Boost liver function with this gut-friendly no-bake date bar supporting overall wellness; gastroenterologist shares easy homemade recipeAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Harry felt betrayed, believing the Palace prioritized William's reputation over protecting them from misinformation. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle/@Instagram Meghan Markle was left visibly shaken following the release of a statement by Buckingham Palace refuting allegations that Prince William bullied her and Prince Harry out of their royal duties. The couple has stated that the action came as a shock to them since it was released without Harry's consent and, in their opinion, did not depict their side of the story.The moment that sparked the debateIn the Netflix documentary Harry & Meghan, Harry recalled the moment he saw the statement and realised it had gone out without his consent. “No one had asked me for permission,” he said. When he told Meghan, she broke down. “She burst into floods of tears,” he added.The statement was issued by Buckingham Palace on behalf of both princes in January 2020, but according to Prince Harry in the Harry & Meghan documentary, he never agreed to it or even knew it was going out.The claim was intended to counter rumors that suggested William's conduct was a reason why the Duchess of Sussex had decided to step back from public life. Media speculations at the time were circulating over tensions in the palace. Harry believed that the palace was set to protect William's reputation, but failed to provide the same level of haste to defend him and Meghan from the spread of misinformation.For three years, they were never going to tell the truth to protect us," Harry said. "But within four hours, they were willing to lie to protect my brother." His words reflected the profound sense of betrayal he and Meghan felt afterwards.The episode is now routinely cited as among the pivotal moments that pushed the brothers further apart. Once close and united in their bereavement over their mother, Princess Diana, the princes have drifted apart. William continues to serve in his position in the UK, while Harry and Meghan have established a new life with their kids, Archie and Lilibet, in California.Signals of a possible rowCredit: InstagramNevertheless, there have been subtle hints that the chill in the air between the Sussexes and the remaining royal members may be dissipating. Rumors indicate a low-key encounter occurred in London amongst Harry's top PR communications adviser, Liam Maguire, his US counterpart, Meredith Maines, and King Charles's senior media aide, Tobyn Andreae. The encounter, held social style with drinks, allegedly was agenda-free. Instead, it gave a chance for honest dialogue, something that some insiders perceive as a good beginning.One insider characterized the meeting as a welcome moment of positive discussion after decades of tension. "There's a long road ahead, but a channel of communication is now open for the first time in years," the insider said. For Harry and Meghan, the recollection of being exposed and left vulnerable as a story they contest took hold is not likely to be forgotten soon.Whether or not this new avenue of communication will amount to genuine reconciliation is far from clear. The family's public and private spheres are so closely linked that rebuilding personal relationships tends to involve negotiating public opinion as well. At times like these, each word, each appearance, and each perceived silence can have enduring repercussions.The road aheadFor the time being, the controversy over the controversial comment remains a chilling reminder of the difficulties experienced by the Sussexes during their service as senior royals. It shows how disagreements in style and priorities within the royal family can have a profound emotional consequence, particularly when trust has been breached.If reconciliation is to happen, it will be more than a matter of one meeting. It will involve time, continued discussion, and a commitment from all parties to admit past resentments without allowing them to dictate the future.About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

How middle-class families can save INR 1.2 crore in 10 years, CA shares
CA Nitin Kaushik suggests that middle-class Indian families can accumulate INR 1.2 crores in 10 years through disciplined financial planning. His strategy involves early investment in SIPs and PPF for children, patient home buying with substantial down payments, and boosting retirement savings beyond EPF. Kaushik emphasizes consistent saving habits, avoiding lifestyle inflation, and tracking expenses to achieve financial goals.

His strategy involves early investment in SIPs and PPF for children, patient home buying with substantial down payments, and boosting retirement savings beyond EPF. Kaushik emphasizes consistent saving habits, avoiding lifestyle inflation, and tracking expenses to achieve financial goals.  For many middle-class Indian families, having a home of their own, enough funds to send kids to study abroad, savings of over INR 1.2 crores, and to retire with financial stability sounds like a dream. With modest incomes, rising costs of living, and unexpected expenses, saving big often feels impossible for many. But Chartered Accountant (CA) Nitin Kaushik believes otherwise.In a detailed post on X (formerly known as Twitter), CA Nitin Kaushik explained that with discipline, smart planning, and consistent investing habits, even people with average incomes can build a wealth of INR 1.2 crores in just 10 years. Here's how, as per Kaushik's post on X:1. Start financial planning earlyOne of Kaushik’s biggest tips is to set priorities from the start. For parents, this means beginning a child’s investment plan right from their birth. By investing just INR 10,000 per month — split between Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) in index funds and the Public Provident Fund (PPF) — parents can target to save upto INR 60 lakh in 15 years.The math works out through the power of compounding: Mutual funds can potentially earn about 12% annually, while PPF offers safety, tax benefits, and stable returns. Occasional top-ups boost the total even more.2. Buy a home without breaking your financesFor most Indians, owning a home is a major dream— but Kaushik advises people to be patient with it. Instead of jumping into a long-term home loan, families can initially rent while saving aggressively on the side. Aim to have at least 25% of the property price as a down payment before buying.When taking a loan, keep the tenure short (10 years instead of 20) and ensure EMIs don’t exceed 35% of your monthly income. This approach reduces interest costs, speeds up loan repayment, and leaves room for other investments.3. Start saving for your retirement nowRelying only on the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) is risky. Kaushik suggests gradually increasing contributions to the National Pension System (NPS) and running separate retirement-focused SIPs. The goal: build INR 30–35 lakh in retirement savings within 10 years. This diversified plan provides a safety net against inflation and unforeseen expenses.4. Small habits make big impactWealth is not just about how much you earn, but how consistently you save. Kaushik recommends:- Avoid lifestyle inflation (don’t let expenses grow just because your income does)- Track your spending with a simple spreadsheet- Delay going on expensive vacations until your savings goals are met- Celebrate milestones like hitting ₹5 lakh in SIP investments or prepaying loansThe 10-year outcomeBy following this plan, Kaushik says a typical family could achieve:INR 72 lakh from mutual fundsINR 28 lakh from PPF, EPF, and NPSINR 8 lakh in fixed deposits and emergency fundsINR 15 lakh in home equity (after loan adjustments)Even after accounting for liabilities such as a INR 22 lakh home loan balance, the net worth exceeds INR 1.2 crore in 10 years.Kaushik’s message is simple: Wealth is built slowly — through patience, consistent investing, and smart financial decisions — not by chasing quick profits. For middle-class families, starting early and staying disciplined can turn modest salaries into a strong financial future.About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Packed with antioxidants, healthy fats, and essential nutrients, they support heart health, boost brain function, and promote healthy digestion. Incorporating a moderate amount of hazelnuts into your daily diet can enhance overall well-being, contributing to stronger bones, glowing skin, and reduced inflammation.  Hazelnuts, also called filberts, are more than just a crunchy snack or a sweet ingredient in chocolate spreads. These nutrient-rich nuts are loaded with vitamins, minerals, healthy fats, and powerful antioxidants that make them a true superfood. From protecting your heart and boosting brain function to improving skin glow and supporting digestion, hazelnuts can benefit almost every part of your body. They are also a natural source of protein, fibre, and essential fatty acids, making them an excellent choice for those seeking a balanced and wholesome diet. Whether eaten raw, roasted, or blended into nut butter, adding a handful of hazelnuts to your daily routine can be a delicious way to improve your health and well-being.8 health benefits of hazelnuts to improve your over all health Hazelnuts are packed with antioxidantsStudies published in NIH have confirmed that hazelnuts are rich in vitamin E, manganese, and phenolic compounds, which act as powerful antioxidants. These help protect your cells from oxidative stress, slowing the ageing process and reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease.Surprisingly easy ways to protect your brain and prevent strokeSupport heart health and manage cholesterolStudies in NIH show hazelnuts promote better cholesterol balance by lowering LDL (bad) cholesterol and increasing HDL (good) cholesterol. High in monounsaturated fats and dietary fibre, this combination supports blood vessel flexibility, improves circulation, and reduces the risk of cardiovascular issues.Help regulate blood sugar levelsResearch by NIH confirms that the low glycaemic index of hazelnuts, combined with their magnesium content, supports blood sugar stability. Regular consumption can help those managing type 2 diabetes and may lower the risk of developing insulin resistance.Promote healthy digestionA small handful of hazelnuts provides enough dietary fibre to aid digestion, prevent constipation, and promote healthy gut bacteria. Good digestive health also supports nutrient absorption, ensuring your body makes the most of your meals.Boost brain health and cognitive functionHazelnuts provide essential nutrients for brain performance, including vitamin E, manganese, thiamine, and healthy fats. These nutrients protect brain cells, improve memory, and support sharper mental focus as you age.Enhance skin and hair healthVitamin E and healthy fats in hazelnuts nourish skin cells, helping maintain hydration and elasticity. They also protect against sun damage and oxidative stress. The same nutrients contribute to stronger, shinier hair.Reduce inflammation naturallyResearch by NIH shows that hazelnuts have anti-inflammatory compounds that may reduce chronic inflammation, a root cause of many serious conditions like heart disease, arthritis, and certain cancers.Strengthen bonesWith magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus, hazelnuts support bone density and strength. This makes them a valuable food for preventing osteoporosis and maintaining mobility as you age.How to Enjoy Hazelnuts SafelyHazelnuts may be a nutritional powerhouse, but like most nuts, they are calorie-dense, meaning it’s easy to overeat them without realising. To enjoy their health benefits without consuming excess calories, aim for a serving of 20–30 grams per day roughly a small handful. This amount is enough to provide essential vitamins, minerals, healthy fats, and antioxidants without significantly affecting your daily calorie balance.If you have a nut allergy, it’s best to avoid hazelnuts completely, as even small traces can trigger reactions. For everyone else, there are plenty of delicious ways to include them in your diet. You can eat them raw for maximum nutrient retention, roast them for a deeper flavour, sprinkle chopped hazelnuts over salads or yoghurt, blend them into smoothies for a creamy texture, or enjoy them as a natural hazelnut butter. Pairing hazelnuts with fresh fruit, dark chocolate, or whole grains can also create tasty, balanced snacks that keep you full for longer.From heart health and brain support to glowing skin, better digestion, and stronger bones, hazelnuts are a versatile superfood worth adding to your diet. Just remember, moderation is key. Enjoy them regularly as part of a balanced diet, and their benefits will reward you for years to come.Also read| 10 benefits of karela juice daily: Boost immunity, manage blood sugar, support digestionAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, it boosts immunity, aids digestion, and supports weight loss. Studies suggest it helps regulate blood sugar, detoxifies the liver, enhances skin health, and may possess anti-cancer properties. While beneficial, moderation is key to avoid potential side effects.   Karela juice, made from the humble bitter gourd, is one of those age-old remedies that has stood the test of time. Its sharp, bitter taste might make you wince, but behind that strong flavour lies a treasure chest of health benefits. For centuries, karela has been used in Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine to treat a variety of ailments, from digestive troubles to blood sugar imbalances. Today, modern nutrition science is catching up, recognising karela juice as a functional health drink rich in vitamins, minerals, fibre, and powerful plant compounds.When consumed regularly (in moderation), karela juice can help improve immunity, support healthy digestion, promote weight loss, and even enhance skin health. Whether you’re looking to manage blood sugar naturally or simply want a nutrient-packed drink to start your morning, karela juice can be a game-changer in your daily wellness routine. Let’s explore its top 10 health benefits.10 health benefits of drinking karela juice every dayBoosts immunity with vitamin c and zincAccording to a study in BMC, karela juice is a natural immune system ally. High in vitamin C, zinc, and flavonoids, it helps your body fight off infections more effectively. The antioxidants in karela juice neutralise free radicals, lowering inflammation and helping your body recover faster from illnesses. A regular intake can be particularly beneficial during seasonal changes when colds and flu are more common.Improves digestion and relieves bloatingBitter foods have long been valued for their ability to stimulate digestion, and karela juice is no exception. Its fibre content aids bowel regularity, while digestive enzymes in the juice encourage the breakdown of food for easier absorption. If you often experience bloating, gas, or indigestion, a small serving of karela juice before meals can help ease discomfort and improve nutrient uptake.Supports weight loss naturallyIf you’re aiming to lose weight without extreme diets, karela juice can be a supportive addition. It’s low in calories but rich in dietary fibre, which keeps you full for longer and curbs unnecessary snacking. Certain compounds in karela also help regulate blood sugar, preventing sudden spikes and crashes that often lead to sugar cravings. When paired with a balanced diet and regular exercise, it can accelerate fat loss in a healthy way.Helps regulate blood sugar levelsPerhaps the most famous benefit of karela juice is its role in blood sugar management. Studies by NIH confirmed that it contains compounds like charantin, vicine, and polypeptide-P — all of which mimic the effects of insulin, helping glucose enter cells more efficiently. This makes it a natural aid for people looking to keep their blood sugar within healthy ranges. However, if you’re on diabetes medication, consult your doctor before adding karela juice to your diet to avoid hypoglycemia.Protects cells from damage with antioxidantsOxidative stress is linked to premature ageing and chronic diseases, but karela juice’s antioxidant profile can help counter it. According to NIH’s studies, vitamins A and C, along with polyphenols, work together to protect cells from damage, maintain healthy tissues, and support overall vitality. Regular consumption may also reduce the risk of certain inflammatory conditions.Promotes liver detox and gut healthYour liver plays a key role in detoxification, and karela juice supports this vital process. It stimulates bile production, which aids fat digestion and helps the body eliminate toxins. A well-functioning liver not only supports digestion but also improves metabolism and overall energy levels.Enhances skin health and fights acneThe skin-clearing benefits of karela juice come from its detoxifying and anti-inflammatory properties. By flushing out toxins from the bloodstream, it reduces skin irritation, redness, and breakouts. It’s also rich in vitamin C, which supports collagen production, keeping skin firm and youthful. Regular drinkers often notice a brighter complexion over time.Shows potential anti-cancer propertiesEmerging research by NIH suggests that karela extract may have compounds that slow down the growth of certain cancer cells, particularly in the colon, liver, and breast. While karela juice is not a cure, its high antioxidant content and ability to support immune health may play a protective role when combined with a nutrient-rich diet.Provides antimicrobial and antiviral benefitsKarela juice contains bioactive compounds with antibacterial and antiviral effects, helping to protect against infections. Traditionally, it has been used to fight intestinal worms and improve gut microbial balance. In modern times, this property adds to its role in supporting immunity.Aids wound healing in diabeticsSome studies by NIH show that karela juice can promote wound healing, especially in people with diabetes. By improving blood circulation and reducing inflammation, it supports tissue repair and recovery. However, this should be used as a complementary remedy, not a replacement for medical treatment.Karela juice is a powerful natural remedy, but like all good things, it should be consumed in moderation. Its benefits range from strengthening immunity and aiding weight loss to improving skin health and supporting digestion. However, overconsumption may cause digestive discomfort, diarrhoea, or dangerously low blood sugar levels, especially for those on diabetic medication. Pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid it without medical advice. For safe consumption, start with 30–50 ml diluted in water a few times a week and gradually increase if needed. Its bitter flavour may take time to get used to, but when enjoyed regularly and in moderation, karela juice can be a valuable addition to a balanced, healthy lifestyle.Also read| 7 best green teas to support weight management and overall healthAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Experts recommend simple lifestyle tweaks for better rest. These include changing pillow covers weekly, avoiding evening caffeine and heavy late meals, limiting screen time, and maintaining a consistent bedtime routine. These adjustments promote relaxation, boost melatonin, and support the body's natural sleep-wake cycle.  Good sleep isn’t a luxury, it’s a vital part of maintaining physical health, emotional balance, and mental clarity. Yet, millions of people struggle with falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up refreshed. The problem isn’t always the number of hours you spend in bed, but the quality of those hours. Sleep experts highlight that small daily habits, like when you drink your coffee or how often you change your pillow cover, can have a surprisingly big impact on how well you rest. By making a few simple changes, you can improve your sleep quality, enhance your energy levels during the day, and even boost your overall immunity. Here are five expert-recommended lifestyle tweaks that can help you sleep better, starting tonight.5 habits to change for a restful night’s sleep naturallyChange your pillow cover regularly for better sleep qualityAccording to a study published in sleep foundation, clean pillow cover supports both hygiene and restful sleep. Over time, pillowcases collect dust mites, allergens, skin oils, and sweat, all of which can trigger discomfort, respiratory irritation, or even mild allergic reactions. These irritations may cause restless nights or frequent wake-ups. Washing or replacing your pillow cover at least once a week creates a fresher, healthier sleep environment, helping your body relax more easily into deep, restorative rest.Avoid evening caffeine to improve sleep qualityStudies done by sleep foundation have shown that caffeine is a stimulant that can stay in your system for up to eight hours. Even a late-afternoon coffee, tea, or energy drink can delay sleep onset and reduce deep sleep stages. For better sleep, cut off caffeine at least six hours before bedtime. Switch to herbal teas, warm milk, or simply water in the evenings to allow your nervous system to wind down naturally.Skip heavy meals before bed for better digestion and sleepEating heavy, rich, or spicy meals late at night forces your body to focus on digestion instead of relaxation. This can cause indigestion, bloating, or acid reflux, all of which disturb sleep quality. To improve both digestion and sleep, try finishing dinner at least two to three hours before bedtime. If you feel hungry later, opt for a light snack like a banana or a handful of nuts.Limit screen time to boost sleep qualityResearch by sleep foundation has confirmed that exposure to blue light from phones, TVs, and laptops suppresses melatonin production, the hormone that signals your body it’s time to sleep. By scrolling in bed or watching late-night shows, you’re telling your brain to stay alert. For better sleep, switch off all screens at least an hour before bedtime. Instead, choose activities like reading a book, meditating, or gentle stretching to help your body prepare for rest.Follow a consistent bedtime routine for long-term sleep improvementYour body’s internal clock, or circadian rhythm, thrives on consistency. Going to bed and waking up at the same time each day reinforces your natural sleep-wake cycle, making it easier to fall asleep and wake up without feeling groggy. Include calming rituals like a warm shower, soft music, or journaling in your nightly routine to signal your body that it’s time to wind down.Quick recap table for sleep improvementHabitChange to makeHow it helps sleep qualityPillow hygieneWash/replace weeklyReduces allergens and discomfortEvening caffeineAvoid after afternoonHelps you fall asleep fasterHeavy late mealsEat 2–3 hours before bedPrevents digestive discomfortScreen exposureStop 1 hour before bedBoosts melatonin productionIrregular sleep scheduleKeep consistent routineSupports circadian rhythmImproving your sleep quality doesn’t always require medical intervention or drastic lifestyle changes. By making these five adjustments, keeping your bedding fresh, skipping evening caffeine, avoiding late heavy meals, limiting screen time, and committing to a consistent bedtime routine, you give your body the right environment for deep, restorative rest. Try implementing one change at a time, and you may find yourself not only sleeping better but also feeling more energized, focused, and balanced during the day.Also read| Why you shouldn’t shower right after eating: Lifestyle coach reveals the impact on digestionAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Why you shouldn’t shower right after eating: Lifestyle coach reveals the impact on digestion
Lifestyle coach Luke Coutinho advises against showering immediately after meals, as it diverts blood flow from the digestive system, potentially hindering nutrient absorption and causing discomfort. Waiting 90-120 minutes post-meal or showering beforehand allows for optimal digestion, especially beneficial for those with gut sensitivities. This simple adjustment can improve energy levels and overall gut health.

Waiting 90-120 minutes post-meal or showering beforehand allows for optimal digestion, especially beneficial for those with gut sensitivities. This simple adjustment can improve energy levels and overall gut health.  Many of us enjoy a relaxing shower after a meal, thinking it helps us feel refreshed but this everyday habit could be secretly harming your digestion. Lifestyle coach Luke Coutinho, in a recent Instagram post, warned that showering immediately after eating can interfere with the body’s natural digestive process. When you eat, your body increases blood flow to the stomach, activates digestive enzymes, and works to regulate temperature for optimal breakdown of food. Stepping into the shower too soon diverts this focus, which can be especially troublesome for those dealing with bloating, acid reflux, IBS, or sluggish digestion. The fix is simple: shower before meals or wait 90–120 minutes afterward to give your gut the time it needs to do its job efficiently.Why showering after meals affects digestionBlood flow diversionWhen you eat, your body prioritises sending blood to the stomach and intestines to break down food and absorb nutrients. A hot shower draws blood toward the skin’s surface to help regulate temperature, reducing the supply to your digestive system. A cold shower can cause the opposite, narrowing blood vessels and restricting circulation. In both cases, the stomach gets less support, slowing digestion and potentially causing discomfort.Greater impact on sensitive gutsPeople with existing gut health problems, such as gastritis, IBS, chronic acidity, or constipation are more likely to feel the negative effects. Disrupting digestion early can trigger bloating, heaviness, or acid reflux, making recovery from gut issues more difficult.Temperature regulation interferenceDigestion slightly increases your body’s core temperature. Sudden exposure to very hot or cold water forces your system to shift focus toward temperature control instead of digestion. Over time, this repeated interference could lead to poor nutrient absorption and inflammation.How to adjust your shower habits for better digestionTo protect your digestive health, it’s worth making a few simple changes to your shower routine. Ideally, take a shower before meals, especially before heavy lunches or dinners, so your body can focus entirely on breaking down food afterward. If showering before eating isn’t possible, wait at least 90–120 minutes after a meal. This window gives your stomach and intestines time to process food, release enzymes, and absorb nutrients without interference. Even if you don’t have gut issues, limiting post-meal showers to occasional situations is wise. Making this adjustment not only supports digestion but also helps maintain steady energy levels, reduces the risk of bloating, and promotes overall gut health in the long run.Benefits of waiting before showeringBetter nutrient absorption, uninterrupted blood flow ensures your body uses vitamins and minerals effectively.Reduced post-meal fatigue, avoiding a shower right after eating can help you feel less sluggish and more alert.Improved metabolism, a smoother digestive process supports balanced energy and weight management.How to make the habit change easyPlan your schedule so you shower in the morning before breakfast or later in the day well after meals.After workouts, cool down first and wait before eating or showering to avoid overlapping stress on digestion.Use the waiting period after meals for light activity such as walking, gentle stretching, or reading, these can actually enhance digestion.Summary table: Shower timing and digestionHabitRecommended ChangeWhy It HelpsShowering immediately after mealsWait 90–120 minutesKeeps blood flow focused on digestionLong hot showers post-mealReduce temperature or delayPrevents excessive vasodilationCold showers right after eatingDelay until digestion startsAvoids blood vessel constrictionShowering before eatingMaintain as a habitPrepares the body for smooth digestionShowering after meals may seem harmless, but as Luke Coutinho points out, it can subtly slow down your digestion and reduce gut health efficiency over time. This is especially important for people with sensitive digestive systems. By making a simple change, showering before meals or waiting at least 90–120 minutes afterward, you can support better nutrient absorption, reduce digestive discomfort, and keep your energy levels steady. Sometimes, it’s these small, mindful adjustments that deliver the biggest long-term health benefits.Also read| Childhood obesity linked to colon cancer risk: Why parents should take early weight gain seriouslyAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

These bars are a healthy alternative to store-bought sweets. They are rich in fibre, healthy fats, and antioxidants. The key ingredients include Medjool dates, nut butter, almonds, pistachios, and dark chocolate. The recipe involves layering these ingredients and chilling. These bars support digestive health, liver function, and sustained energy.  Craving something sweet but don’t want to derail your healthy eating plan? No-bake date bars are the perfect solution — a naturally sweet, nutrient-rich snack that’s quick to prepare and loaded with health benefits. Recently, gastroenterologist Dr Joseph Salhab shared his recipe for this wholesome dessert on Instagram, highlighting how it can be both gut-friendly and liver-supportive.By combining dates, almonds, pistachios, and dark chocolate, this recipe delivers a satisfying treat that’s high in fibre, healthy fats, and antioxidants, without the need for refined sugar or baking.Signs that all is not well with your liverWhy no-bake date bars are a healthier dessert choice; gastroenterologists explainsMost store-bought sweets are loaded with processed sugar, preservatives, and unhealthy fats. Date-based bars, on the other hand, offer a more natural alternative.Dates provide prebiotic fibre, which feeds the beneficial bacteria in your gut, helping maintain digestive health.Nuts such as almonds and pistachios supply healthy fats, protein, and essential micronutrients like vitamin E, magnesium, and zinc.Dark chocolate (70% cocoa or higher) is rich in flavonoids, powerful antioxidants that may improve heart and liver function.Dr Salhab points out that this combination not only satisfies cravings but also supports overall wellness, making these bars suitable as a snack or dessert.No-bake-date bars: Key ingredients and their nutritional benefitsMedjool dates Medjool dates are naturally sweet, eliminating the need for added sugar. They are a rich source of fibre, potassium, magnesium, and antioxidants that help regulate digestion, support energy production, and protect against oxidative stress.Nut butter Nut butters like almond or peanut butter add a creamy texture and are packed with monounsaturated fats that promote heart health. They also provide protein for satiety and muscle repair.Almonds and Pistachios Both almonds and pistachios are excellent sources of healthy fats, plant protein, vitamin E, and minerals. These nutrients support liver detoxification and help keep cholesterol levels balanced.Dark Chocolate Choosing 70% cocoa or higher ensures your chocolate is rich in flavonoids, which can help reduce inflammation, improve blood flow, and protect liver cells from damage.No-bake date bars recipe at home: Step-by-step processStep 1 – Prepare the baseRemove the pits from approximately 14 Medjool dates. Line a baking tin with parchment paper and press the dates into an even, flat layer to form the base.Step 2 – Add the creamy layerSpread ¼ cup of your favourite nut butter evenly over the date base. This acts as a binding layer while adding a smooth, rich flavour.Step 3 – Add crunch with nutsSprinkle two handfuls of almonds and one handful of pistachios over the nut butter. You can lightly crush them for an even texture or keep them whole for extra crunch.Step 4 – Melt the chocolateMelt 250g of vegan dark chocolate (preferably 70%+ cocoa) over low heat or using a double boiler. Pour the melted chocolate over the nut layer and smooth it out.Step 5 – Chill until setPlace the tin in the fridge for about 40 minutes, or until the chocolate has fully hardened.Step 6 – Slice and enjoyCut into bars of your preferred size. Store in an airtight container in the fridge and enjoy whenever you need a healthy snack.Storage tips for no-bake date bars freshnessFor maximum freshness and texture, keep your no-bake date bars in the refrigerator. The cold setting ensures the chocolate remains firm, and the nuts stay crisp. They can last up to 10–14 days when stored properly.Health benefits of eating date barsSupports digestive health – High fibre content aids digestion and promotes a healthy gut microbiome.Boosts liver function – Healthy fats and antioxidants assist in liver detoxification.Provides sustained energy – Balanced combination of carbs, fats, and protein keeps you fuller for longer.Reduces sugar cravings – Naturally sweetened with dates, reducing dependency on refined sugar.Also Read | She lost 140 kg without surgery or supplements—now a rare disease has turned her scars into a symbol of strengthAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Planning to Study in the U.S.? Here’s everything student travellers need to know from visa guidelines to new changes
In 2025, the U.S. implemented significant policy shifts impacting international students. These changes include mandatory public social media profiles for visa applicants, stricter vetting processes, and potential alterations to authorized stay calculations. Applicants should maintain clean online records, apply early, and stay updated through official government websites to navigate these evolving regulations.

Here’s everything student travellers need to know from visa guidelines to new changesetimes.in / Updated: Aug 11, 2025, 16:42 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLargeIn 2025, the U.S. implemented significant policy shifts impacting international students. These changes include mandatory public social media profiles for visa applicants, stricter vetting processes, and potential alterations to authorized stay calculations. Applicants should maintain clean online records, apply early, and stay updated through official government websites to navigate these evolving regulations.  U.S.is home to some reputed universities in the world and has been attracting global students for a long time now. However, in 2025 there have been some major policy shifts that have impacted the education industry as a whole. The U.S. policy makers have made a lot of changes. From making social media accounts public and pausing and resuming visa interviews to offering fixed-term eligibility under proposal, and increasing visa fees, the changes are endless and confusing too.So let’s try to understand the new changes:Make Social Media Public Amid several ongoing changes, the U.S. asked students wanting to study in American universities to make their social media profiles public because public persona matters. The new change was implemented from June 18, 2025. So now, applicants for F (academic), M (vocational), and J (exchange) visas should submit their social media accounts and set their accounts on public mode. The officers will check and scrutinise posts and other shared content of the applicants. This year, the federal government updated visa vetting and processing policies. Let’s have a look at why it matters and how is it going to impact students:The new changesThe Department of State in 2025 announced the plans of expanding visa screening. It very clearly mentioned the applicants’ online presence matter to the ‘getting whole visa’ process calling it a part of consular vetting. The Department called it an “expanded screening and vetting” process. The Department of State also updated its interview-waiver guidance. It changed to which applicants may be eligible for an in-person interview waiver. The Department also narrowed categories eligible for waiver in several cases. It means that more visa applicants should expect to attend an in-person interview unless they meet the specific waiver criteria. How will these changes impact students?Increased documentation and strict review: The new changes mean more documentations and a strict review process. The reviewers can request more personal information. They can also look beyond transcripts and bank statements and survey the applicant’s public online history and activity. More in-person questions during the interview: With the new interview-waiver rules, applicants should expect to attend consular interviews. Expect delays. Expect changes to authorized stay: If U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) finalises a fixed-term admission rule, the way students’ authorized stay is calculated would also change in future. It will affect program planning, transfers, and some employment authorizations tied to enrollment length. This is a significant move as it can change the “duration of status” system—where F visas remain valid as long as students maintain course enrollment.What current applicants/students must keep in mindKeep checking official sites only: The potential applicants must keep themselves updated with current changes on the official websites of the State Department, DHS/ICE (SEVP), and USCIS. These pages are for authoritative updates rather than unofficial commentary. Official pages have guidance, timelines, and eligibility rules as well. Do not trust any other website. Keep your record clean: Now that it is mandatory to keep your social media profile open, it is necessary for applicants to keep their record clean and monitor their online presence. Also remember that officials will only believe public information and official records.Apply early and book interviews: It is important to maintain the timeline. Apply early and book interviews as there are higher chances of required in-person interviews. Schedule embassy or consulate appointments the moment you get your Form I-20 or DS-2019. Allow buffer time: Keep extra or buffer time for program completion and other administrative steps. Keep copies of all documents and paperwork. Now that U.S. agencies are more concerned about vetting and tightening the conditions, expect delays and keep extra time and other options ready. These changes are official and mentioned on DHS/SEVP, and USCIS guidance. Keep in touch with your universities who can offer better explanations and guidance. (Official sources used here include: U.S. Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, ICE SEVP (SEVIS and program guidance), and USCIS (student classifications and employment rules).End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous10 quotes on marriages by Swami Premanand Ji MaharajLifestyleSharvari Wagh brings charm to every pink detailEntertainment10 animals that can survive intense radiationLifestyleHow to make natural hair colour using tea and coffeeLifestyleDivyanka Tripathi’s top 10 stylish must-have lookstv9 heart-healthy foods that cut attack and stroke riskLifestyleSaniya Iyappan steals the spotlight with her graceEntertainmentCarrie Coon’s secret weapon on TV?

If Virat Kohli was the poster boy for sporty-meets-slick dressing in the last decade, Gill is the Gen-Z evolution: a blend of quiet luxury, streetwear confidence, and just the right amount of boyish charm.From airport runs to ad campaigns, his wardrobe choices tell us one thing, Shubman knows the game when it comes to style just as much as he does cricket. Here are five fashion lessons to take straight from the captain’s playbook.by TOI Lifestyle Desk 2/7Master the imnimalist athleisureAthleisure might feel like old news, but Gill’s approach keeps it fresh. He gravitates towards clean joggers, crisp crew-neck tees, fitted track jackets, and statement sneakers but with a muted palette. No screaming neons, no over-the-top graphics - just carefully chosen, well-fitted pieces. Think Rahul Khanna’s subtle elegance meets KL Rahul’s sporty edge.The takeaway: Your gym wear can double as your casualwear if you keep it neutral, fitted, and polished.3/7Invest in statement jacketsWhether it’s a bomber in deep forest green, a varsity jacket with bold lettering, or a tailored overcoat for winter tours abroad, Shubman treats jackets like sartorial punctuation marks. They finish his outfit with personality, much like Ranbir Kapoor’s off-duty looks or even David Beckham’s classic layering game.The takeaway: A good jacket doesn’t just keep you warm, it can carry an entire look.4/7Keep denim simple but sharpGill avoids the trap of over-distressed or overly baggy jeans. His go-to? Mid- to dark-wash denims with a straight or slim fit, paired with either a tucked-in shirt for a slightly retro vibe or a hoodie for casual comfort. The fit is never sloppy, more Shahid Kapoor’s tailored casuals than anything grungy.The takeaway: A well-fitted pair of jeans can last you seasons, both in durability and relevance.5/7Embrace monochrome momentsFrom head-to-toe black at the airport to all-white for summer outings, Shubman understands the power of a single-colour statement. It’s sleek, elongating, and always photogenic. In fact, one could argue it’s his version of a “uniform,” much like how Anand Ahuja built his signature sneaker-with-suit look.The takeaway: Don’t fear monochrome, it’s not boring if you mix textures and tones.6/7​Accessorise with restraintWhile some sports stars pile on chains, caps, and oversized shades, Gill opts for a more balanced approach. A single luxury watch, a subtle cap, or a pair of aviators, never all at once. His accessories are functional yet aspirational, much like the way Hrithik Roshan styles his off-duty looks.The takeaway: Let accessories enhance, not overwhelm, your outfit.7/7​Bonus lesson - grooming mattersIt’s impossible to talk about Shubman Gill’s style without mentioning his grooming. The always-on-point fade, the occasional stubble, and skin that somehow always looks camera-ready, it’s the cricketing equivalent of a red-carpet prep. Like David Warner said about cricket, “Preparation is everything,” and in Gill’s case, that includes his hair and skin game.Shubman Gill is proof that you don’t have to be in Bollywood to have a blockbuster wardrobe. His style is approachable yet aspirational, a mix of pieces you can find on the high street and the occasional big-ticket splurge. He isn’t trying too hard, but he’s paying attention and in fashion, much like cricket, that’s how you win the match.Whether you are a cricket fan or just looking for some wardrobe cues, consider Gill your new style captain. And remember: sometimes the most stylish move is knowing when to play it safe and when to take a risk, on the field and in your closet.Follow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousSharvari Wagh brings charm to every pink detailindia10 animals that can survive intense radiationindia10 Indian states with maximum number of National ParkstravelHow to make natural hair colour using tea and coffeeindiaDivyanka Tripathi’s top 10 stylish must-have looksindia​How to make dhaba-style Egg Curry at home​Food9 heart-healthy foods that cut attack and stroke riskindiaSaniya Iyappan steals the spotlight with her graceindiaCarrie Coon’s secret weapon on TV?

Beyond its taste, arbi is packed with fiber, potassium, and antioxidants, promoting digestive and heart health while boosting immunity. Enjoy it boiled, roasted, or in curries for sustained energy and strong bones. Remember to cook it well to eliminate calcium oxalate crystals.  If you’ve ever come across the word arbi and wondered what it means, you’re not alone. Arbi, known in English as taro root, is a starchy, underground vegetable enjoyed across Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. Though it looks like a small, brown, fuzzy potato on the outside, it holds a creamy texture and nutty flavour inside that makes it incredibly versatile in the kitchen. Beyond taste, arbi offers numerous health benefits, making it a smart addition to your diet. Whether boiled, roasted, or added to curries, this humble root has far more to offer than meets the eye.What is arbi (Taro root)Arbi or taro root is a starchy tuber that grows underground and has been enjoyed by cultures worldwide for centuries. Its pale, creamy flesh and nutty flavour make it a versatile ingredient that can be boiled, fried, mashed, or added to stews. But what makes arbi special isn’t just the taste, it’s the range of health benefits packed inside this root.Why you should add arbi to your plate: Health benefits that matter1. Aids digestive health: One of the main benefits of arbi is its high fibre content, which helps maintain healthy digestion. Fibre adds bulk to stools, promoting regular bowel movements and preventing constipation. A well-functioning digestive system also supports better nutrient absorption and reduces the risk of digestive disorders.2. Supports heart health: Arbi is a good source of potassium, a mineral essential for maintaining healthy blood pressure levels. Potassium helps balance the effects of sodium and eases tension in blood vessel walls, reducing the risk of hypertension and heart disease. Eating potassium-rich foods like arbi can be an effective part of heart-friendly dietary habits.3. Boost your immunity: Thanks to antioxidants found in arbi, your body gets an extra shield against harmful free radicals. This support means your immune system can work more effectively to keep common illnesses at bay.4. Steady energy for your busy day: Unlike sugary snacks that give you a quick rush and then a crash, arbi provides slow-releasing energy. This means you’ll feel energised for longer, perfect for powering through work, study, or workouts.5. Strong bones and muscles: Arbi also contains minerals like magnesium and calcium that are essential for bone strength and muscle function. Eating arbi regularly may support your mobility and overall body strength as you age.6. Fighting inflammation naturally: Chronic inflammation is linked to many health problems, but nature offers help in arbi. Some compounds in taro root have anti-inflammatory properties, which might help reduce discomfort and protect your body long-term.How to enjoy arbiThe great thing about arbi is that it’s incredibly versatile. Here are some ways you can enjoy it:Boiled or steamed: Simply cook until tender and season with salt and herbs for a comforting side dish.Taro chips: Slice thinly and fry or bake for a crunchy snack that rivals regular potato chips.Curries and stews: Add chunks of arbi to your favourite curries or soups to soak up all the spices and flavours.Mashed arbi: Like mashed potatoes, but with a nuttier taste- try mixing with butter and garlic for a creamy delight.Soups: Add it to broths for a hearty texture and subtle sweetness.Important tips: What you need to know before eating arbiRaw arbi contains tiny needle-like crystals called calcium oxalate, which can irritate your mouth or throat. That’s why always cook it well before eating. Boiling, steaming, or frying will break down these crystals and make it safe and delicious.If you have a history of kidney stones, it’s best to eat arbi in moderation because of its oxalate content.Also read | Is eating avocados daily safe?

Kidney cleansing and detoxing myths: What you should know
Kidney detoxes are popular, but the kidneys naturally filter blood and remove waste. Detox teas and juices lack scientific support and may harm kidney function. While hydration is important, excessive water intake can strain kidneys. A balanced diet, regular exercise, and managing underlying conditions are proven ways to support kidney health.

Detox teas and juices lack scientific support and may harm kidney function. While hydration is important, excessive water intake can strain kidneys. A balanced diet, regular exercise, and managing underlying conditions are proven ways to support kidney health.  Kidney detoxes and cleansing routines have become increasingly popular, often promoted as quick solutions to improve kidney health, remove toxins, or boost overall wellness. From herbal teas to juice fasts, many of these methods promise results that sound too good to be true. The truth is that your kidneys are already excellent at detoxifying your body without any special interventions. Misunderstanding how the kidneys work can lead to unnecessary or even harmful health practices. Falling for these myths may not only waste your time and money but also put your kidney health at risk.What kidney detox myths get wrong about your healthMyth 1: Your kidneys need regular cleansingOne of the most widespread health myths is the idea that your kidneys need to be cleansed or flushed with specific drinks or diets. In reality, healthy kidneys continuously filter your blood, remove waste products, and balance your body's fluids and electrolytes. They do this naturally and efficiently. Unless your kidneys are damaged or diseased, they do not require any external cleansing. The best way to support them is through good nutrition, proper hydration, and regular health checks.Myth 2: Detox teas and juices can repair or improve kidney functionDetox teas, juices, and supplements often claim to remove toxins or enhance kidney function, but these claims are not supported by scientific evidence. Many of these products are unregulated and may contain high levels of certain herbs or diuretics that can stress the kidneys rather than help them. In some cases, they may lead to dehydration or mineral imbalances. If you have any kidney condition, these types of detoxes may do more harm than good.Myth 3: Drinking more water always helps cleanse the kidneysWhile staying hydrated is important for kidney function, more water is not always better. Drinking too much water can dilute essential salts in the body and place strain on the kidneys. People with healthy kidneys should aim to drink according to their body's needs, which can vary based on activity level, environment, and individual health conditions. For most people, drinking when thirsty and monitoring the colour of urine is enough to stay well hydrated.Myth 4: A kidney cleanse helps remove kidney stonesSome believe that consuming large amounts of citrus juice or herbal drinks can flush out kidney stones or prevent their formation. While drinking water and maintaining a balanced diet can help prevent stones in some cases, a true kidney cleanse will not dissolve or remove existing stones. Treatment for kidney stones depends on their size and type and often requires medical supervision. Relying on home remedies could delay proper care and increase the risk of complications.What really supports your kidney healthThe kidneys thrive when you take care of your overall health. The following lifestyle choices are proven to support kidney function:Eat a balanced diet that is low in sodium and processed foodsLimit your intake of red meat and animal fatsStay physically active and maintain a healthy weightAvoid smoking and limit alcohol consumptionManage underlying conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetesStay hydrated without overdoing itAvoid overuse of painkillers and unnecessary supplementsThese habits can help protect your kidneys from damage and reduce your risk of developing chronic kidney disease.Also read | Urine colour and kidney problems: Signs you shouldn’t ignoreAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Overconsumption may lead to digestive issues and weight gain due to their high calorie and fiber content. Avocados can also interfere with blood-thinning medications because of their vitamin K levels and potentially trigger migraines in susceptible individuals.  Avocados are a popular superfood known for their creamy texture and rich nutrient profile, including healthy fats, fibre, and vitamins. However, despite their benefits, avocados can cause side effects in some people. Allergic reactions, particularly among those with latex allergies, are common. Overconsumption may lead to digestive issues like bloating and gas, especially in individuals with sensitive stomachs or IBS. Due to their high calorie content, excessive intake can contribute to weight gain. Avocados also contain vitamin K, which may interfere with blood-thinning medications. Additionally, they can trigger migraines in susceptible individuals. Eating avocados in moderation and consulting a healthcare provider is advisable.Risks and side effects of eating avocados daily1.

Blood tests can check B12 levels. Treatment includes supplements or injections. Early action is key to prevent lasting harm.  Vitamin B12 plays a vital role in maintaining the health of the nervous system, including the brain, nerves, and spinal cord. A deficiency in this essential nutrient can lead to a range of neurological symptoms, such as tingling, numbness, poor coordination, memory loss, and mood changes. If left untreated, prolonged vitamin B12 deficiency may result in irreversible nerve damage. This is particularly concerning as neurological symptoms can appear before signs of anaemia. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent long-term complications. Regular monitoring and a balanced diet or supplementation can help maintain healthy B12 levels and protect nerve health.What is Vitamin B12: Signs of deficiency that affects nerve healthVitamin B12 (also known as cobalamin) helps produce red blood cells, supports DNA synthesis, and plays a key role in maintaining healthy nerve cells. It’s naturally found in animal-based foods such as meat, fish, eggs, and dairy. People following plant-based diets, or those with medical conditions affecting absorption, are most at risk of developing a deficiency.Vitamin B12 rich foods for vegetarian dietVitamin B12 deficiency can lead to neurological symptoms even before blood levels drop enough to cause anaemia. Common nerve-related signs include:Tingling or numbness in the hands, feet, or legsBalance issues or frequent fallsWeakness in musclesMemory loss or difficulty concentratingMood changes, including depression or irritabilityBurning sensations in extremitiesCoordination problems while walkingThese symptoms may begin subtly but can worsen over time, especially if not addressed early.How low Vitamin B12 causes nerve damageVitamin B12 is vital for the production of myelin – the protective coating around nerves. When B12 is deficient, myelin begins to break down, exposing nerves to damage. This can disrupt communication between the brain and the rest of the body, resulting in symptoms like numbness, weakness, and cognitive issues.In severe cases, B12 deficiency can lead to subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, a serious neurological condition that may cause:Stiffness in the limbsPoor coordinationDifficulty walkingLoss of vibration or position senseIf untreated, some of this nerve damage may become permanent.Who is at risk of Vitamin B12 deficiencyVitamin B12 deficiency can affect anyone, but some groups are more vulnerable:Older adults (reduced absorption with age)Vegans and vegetarians (plant foods lack natural B12)People with gastrointestinal conditions, such as Crohn’s disease or coeliac diseaseThose taking certain medications, like metformin or proton pump inhibitorsPatients who have had bariatric or stomach surgeryTreatment options for VitaminB12 deficiency typically includes:Vitamin B12 injections for severe deficiency or poor absorptionOral B12 supplements for mild casesDietary changes to include B12-rich or fortified foodsImprovements may take weeks or months depending on how long the deficiency has been present.When to see a doctorIf you experience symptoms like persistent numbness, tingling, balance issues, or mental fog, speak to your GP. A simple blood test can check your B12 levels. Your doctor may also test homocysteine or methylmalonic acid (MMA) if results are borderline.Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent long-term nerve damage.Frequently Asked QuestionsQ1. Can nerve damage from low B12 be reversed?Yes, but only if caught early. Many symptoms, including fatigue, tingling, and memory issues, often improve with treatment. However, long-term deficiency can lead to irreversible nerve damage, especially in older adults.Q2. Is nerve damage from low vitamin B12 permanent?Nerve damage may be reversible if treated early, but long-term deficiency can cause permanent damage. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential.Also read | Why kidney infections spike during the monsoon season and how to stay safeAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

But what you eat first really shapes how your whole day feels, your energy, digestion, and even your mood. That’s where basi roti with ghee quietly shines. It’s basically leftover or slightly fermented whole wheat flatbread, which might not sound exciting, but it’s actually a smart way to cut down on food waste and save a few bucks. In places like UP and Bihar, folks often enjoy it with jaggery, a simple, comforting combo that’s part of everyday life. Add a generous smear of ghee, and it turns into a warm, satisfying breakfast that keeps you going through the busiest mornings. Practical, wholesome, and honestly pretty comforting, it’s a breakfast worth bringing back. Scroll down to discover five simple reasons why basi roti with ghee makes such a great breakfast.”    2/6Basi roti prevents wastage     Let’s be honest, throwing away food just doesn’t sit right with most of us. Basi roti is one of those things that often gets forgotten and tossed, but why waste it? Instead, turn those dry rotis into your new go-to breakfast. It’s an easy way to cut down on waste, save a bit of cash, and still enjoy a warm, comforting meal that actually fills you up. Plus, with everyone talking about being smarter with food these days, basi roti with ghee feels like a small but meaningful way to eat better and live a little kinder.     3/6Gut health gets a delicious boost    Fermented foods have been all the rage for gut health, and basi roti fits right in. That slight fermentation happening in basi roti actually promotes good bacteria in your gut, helping digestion and keeping things running smoothly. Then there’s ghee, which isn’t just tasty – it contains butyrate, a fatty acid known for soothing your digestive tract and reducing inflammation. Together, basi roti and ghee are like a gentle comfort for your gut first thing in the morning.    4/6Steady energy without the crash    If you’re sick of breakfasts that shoot your sugar up and then leave you crashing, basi roti is a total game changer. Since it’s made from whole wheat, it gives you slow, steady energy instead of that quick spike. And when you spread some ghee on top, those good fats help keep you full and focused for way longer. No more sneaking snacks by mid-morning or crashing hard. Just steady energy that stays with you, making it easier to power through your day without any sugar slump.    5/6Filling but easy on your stomach    Nobody wants to feel heavy or slow right after breakfast. Basi roti’s got plenty of fiber from the whole wheat, so it keeps you full without that annoying hunger creeping back too soon. Plus, since it’s a bit fermented, it’s easier on your stomach than fresh bread. Toss on a good spoonful of ghee, and it’s warm, comforting, and just the right amount of filling. It’s the kind of breakfast that just sits right with you and gives you steady energy to power through your morning without feeling wiped out.    6/6Quick and convenient     We all have mornings when time is not on our side. That’s where basi roti shines. Since it’s already made (just leftover from yesterday’s meal), all you need to do is warm it up, add on a generous dollop of ghee, and you’re set. No fancy prep, no complicated recipes. This simple breakfast is perfect for anyone juggling a packed schedule but refusing to sacrifice nutrition.Follow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousHow to make natural hair colour using tea and coffeeindiaDivyanka Tripathi’s top 10 stylish must-have looksindia​How to make dhaba-style Egg Curry at home​Food9 heart-healthy foods that cut attack and stroke riskindiaSaniya Iyappan steals the spotlight with her graceindiaCarrie Coon’s secret weapon on TV?

The circulatory process needs blood to return from your feet and legs to your heart through veins, which require working against gravitational forces. The calf muscles function as a crucial system in this process. These muscles function by contracting and relaxing to compress deep leg veins, which pushes blood toward an upward direction. The calf muscle pump function prevents blood from accumulating in your legs, while maintaining normal blood pressure levels. Blood clots and swelling along with heart strain, become more likely when calf muscles are weak or inactive.Enhanced calf muscle strength enables the heart to operate more efficiently while reducing blood pressure, and enhancing overall circulation patterns. Your calf muscles become ready for walking or exercise, when you strengthen them before physical activities, thus minimising the risk of injuries and delivering additional protection to your heart. Here are 3 such exercises...3/5Calf Raises (Heel Raises)Calf raises serve to develop both gastrocnemius and soleus muscles which are primary calf muscle groups.How to do them:Stand with your feet placed hip-width apart while using a wall or chair as support for balance if required.Slowly lift your heels off the floor, rising onto your tiptoes.Maintain this position for one brief moment to feel the calf muscles tightening.Slowly lower your heels back down to the ground.Repeat 15-20 times for 2-3 sets.Why it’s good:Calf raises engage the blood-pumping muscles, which enhance the venous return process. Regular muscle contractions through these exercises, help expand blood vessels and create blood pressure reduction effects. Before starting your walk, these exercises prepare your muscles which then become more powerful, at supporting your cardiovascular system.4/5Seated calf raisesThis exercise targets the soleus muscle, which plays a key role during activities like walking and standing.How to do them:Sit comfortably on a chair with your feet flat on the ground.You should maintain contact between your toes, foot balls, heels and floor, as you elevate your heels to their highest point.Maintain the raised position for one to two seconds, before slowly returning your heels to the floor.Repeat 15-20 times for 2-3 sets.Why it’s good:The exercise of seated calf raises provides a gentle yet effective way to strengthen the muscles, which efficiently pump blood throughout daily activities. The exercise enhances blood flow and minimises leg heaviness and swelling symptoms. This stretch before walking helps protect your heart function during exercise.5/5Calf stretch with wall supportThe practice of calf muscle stretching leads to better flexibility, while improving blood circulation to avoid muscle tightness and injuries.How to do it:Stand an arm’s length away from a wall.Place your hands flat against the wall for support.Take a step backward with one straight foot, while pressing the heel against the floor.Lower your front knee slightly and press against the wall, until you reach the stretch in your calf muscle.Maintain the stretch position for 15 to 20 seconds.Perform this stretch 2 to 3 times on each leg before changing sides.Why it’s good:Stretching allows blood flow to increase, and relaxes the calf muscles before exercise begins. Your ability to walk correctly along with cramp prevention, depends on flexible calf muscles. The stretching process improves blood circulation, which benefits heart health by making blood flow back to your heart more easily.Sources:Aster Hospitals – Calf Muscles and Heart HealthSurrey Physio – 5 Best Ways to Strengthen Your CalvesWebMD – Best Exercises for Strengthening Calf MusclesMoneycontrol – How Calf Muscles Can Keep Cardiovascular Disease at BayDisclaimer: This article is informational only and not a substitute for medical adviceFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousHow to make natural hair colour using tea and coffeeindiaDivyanka Tripathi’s top 10 stylish must-have looksindia​How to make dhaba-style Egg Curry at home​Food9 heart-healthy foods that cut attack and stroke riskindiaSaniya Iyappan steals the spotlight with her graceindiaCarrie Coon’s secret weapon on TV?

Your muscles will become stronger while developing better definition, when you jump. The repetitive jumping motion during skipping rope exercises, delivers mild bone-stimulating pressure, which leads to bone growth while reducing osteoporosis risk  Actor and fitness enthusiast Milind Soman, 59 seems to be ageing like fine wine. Whether it is his fit frame, or his awe inspiring fitness videos, the actor goes on to prove that growing older has nothing to do with feeling older. Recently he took to his IG handle to share a family video of himself, his wife Ankita and mom Usha Soman who are all skipping together. Along with the video he revealed that at 86, his Aai (mom) skips everyday for health and fitness. He said, “Family skipping time. Aai (Mother) is now 86, and skipping is something she does every day, apart from yoga and other movements. Long life, health and happiness to all,” Milind wrote in the caption of the post.5 benefits of skipping ropeSkipping rope, though basic, delivers various health advantages to people. Regular rope skipping practices both enhance fitness while delivering benefits to your heart together with your muscles and are also good for your mental health, when combined with other activities. Here's how...Boosts cardiovascular healthThe physical activity of jumping rope is an excellent cardiovascular exercise, which develops both heart and lung strength. Your heart beats faster during rope jumping, which leads to better blood circulation and stronger heart muscles. Research shows that consistent rope skipping practice lowers blood pressure while reducing heart disease risks, through improved lung and heart performance. Your body will function more efficiently, because skipping rope enhances your cardiovascular ability, which supports extended health and active life.Improves coordination and balanceTo jump rope successfully, you need to maintain rhythm while controlling your body movements at precise times. Your brain and muscles work together during skipping, to maintain your balance and coordination. The activity develops your total motor abilities and boosts your agility levels, as well as your reaction speed. Scientific research demonstrates that rope skipping enhances balance, coordination and athletic performance amongst children and athletes. Not only that, the improved coordination helps decrease the chances of falls and daily accidents that lead to injuries. (Research Journal of Pharmacy and Technology – Effect of skipping rope exercise on physical fitness, Elite Jumps Blog – Surprising Benefits of Jumping Rope)Strengthens muscles and bonesThe physical activity of skipping rope works all major muscle groups starting from your calves and thighs, then moves to your core and finally engages your arms. Your muscles will become stronger while developing better definition, when you jump. The repetitive jumping motion during skipping rope exercises, delivers mild bone-stimulating pressure, which leads to bone growth while reducing osteoporosis risk. The regular practice of rope skipping, enhances your leg muscle endurance and maintains bone health, which together create physical strength.Burns calories and aids weight lossThe high-intensity nature of rope skipping makes it an effective workout which burns calories swiftly. You can easily burn 10-15 calories per minute, when you skip rope based on how fast and intensely you jump. This activity works well for weight loss and maintaining proper body weight distribution. Rope skipping engages your entire body, which stimulates metabolic processes while providing daily fitness benefits through brief exercise sessions. (PMC – The effect of an 8-week rope skipping intervention on performance, Cleveland Clinic – 6 Benefits of Jumping Rope)Enhances mental health and reduces stressThe practice of skipping rope delivers dual benefits to both physical health, and mental wellness. Physical exercise boosts endorphin production which creates positive mood effects, while decreasing stress levels. The coordinated movements required for skipping create mental clarity and improved concentration ability. People use rope skipping as a stress relief method, to improve their mental state after working hours.Disclaimer: This article is informational only and not a substitute for medical adviceAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

From the wish-granting tree of Kalpavriksha to Shri Krishana’s favourite Kadamba, these unique trees have been revered for centuries. Let us take a look at them one by one2/5Banyan: Tree of lifeThe banyan tree often represents the Trimūrti, the three lords of cosmic creation, preservation, and destruction-namely, Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Shiva. It is often used for metaphorical reference in the Vedic scriptures written in ancient Sanskrit manuscripts. With its ever-spreading roots and branches, it is also symbolic of life and fertility in the Indian culture and is consequently worshipped by those who wish to have children. The revered banyan tree is never cut, and thus often grows over many acres.3/5Kadamba treeCommon Bur Flower or Kadam (Neolamarckia Cadamba) is a large, evergreen tree with beautiful & unique flowers. It is a fast-growing tree with a broad crown and is even planted sacredly near temples. In Hindu mythology, the Kadam tree is the favourite tree of Lord Krishna, who is usually depicted playing his flute under it. He also used to play with his friends under the Kadam tree in Vrindavan, using the unique globular flower of the tree. Hence, the tree is also known as Haripriya, God's favourite.4/5Bael: The medicinal plantThe bael is a slender, aromatic tree that bears a sweet, yellow-green fruit. It is a medicinal plant as well as a sacred tree. All parts of it are used for different healing purposes-the roots, leaves, and fruits-and it has proven effective in combating many different kinds of bacteria. It is known as “Sivadruma”, and the leaves are often offered to Lord Shiva, who is known to be particularly pleased by this tree. Baels have trifoliate leaves, i.e., a leaf structure of three, and this is sometimes thought to symbolize Siva’s trident or the Trimūrti, Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh.5/5Peepal: Tree of enlightenmentThis tree, also known as “Ashvatta,” is purportedly the most worshipped tree in India. Lord Krishna, the original incarnation of Lord Vishnu and the supreme lord of the universe according to the legends, identifies with the peepul in the sacred text Bhagavad Gita. He states, “Of all trees, I am the holy fig tree (Bhagavad Gita Verse 10.26).” In addition, the Hindus associate the roots of the tree with Lord Brahma (the creator of the universe), the trunk of the tree with Lord Vishnu (the protector and preserver), and the leaves of the tree with Lord Shiva (the destroyer).Follow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous10 animals that can survive intense radiationLifestyle10 Indian states with maximum number of National ParkstravelHow to make natural hair colour using tea and coffeeLifestyleDivyanka Tripathi’s top 10 stylish must-have lookstv​How to make dhaba-style Egg Curry at home​Food9 heart-healthy foods that cut attack and stroke riskLifestyleSaniya Iyappan steals the spotlight with her graceEntertainmentCarrie Coon’s secret weapon on TV?

A study shows moderate exercise declines about 12 years before diagnosis. This decline accelerates in the final two years. Doctors like Dr. Sudhir Kumar advise recognizing early stamina loss. Early detection allows for timely prevention and lifestyle changes. These interventions can prevent major cardiac events.  Heart attacks are usually framed as sudden emergencies, but research shows they commonly follow a slow, silent buildup that begins long before pain or hospital alarms. A major analysis of CARDIA participants found that moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) — things like brisk walking, cycling or swimming — often starts a steady decline about 12 years before a cardiovascular diagnosis, with the pace accelerating in the final two years. Experts including Dr. Sudhir Kumar (Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad) warn that this gradual loss of stamina is frequently misread as normal ageing; spotting it early creates a large window for prevention, screening and targeted lifestyle or medical interventions that can avert major cardiac events. Physical activity often starts falling 12 years before heart disease: StudyThe paper titled “Trajectories of Physical Activity Before and After Cardiovascular Disease Events in CARDIA Participants” analysed physical activity data collected across decades from participants first enrolled in 1985–86. Researchers used repeated activity assessments (multiple timepoints through midlife) to model long-term trajectories and compare people who later developed cardiovascular disease (CVD) with those who did not.The key quantitative findings: MVPA began to decline, on average, roughly 12 years before a first CVD event; declines steeped in the two years immediately before diagnosis; and low activity levels tended to persist after the event, widening the gap versus peers who remained CVD-free. The study used CARDIA’s longitudinal design to reveal this long preclinical window rather than a single cross-sectional snapshot. CARDIA tracked moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) — activities that raise heart rate and breathing noticeably (brisk walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, sports). In practice, MVPA estimates came from validated activity questionnaires administered repeatedly; these give a life-course view rather than a one-off reading. Because changes emerged gradually over a decade, the timing matters: a single clinic visit that notes “low activity today” can miss whether someone is on a downward trajectory. Longitudinal decline, especially an accelerating fall in MVPA is the important signal researchers flagged. Changes that raise heart disease riskA sustained drop in MVPA is not just a lifestyle statistic; it maps to several physiologic changes that raise cardiovascular risk:Cardiac deconditioning: Less habitual activity reduces cardiac stroke volume and aerobic capacity, so daily exertion becomes harder.Endothelial and vascular changes: Lack of movement promotes poorer endothelial function and favours atherogenic plaque formation.Metabolic effects: Inactivity increases the risk of weight gain, insulin resistance and adverse lipid changes — all major drivers of atherosclerosis.Inflammation and autonomic imbalance: Sedentary behaviour links to low-grade inflammation and less favourable autonomic (heart rate variability) profiles.Together, these pathways mean a progressive drop in MVPA both reflects and contributes to the biological processes that eventually cause heart attacks or strokes. For public guidance, major health bodies emphasise staying active because of these mechanistic links. MVPA declines over time reflect race and gender inequalities in heart healthCARDIA authors also examined demographic patterns. While MVPA tended to decline across all groups with age, the trajectory and baseline levels differed by sex and race. Notably, the study found that Black women recorded consistently lower activity levels across adulthood, and certain groups showed more continuous declines — patterns that can concentrate cardiovascular risk in already disadvantaged populations. These findings imply prevention must be tailored: population-level recommendations are necessary but insufficient without culturally and structurally appropriate supports. Think longitudinally, not just cross-sectionally. A single “low activity” datapoint is less informative than a trend; clinicians should ask about changes in routine and stamina over years.Use risk tools alongside functional history. Tools such as the ASCVD Risk Estimator help assess 10-year risk, but trend information about MVPA can flag patients who might benefit from earlier screening or intervention. Act early. Declining MVPA constitutes a window for action — lifestyle counselling, targeted exercise support, and if indicated, medical risk-factor treatment (BP, lipids, glycemia). The earlier the intervention, the greater the chance of preventing an event. How to evaluate a patient’s steady decline in staminaIf a patient reports a steady, unexplained fall in activity or stamina, reasonable initial steps include:Basic cardiovascular screening: blood pressure, BMI/waist measure, lipid panel, fasting glucose/HbA1c. Calculate ASCVD or other validated risk scores (for patients in the appropriate age range) to guide intensity of preventive therapy. Functional assessment: a simple timed walk or effort-tolerance discussion can be very revealing; refer for formal stress testing only if clinical suspicion of ischemia is present. Consider social drivers: ask about work, caregiving, safety, access to safe walking spaces and time pressures — these often explain activity declines and must be addressed.From prevention to recovery: Practical guidelines for safe and sustainable cardiovascular fitnessPublic health and cardiology bodies recommend at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity (or 75 minutes of vigorous activity) as a baseline goal for adults; more gives additional benefit. Practical tips to meet and sustain MVPA:Break activity into short, consistent bouts (eg. , 30 minutes, 5 days/week).Choose enjoyable activities (walking, cycling, swimming, dance) to improve adherence.Build movement into routines (active commuting, stairs, standing breaks at work).Set trajectory goals rather than single-day targets (track weekly MVPA minutes).Address barriers (childcare, unsafe neighbourhoods, pain) with tailored solutions or supervised programs. If someone does have a cardiovascular event, the evidence strongly supports early referral to structured cardiac rehabilitation (CR). CR combines monitored exercise, risk-factor management, nutrition and psychosocial support; it reduces mortality and improves functional recovery. Typical guidance: begin activity gently (short walks) in hospital recovery, progress under supervision to 30+ minutes of aerobic activity several times weekly, and incorporate supervised outpatient CR when available.How to track activity trends (tools that help detect a worrying decline)Wearables and phone apps: track MVPA minutes and weekly totals. Look for a sustained downward slope over months/years, not day-to-day noise.Simple logs: a weekly activity diary or 6-minute walk distance recorded every few months provides a low-tech trend.Clinical prompts: clinicians should routinely ask, “Compared with two years ago, do you find doing your usual activities harder?” A “yes” can prompt further evaluation.Also Read | Boost liver function with this gut-friendly no-bake date bar supporting overall wellness; gastroenterologist shares easy homemade recipeAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Meghan Markle burst into tears over Prince William's cruel bullying statement

Harry felt betrayed, believing the Palace prioritized William's reputation over protecting them from misinformation. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle/@Instagram Meghan Markle was left visibly shaken following the release of a statement by Buckingham Palace refuting allegations that Prince William bullied her and Prince Harry out of their royal duties. The couple has stated that the action came as a shock to them since it was released without Harry's consent and, in their opinion, did not depict their side of the story.The moment that sparked the debateIn the Netflix documentary Harry & Meghan, Harry recalled the moment he saw the statement and realised it had gone out without his consent. “No one had asked me for permission,” he said. When he told Meghan, she broke down. “She burst into floods of tears,” he added.The statement was issued by Buckingham Palace on behalf of both princes in January 2020, but according to Prince Harry in the Harry & Meghan documentary, he never agreed to it or even knew it was going out.The claim was intended to counter rumors that suggested William's conduct was a reason why the Duchess of Sussex had decided to step back from public life. Media speculations at the time were circulating over tensions in the palace. Harry believed that the palace was set to protect William's reputation, but failed to provide the same level of haste to defend him and Meghan from the spread of misinformation.For three years, they were never going to tell the truth to protect us," Harry said. "But within four hours, they were willing to lie to protect my brother." His words reflected the profound sense of betrayal he and Meghan felt afterwards.The episode is now routinely cited as among the pivotal moments that pushed the brothers further apart. Once close and united in their bereavement over their mother, Princess Diana, the princes have drifted apart. William continues to serve in his position in the UK, while Harry and Meghan have established a new life with their kids, Archie and Lilibet, in California.Signals of a possible rowCredit: InstagramNevertheless, there have been subtle hints that the chill in the air between the Sussexes and the remaining royal members may be dissipating. Rumors indicate a low-key encounter occurred in London amongst Harry's top PR communications adviser, Liam Maguire, his US counterpart, Meredith Maines, and King Charles's senior media aide, Tobyn Andreae. The encounter, held social style with drinks, allegedly was agenda-free. Instead, it gave a chance for honest dialogue, something that some insiders perceive as a good beginning.One insider characterized the meeting as a welcome moment of positive discussion after decades of tension. "There's a long road ahead, but a channel of communication is now open for the first time in years," the insider said. For Harry and Meghan, the recollection of being exposed and left vulnerable as a story they contest took hold is not likely to be forgotten soon.Whether or not this new avenue of communication will amount to genuine reconciliation is far from clear. The family's public and private spheres are so closely linked that rebuilding personal relationships tends to involve negotiating public opinion as well. At times like these, each word, each appearance, and each perceived silence can have enduring repercussions.The road aheadFor the time being, the controversy over the controversial comment remains a chilling reminder of the difficulties experienced by the Sussexes during their service as senior royals. It shows how disagreements in style and priorities within the royal family can have a profound emotional consequence, particularly when trust has been breached.If reconciliation is to happen, it will be more than a matter of one meeting. It will involve time, continued discussion, and a commitment from all parties to admit past resentments without allowing them to dictate the future.About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

How middle-class families can save INR 1.2 crore in 10 years, CA shares
CA Nitin Kaushik suggests that middle-class Indian families can accumulate INR 1.2 crores in 10 years through disciplined financial planning. His strategy involves early investment in SIPs and PPF for children, patient home buying with substantial down payments, and boosting retirement savings beyond EPF. Kaushik emphasizes consistent saving habits, avoiding lifestyle inflation, and tracking expenses to achieve financial goals.

His strategy involves early investment in SIPs and PPF for children, patient home buying with substantial down payments, and boosting retirement savings beyond EPF. Kaushik emphasizes consistent saving habits, avoiding lifestyle inflation, and tracking expenses to achieve financial goals.  For many middle-class Indian families, having a home of their own, enough funds to send kids to study abroad, savings of over INR 1.2 crores, and to retire with financial stability sounds like a dream. With modest incomes, rising costs of living, and unexpected expenses, saving big often feels impossible for many. But Chartered Accountant (CA) Nitin Kaushik believes otherwise.In a detailed post on X (formerly known as Twitter), CA Nitin Kaushik explained that with discipline, smart planning, and consistent investing habits, even people with average incomes can build a wealth of INR 1.2 crores in just 10 years. Here's how, as per Kaushik's post on X:1. Start financial planning earlyOne of Kaushik’s biggest tips is to set priorities from the start. For parents, this means beginning a child’s investment plan right from their birth. By investing just INR 10,000 per month — split between Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) in index funds and the Public Provident Fund (PPF) — parents can target to save upto INR 60 lakh in 15 years.The math works out through the power of compounding: Mutual funds can potentially earn about 12% annually, while PPF offers safety, tax benefits, and stable returns. Occasional top-ups boost the total even more.2. Buy a home without breaking your financesFor most Indians, owning a home is a major dream— but Kaushik advises people to be patient with it. Instead of jumping into a long-term home loan, families can initially rent while saving aggressively on the side. Aim to have at least 25% of the property price as a down payment before buying.When taking a loan, keep the tenure short (10 years instead of 20) and ensure EMIs don’t exceed 35% of your monthly income. This approach reduces interest costs, speeds up loan repayment, and leaves room for other investments.3. Start saving for your retirement nowRelying only on the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) is risky. Kaushik suggests gradually increasing contributions to the National Pension System (NPS) and running separate retirement-focused SIPs. The goal: build INR 30–35 lakh in retirement savings within 10 years. This diversified plan provides a safety net against inflation and unforeseen expenses.4. Small habits make big impactWealth is not just about how much you earn, but how consistently you save. Kaushik recommends:- Avoid lifestyle inflation (don’t let expenses grow just because your income does)- Track your spending with a simple spreadsheet- Delay going on expensive vacations until your savings goals are met- Celebrate milestones like hitting ₹5 lakh in SIP investments or prepaying loansThe 10-year outcomeBy following this plan, Kaushik says a typical family could achieve:INR 72 lakh from mutual fundsINR 28 lakh from PPF, EPF, and NPSINR 8 lakh in fixed deposits and emergency fundsINR 15 lakh in home equity (after loan adjustments)Even after accounting for liabilities such as a INR 22 lakh home loan balance, the net worth exceeds INR 1.2 crore in 10 years.Kaushik’s message is simple: Wealth is built slowly — through patience, consistent investing, and smart financial decisions — not by chasing quick profits. For middle-class families, starting early and staying disciplined can turn modest salaries into a strong financial future.About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Packed with antioxidants, healthy fats, and essential nutrients, they support heart health, boost brain function, and promote healthy digestion. Incorporating a moderate amount of hazelnuts into your daily diet can enhance overall well-being, contributing to stronger bones, glowing skin, and reduced inflammation.  Hazelnuts, also called filberts, are more than just a crunchy snack or a sweet ingredient in chocolate spreads. These nutrient-rich nuts are loaded with vitamins, minerals, healthy fats, and powerful antioxidants that make them a true superfood. From protecting your heart and boosting brain function to improving skin glow and supporting digestion, hazelnuts can benefit almost every part of your body. They are also a natural source of protein, fibre, and essential fatty acids, making them an excellent choice for those seeking a balanced and wholesome diet. Whether eaten raw, roasted, or blended into nut butter, adding a handful of hazelnuts to your daily routine can be a delicious way to improve your health and well-being.8 health benefits of hazelnuts to improve your over all health Hazelnuts are packed with antioxidantsStudies published in NIH have confirmed that hazelnuts are rich in vitamin E, manganese, and phenolic compounds, which act as powerful antioxidants. These help protect your cells from oxidative stress, slowing the ageing process and reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease.Surprisingly easy ways to protect your brain and prevent strokeSupport heart health and manage cholesterolStudies in NIH show hazelnuts promote better cholesterol balance by lowering LDL (bad) cholesterol and increasing HDL (good) cholesterol. High in monounsaturated fats and dietary fibre, this combination supports blood vessel flexibility, improves circulation, and reduces the risk of cardiovascular issues.Help regulate blood sugar levelsResearch by NIH confirms that the low glycaemic index of hazelnuts, combined with their magnesium content, supports blood sugar stability. Regular consumption can help those managing type 2 diabetes and may lower the risk of developing insulin resistance.Promote healthy digestionA small handful of hazelnuts provides enough dietary fibre to aid digestion, prevent constipation, and promote healthy gut bacteria. Good digestive health also supports nutrient absorption, ensuring your body makes the most of your meals.Boost brain health and cognitive functionHazelnuts provide essential nutrients for brain performance, including vitamin E, manganese, thiamine, and healthy fats. These nutrients protect brain cells, improve memory, and support sharper mental focus as you age.Enhance skin and hair healthVitamin E and healthy fats in hazelnuts nourish skin cells, helping maintain hydration and elasticity. They also protect against sun damage and oxidative stress. The same nutrients contribute to stronger, shinier hair.Reduce inflammation naturallyResearch by NIH shows that hazelnuts have anti-inflammatory compounds that may reduce chronic inflammation, a root cause of many serious conditions like heart disease, arthritis, and certain cancers.Strengthen bonesWith magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus, hazelnuts support bone density and strength. This makes them a valuable food for preventing osteoporosis and maintaining mobility as you age.How to Enjoy Hazelnuts SafelyHazelnuts may be a nutritional powerhouse, but like most nuts, they are calorie-dense, meaning it’s easy to overeat them without realising. To enjoy their health benefits without consuming excess calories, aim for a serving of 20–30 grams per day roughly a small handful. This amount is enough to provide essential vitamins, minerals, healthy fats, and antioxidants without significantly affecting your daily calorie balance.If you have a nut allergy, it’s best to avoid hazelnuts completely, as even small traces can trigger reactions. For everyone else, there are plenty of delicious ways to include them in your diet. You can eat them raw for maximum nutrient retention, roast them for a deeper flavour, sprinkle chopped hazelnuts over salads or yoghurt, blend them into smoothies for a creamy texture, or enjoy them as a natural hazelnut butter. Pairing hazelnuts with fresh fruit, dark chocolate, or whole grains can also create tasty, balanced snacks that keep you full for longer.From heart health and brain support to glowing skin, better digestion, and stronger bones, hazelnuts are a versatile superfood worth adding to your diet. Just remember, moderation is key. Enjoy them regularly as part of a balanced diet, and their benefits will reward you for years to come.Also read| 10 benefits of karela juice daily: Boost immunity, manage blood sugar, support digestionAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, it boosts immunity, aids digestion, and supports weight loss. Studies suggest it helps regulate blood sugar, detoxifies the liver, enhances skin health, and may possess anti-cancer properties. While beneficial, moderation is key to avoid potential side effects.   Karela juice, made from the humble bitter gourd, is one of those age-old remedies that has stood the test of time. Its sharp, bitter taste might make you wince, but behind that strong flavour lies a treasure chest of health benefits. For centuries, karela has been used in Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine to treat a variety of ailments, from digestive troubles to blood sugar imbalances. Today, modern nutrition science is catching up, recognising karela juice as a functional health drink rich in vitamins, minerals, fibre, and powerful plant compounds.When consumed regularly (in moderation), karela juice can help improve immunity, support healthy digestion, promote weight loss, and even enhance skin health. Whether you’re looking to manage blood sugar naturally or simply want a nutrient-packed drink to start your morning, karela juice can be a game-changer in your daily wellness routine. Let’s explore its top 10 health benefits.10 health benefits of drinking karela juice every dayBoosts immunity with vitamin c and zincAccording to a study in BMC, karela juice is a natural immune system ally. High in vitamin C, zinc, and flavonoids, it helps your body fight off infections more effectively. The antioxidants in karela juice neutralise free radicals, lowering inflammation and helping your body recover faster from illnesses. A regular intake can be particularly beneficial during seasonal changes when colds and flu are more common.Improves digestion and relieves bloatingBitter foods have long been valued for their ability to stimulate digestion, and karela juice is no exception. Its fibre content aids bowel regularity, while digestive enzymes in the juice encourage the breakdown of food for easier absorption. If you often experience bloating, gas, or indigestion, a small serving of karela juice before meals can help ease discomfort and improve nutrient uptake.Supports weight loss naturallyIf you’re aiming to lose weight without extreme diets, karela juice can be a supportive addition. It’s low in calories but rich in dietary fibre, which keeps you full for longer and curbs unnecessary snacking. Certain compounds in karela also help regulate blood sugar, preventing sudden spikes and crashes that often lead to sugar cravings. When paired with a balanced diet and regular exercise, it can accelerate fat loss in a healthy way.Helps regulate blood sugar levelsPerhaps the most famous benefit of karela juice is its role in blood sugar management. Studies by NIH confirmed that it contains compounds like charantin, vicine, and polypeptide-P — all of which mimic the effects of insulin, helping glucose enter cells more efficiently. This makes it a natural aid for people looking to keep their blood sugar within healthy ranges. However, if you’re on diabetes medication, consult your doctor before adding karela juice to your diet to avoid hypoglycemia.Protects cells from damage with antioxidantsOxidative stress is linked to premature ageing and chronic diseases, but karela juice’s antioxidant profile can help counter it. According to NIH’s studies, vitamins A and C, along with polyphenols, work together to protect cells from damage, maintain healthy tissues, and support overall vitality. Regular consumption may also reduce the risk of certain inflammatory conditions.Promotes liver detox and gut healthYour liver plays a key role in detoxification, and karela juice supports this vital process. It stimulates bile production, which aids fat digestion and helps the body eliminate toxins. A well-functioning liver not only supports digestion but also improves metabolism and overall energy levels.Enhances skin health and fights acneThe skin-clearing benefits of karela juice come from its detoxifying and anti-inflammatory properties. By flushing out toxins from the bloodstream, it reduces skin irritation, redness, and breakouts. It’s also rich in vitamin C, which supports collagen production, keeping skin firm and youthful. Regular drinkers often notice a brighter complexion over time.Shows potential anti-cancer propertiesEmerging research by NIH suggests that karela extract may have compounds that slow down the growth of certain cancer cells, particularly in the colon, liver, and breast. While karela juice is not a cure, its high antioxidant content and ability to support immune health may play a protective role when combined with a nutrient-rich diet.Provides antimicrobial and antiviral benefitsKarela juice contains bioactive compounds with antibacterial and antiviral effects, helping to protect against infections. Traditionally, it has been used to fight intestinal worms and improve gut microbial balance. In modern times, this property adds to its role in supporting immunity.Aids wound healing in diabeticsSome studies by NIH show that karela juice can promote wound healing, especially in people with diabetes. By improving blood circulation and reducing inflammation, it supports tissue repair and recovery. However, this should be used as a complementary remedy, not a replacement for medical treatment.Karela juice is a powerful natural remedy, but like all good things, it should be consumed in moderation. Its benefits range from strengthening immunity and aiding weight loss to improving skin health and supporting digestion. However, overconsumption may cause digestive discomfort, diarrhoea, or dangerously low blood sugar levels, especially for those on diabetic medication. Pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid it without medical advice. For safe consumption, start with 30–50 ml diluted in water a few times a week and gradually increase if needed. Its bitter flavour may take time to get used to, but when enjoyed regularly and in moderation, karela juice can be a valuable addition to a balanced, healthy lifestyle.Also read| 7 best green teas to support weight management and overall healthAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Experts recommend simple lifestyle tweaks for better rest. These include changing pillow covers weekly, avoiding evening caffeine and heavy late meals, limiting screen time, and maintaining a consistent bedtime routine. These adjustments promote relaxation, boost melatonin, and support the body's natural sleep-wake cycle.  Good sleep isn’t a luxury, it’s a vital part of maintaining physical health, emotional balance, and mental clarity. Yet, millions of people struggle with falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up refreshed. The problem isn’t always the number of hours you spend in bed, but the quality of those hours. Sleep experts highlight that small daily habits, like when you drink your coffee or how often you change your pillow cover, can have a surprisingly big impact on how well you rest. By making a few simple changes, you can improve your sleep quality, enhance your energy levels during the day, and even boost your overall immunity. Here are five expert-recommended lifestyle tweaks that can help you sleep better, starting tonight.5 habits to change for a restful night’s sleep naturallyChange your pillow cover regularly for better sleep qualityAccording to a study published in sleep foundation, clean pillow cover supports both hygiene and restful sleep. Over time, pillowcases collect dust mites, allergens, skin oils, and sweat, all of which can trigger discomfort, respiratory irritation, or even mild allergic reactions. These irritations may cause restless nights or frequent wake-ups. Washing or replacing your pillow cover at least once a week creates a fresher, healthier sleep environment, helping your body relax more easily into deep, restorative rest.Avoid evening caffeine to improve sleep qualityStudies done by sleep foundation have shown that caffeine is a stimulant that can stay in your system for up to eight hours. Even a late-afternoon coffee, tea, or energy drink can delay sleep onset and reduce deep sleep stages. For better sleep, cut off caffeine at least six hours before bedtime. Switch to herbal teas, warm milk, or simply water in the evenings to allow your nervous system to wind down naturally.Skip heavy meals before bed for better digestion and sleepEating heavy, rich, or spicy meals late at night forces your body to focus on digestion instead of relaxation. This can cause indigestion, bloating, or acid reflux, all of which disturb sleep quality. To improve both digestion and sleep, try finishing dinner at least two to three hours before bedtime. If you feel hungry later, opt for a light snack like a banana or a handful of nuts.Limit screen time to boost sleep qualityResearch by sleep foundation has confirmed that exposure to blue light from phones, TVs, and laptops suppresses melatonin production, the hormone that signals your body it’s time to sleep. By scrolling in bed or watching late-night shows, you’re telling your brain to stay alert. For better sleep, switch off all screens at least an hour before bedtime. Instead, choose activities like reading a book, meditating, or gentle stretching to help your body prepare for rest.Follow a consistent bedtime routine for long-term sleep improvementYour body’s internal clock, or circadian rhythm, thrives on consistency. Going to bed and waking up at the same time each day reinforces your natural sleep-wake cycle, making it easier to fall asleep and wake up without feeling groggy. Include calming rituals like a warm shower, soft music, or journaling in your nightly routine to signal your body that it’s time to wind down.Quick recap table for sleep improvementHabitChange to makeHow it helps sleep qualityPillow hygieneWash/replace weeklyReduces allergens and discomfortEvening caffeineAvoid after afternoonHelps you fall asleep fasterHeavy late mealsEat 2–3 hours before bedPrevents digestive discomfortScreen exposureStop 1 hour before bedBoosts melatonin productionIrregular sleep scheduleKeep consistent routineSupports circadian rhythmImproving your sleep quality doesn’t always require medical intervention or drastic lifestyle changes. By making these five adjustments, keeping your bedding fresh, skipping evening caffeine, avoiding late heavy meals, limiting screen time, and committing to a consistent bedtime routine, you give your body the right environment for deep, restorative rest. Try implementing one change at a time, and you may find yourself not only sleeping better but also feeling more energized, focused, and balanced during the day.Also read| Why you shouldn’t shower right after eating: Lifestyle coach reveals the impact on digestionAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Why you shouldn’t shower right after eating: Lifestyle coach reveals the impact on digestion
Lifestyle coach Luke Coutinho advises against showering immediately after meals, as it diverts blood flow from the digestive system, potentially hindering nutrient absorption and causing discomfort. Waiting 90-120 minutes post-meal or showering beforehand allows for optimal digestion, especially beneficial for those with gut sensitivities. This simple adjustment can improve energy levels and overall gut health.

Waiting 90-120 minutes post-meal or showering beforehand allows for optimal digestion, especially beneficial for those with gut sensitivities. This simple adjustment can improve energy levels and overall gut health.  Many of us enjoy a relaxing shower after a meal, thinking it helps us feel refreshed but this everyday habit could be secretly harming your digestion. Lifestyle coach Luke Coutinho, in a recent Instagram post, warned that showering immediately after eating can interfere with the body’s natural digestive process. When you eat, your body increases blood flow to the stomach, activates digestive enzymes, and works to regulate temperature for optimal breakdown of food. Stepping into the shower too soon diverts this focus, which can be especially troublesome for those dealing with bloating, acid reflux, IBS, or sluggish digestion. The fix is simple: shower before meals or wait 90–120 minutes afterward to give your gut the time it needs to do its job efficiently.Why showering after meals affects digestionBlood flow diversionWhen you eat, your body prioritises sending blood to the stomach and intestines to break down food and absorb nutrients. A hot shower draws blood toward the skin’s surface to help regulate temperature, reducing the supply to your digestive system. A cold shower can cause the opposite, narrowing blood vessels and restricting circulation. In both cases, the stomach gets less support, slowing digestion and potentially causing discomfort.Greater impact on sensitive gutsPeople with existing gut health problems, such as gastritis, IBS, chronic acidity, or constipation are more likely to feel the negative effects. Disrupting digestion early can trigger bloating, heaviness, or acid reflux, making recovery from gut issues more difficult.Temperature regulation interferenceDigestion slightly increases your body’s core temperature. Sudden exposure to very hot or cold water forces your system to shift focus toward temperature control instead of digestion. Over time, this repeated interference could lead to poor nutrient absorption and inflammation.How to adjust your shower habits for better digestionTo protect your digestive health, it’s worth making a few simple changes to your shower routine. Ideally, take a shower before meals, especially before heavy lunches or dinners, so your body can focus entirely on breaking down food afterward. If showering before eating isn’t possible, wait at least 90–120 minutes after a meal. This window gives your stomach and intestines time to process food, release enzymes, and absorb nutrients without interference. Even if you don’t have gut issues, limiting post-meal showers to occasional situations is wise. Making this adjustment not only supports digestion but also helps maintain steady energy levels, reduces the risk of bloating, and promotes overall gut health in the long run.Benefits of waiting before showeringBetter nutrient absorption, uninterrupted blood flow ensures your body uses vitamins and minerals effectively.Reduced post-meal fatigue, avoiding a shower right after eating can help you feel less sluggish and more alert.Improved metabolism, a smoother digestive process supports balanced energy and weight management.How to make the habit change easyPlan your schedule so you shower in the morning before breakfast or later in the day well after meals.After workouts, cool down first and wait before eating or showering to avoid overlapping stress on digestion.Use the waiting period after meals for light activity such as walking, gentle stretching, or reading, these can actually enhance digestion.Summary table: Shower timing and digestionHabitRecommended ChangeWhy It HelpsShowering immediately after mealsWait 90–120 minutesKeeps blood flow focused on digestionLong hot showers post-mealReduce temperature or delayPrevents excessive vasodilationCold showers right after eatingDelay until digestion startsAvoids blood vessel constrictionShowering before eatingMaintain as a habitPrepares the body for smooth digestionShowering after meals may seem harmless, but as Luke Coutinho points out, it can subtly slow down your digestion and reduce gut health efficiency over time. This is especially important for people with sensitive digestive systems. By making a simple change, showering before meals or waiting at least 90–120 minutes afterward, you can support better nutrient absorption, reduce digestive discomfort, and keep your energy levels steady. Sometimes, it’s these small, mindful adjustments that deliver the biggest long-term health benefits.Also read| Childhood obesity linked to colon cancer risk: Why parents should take early weight gain seriouslyAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

These bars are a healthy alternative to store-bought sweets. They are rich in fibre, healthy fats, and antioxidants. The key ingredients include Medjool dates, nut butter, almonds, pistachios, and dark chocolate. The recipe involves layering these ingredients and chilling. These bars support digestive health, liver function, and sustained energy.  Craving something sweet but don’t want to derail your healthy eating plan? No-bake date bars are the perfect solution — a naturally sweet, nutrient-rich snack that’s quick to prepare and loaded with health benefits. Recently, gastroenterologist Dr Joseph Salhab shared his recipe for this wholesome dessert on Instagram, highlighting how it can be both gut-friendly and liver-supportive.By combining dates, almonds, pistachios, and dark chocolate, this recipe delivers a satisfying treat that’s high in fibre, healthy fats, and antioxidants, without the need for refined sugar or baking.Signs that all is not well with your liverWhy no-bake date bars are a healthier dessert choice; gastroenterologists explainsMost store-bought sweets are loaded with processed sugar, preservatives, and unhealthy fats. Date-based bars, on the other hand, offer a more natural alternative.Dates provide prebiotic fibre, which feeds the beneficial bacteria in your gut, helping maintain digestive health.Nuts such as almonds and pistachios supply healthy fats, protein, and essential micronutrients like vitamin E, magnesium, and zinc.Dark chocolate (70% cocoa or higher) is rich in flavonoids, powerful antioxidants that may improve heart and liver function.Dr Salhab points out that this combination not only satisfies cravings but also supports overall wellness, making these bars suitable as a snack or dessert.No-bake-date bars: Key ingredients and their nutritional benefitsMedjool dates Medjool dates are naturally sweet, eliminating the need for added sugar. They are a rich source of fibre, potassium, magnesium, and antioxidants that help regulate digestion, support energy production, and protect against oxidative stress.Nut butter Nut butters like almond or peanut butter add a creamy texture and are packed with monounsaturated fats that promote heart health. They also provide protein for satiety and muscle repair.Almonds and Pistachios Both almonds and pistachios are excellent sources of healthy fats, plant protein, vitamin E, and minerals. These nutrients support liver detoxification and help keep cholesterol levels balanced.Dark Chocolate Choosing 70% cocoa or higher ensures your chocolate is rich in flavonoids, which can help reduce inflammation, improve blood flow, and protect liver cells from damage.No-bake date bars recipe at home: Step-by-step processStep 1 – Prepare the baseRemove the pits from approximately 14 Medjool dates. Line a baking tin with parchment paper and press the dates into an even, flat layer to form the base.Step 2 – Add the creamy layerSpread ¼ cup of your favourite nut butter evenly over the date base.
