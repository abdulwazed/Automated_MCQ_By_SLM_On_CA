This move streamlines entry, supports Kuwait’s Vision 2035 economic diversification, and boosts tourism projected to exceed $1.13 billion by 2025. It aligns Kuwait with regional efforts to enhance mobility, cultural exchange, and sustainable growth. GCC expats can now get a Kuwait tourist visa on arrival at all airports and border ports with valid passport and 6-month residency/ File In a major policy shift benefiting millions of Gulf expatriates, Kuwait now allows foreign GCC residents to obtain tourist visas on arrival, without prior application or embassy procedures, lifting long-standing restrictions and opening new travel opportunities across the region.What the new policy entails Kuwait's First Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister, Sheikh Fahad Al-Yousef Al-Sabah, issued the new directive through the country’s official gazette Kuwait Alyoum on Sunday, August 10, 2025. The announcement confirms that any foreign national residing in a Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) country, that is, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, or Kuwait itself, is now eligible to receive a tourist visa on arrival, as long as their residency permit is valid for at least six months. The visa is granted directly at the port of entry into Kuwait and does not restrict eligibility based on nationality, provided the residency criteria are met. This policy immediately repeals a 2008 regulation that previously governed how foreign residents of GCC states could enter Kuwait for tourism purposes. The aim is to streamline entry procedures and improve regional mobility, particularly for non-GCC nationals residing in the region.Eligibility and entry processThe visa-on-arrival process has been designed to be simple and efficient. Upon arrival at any Kuwaiti border point or airport, eligible travelers can approach designated immigration counters. Immigration officers will check:  Validity of the GCC residency permit (minimum six months)   Valid passport and travel documentation   Once these are verified, the tourist visa is issued on the spot. This facilitates quick entry into Kuwait, without the need for prior online applications or embassy visits. The move is particularly beneficial for expats who often travel on short notice for leisure, family visits, or non-work purposes. Who benefits and why it mattersThe decision significantly impacts a large portion of the Gulf’s population. As of the end of 2024, the GCC region had a total population of over 61.2 million, and foreign residents made up more than half of that figure. Historically, while GCC citizens enjoy seamless inter-country travel, foreign expatriates have faced more restrictive entry rules, including in Kuwait. This change reflects a broader regional trend toward easing travel restrictions for expatriate residents, especially in support of intra-Gulf tourism. Countries like the UAE and Oman have already taken similar steps to liberalize visa norms for residents of neighboring Gulf states. The policy could also simplify movement for expats living in geographically close cities like Riyadh, Dammam, Manama, and Doha, making weekend travel or short leisure trips to Kuwait a practical option.Tourism and economic integrationThe visa-on-arrival policy goes beyond convenience, supporting Kuwait’s broader goal to boost tourism, a sector projected to generate over $1.13 billion by 2025. This aligns with Kuwait’s Vision 2035, aiming for economic diversification and cultural growth beyond oil. By easing travel for GCC residents, Kuwait strengthens regional ties and follows Gulf neighbors in promoting sustainable tourism, enhancing its cultural appeal, and driving economic integration across the region.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
