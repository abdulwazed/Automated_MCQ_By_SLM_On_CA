These adjustments promote relaxation, boost melatonin, and support the body's natural sleep-wake cycle.  Good sleep isn’t a luxury, it’s a vital part of maintaining physical health, emotional balance, and mental clarity. Yet, millions of people struggle with falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up refreshed. The problem isn’t always the number of hours you spend in bed, but the quality of those hours. Sleep experts highlight that small daily habits, like when you drink your coffee or how often you change your pillow cover, can have a surprisingly big impact on how well you rest. By making a few simple changes, you can improve your sleep quality, enhance your energy levels during the day, and even boost your overall immunity. Here are five expert-recommended lifestyle tweaks that can help you sleep better, starting tonight.5 habits to change for a restful night’s sleep naturallyChange your pillow cover regularly for better sleep qualityAccording to a study published in sleep foundation, clean pillow cover supports both hygiene and restful sleep. Over time, pillowcases collect dust mites, allergens, skin oils, and sweat, all of which can trigger discomfort, respiratory irritation, or even mild allergic reactions. These irritations may cause restless nights or frequent wake-ups. Washing or replacing your pillow cover at least once a week creates a fresher, healthier sleep environment, helping your body relax more easily into deep, restorative rest.Avoid evening caffeine to improve sleep qualityStudies done by sleep foundation have shown that caffeine is a stimulant that can stay in your system for up to eight hours. Even a late-afternoon coffee, tea, or energy drink can delay sleep onset and reduce deep sleep stages. For better sleep, cut off caffeine at least six hours before bedtime. Switch to herbal teas, warm milk, or simply water in the evenings to allow your nervous system to wind down naturally.Skip heavy meals before bed for better digestion and sleepEating heavy, rich, or spicy meals late at night forces your body to focus on digestion instead of relaxation. This can cause indigestion, bloating, or acid reflux, all of which disturb sleep quality. To improve both digestion and sleep, try finishing dinner at least two to three hours before bedtime. If you feel hungry later, opt for a light snack like a banana or a handful of nuts.Limit screen time to boost sleep qualityResearch by sleep foundation has confirmed that exposure to blue light from phones, TVs, and laptops suppresses melatonin production, the hormone that signals your body it’s time to sleep. By scrolling in bed or watching late-night shows, you’re telling your brain to stay alert. For better sleep, switch off all screens at least an hour before bedtime. Instead, choose activities like reading a book, meditating, or gentle stretching to help your body prepare for rest.Follow a consistent bedtime routine for long-term sleep improvementYour body’s internal clock, or circadian rhythm, thrives on consistency. Going to bed and waking up at the same time each day reinforces your natural sleep-wake cycle, making it easier to fall asleep and wake up without feeling groggy. Include calming rituals like a warm shower, soft music, or journaling in your nightly routine to signal your body that it’s time to wind down.Quick recap table for sleep improvementHabitChange to makeHow it helps sleep qualityPillow hygieneWash/replace weeklyReduces allergens and discomfortEvening caffeineAvoid after afternoonHelps you fall asleep fasterHeavy late mealsEat 2–3 hours before bedPrevents digestive discomfortScreen exposureStop 1 hour before bedBoosts melatonin productionIrregular sleep scheduleKeep consistent routineSupports circadian rhythmImproving your sleep quality doesn’t always require medical intervention or drastic lifestyle changes. By making these five adjustments, keeping your bedding fresh, skipping evening caffeine, avoiding late heavy meals, limiting screen time, and committing to a consistent bedtime routine, you give your body the right environment for deep, restorative rest. Try implementing one change at a time, and you may find yourself not only sleeping better but also feeling more energized, focused, and balanced during the day.Also read| Why you shouldn’t shower right after eating: Lifestyle coach reveals the impact on digestionAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.
