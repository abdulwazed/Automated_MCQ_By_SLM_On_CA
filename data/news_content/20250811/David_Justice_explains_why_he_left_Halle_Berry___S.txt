Halle Berry Image Credit: Vinnie Zuffante/Getty Former MLB star David Justice has spoken in detail about his brief marriage to Halle Berry, nearly three decades after their split. In an Aug. 7, 2025 interview on the “All the Smoke” podcast, Justice said his own expectations of a “traditional” wife shaped how he viewed the relationship in the mid-1990s. He added that if the couple had known more about counseling, they “probably could have made it.”Justice married Berry in 1993 and the pair separated in 1996. The divorce was finalized in 1997. He told hosts Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson that he was young, had limited relationship experience, and assumed a wife should cook, clean, and show strong maternal instincts. He said he did not see those traits in Berry at the time and began to question whether they should start a family. “She don’t cook, don’t clean, don’t really seem like motherly,” he recalled thinking back then.The former All-Star also said their work schedules kept them apart for long stretches while Berry filmed projects in different countries. Looking back, he believes therapy could have helped them handle time apart and mismatched expectations. “If we knew about therapy, we probably could have made it,” he said.The comments landed quickly online. Entertainment outlets highlighted the remarks, and the “cook and clean” line drew a sharp response. Several posts criticized the comment as outdated, while others noted that couples evolve and that Justice admitted his views at the time were narrow and shaped by youth. Coverage from Yahoo Entertainment reiterated that Justice framed his comments as reflection, not as a new attack on his ex.Justice also touched on a long-running rumor that he was the unnamed ex accused of abusing Berry. He has denied that for years, and in 2015 he thanked Berry on Twitter for “quashing the rumors,” though she did not name him directly. The podcast segment focused largely on his own growth and on how little he understood about relationships in his twenties.Several outlets amplified one additional claim from the conversation. Justice said Berry proposed after about five months of dating and that he agreed even though he was unsure if his heart was fully in it. He suggested the decision was rushed and that youth and inexperience played a part. While that detail drew fresh headlines, the larger theme of the interview was regret over not seeking help sooner and not understanding how to balance two demanding careers.Neither Berry nor her representatives have responded to the new comments. She has spoken in the past about refusing to stay in relationships that do not feel right and about making choices that protect her well-being. For now, Justice’s interview has reopened debate about what couples owe each other, how gender roles have shifted, and how therapy can change outcomes when both partners are willing.Key timelineMarried in 1993, separated in 1996, divorce finalized in 1997.Justice says distance, clashing expectations and lack of counseling were major factors.The “cook and clean” quote sparked online backlash and fresh media coverage.Justice’s remarks land in a culture that talks more openly about therapy than it did in the mid-90s. The reaction shows how quickly public opinion pushes back on old ideas about what a marriage should look like. Whether the conversation fades or not, the interview offers a clear takeaway from Justice himself. He says maturity and counseling might have changed the story. He also accepts that he did not have either when it mattered.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
