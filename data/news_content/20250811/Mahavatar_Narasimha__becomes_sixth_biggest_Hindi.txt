Ashwin Kumar's Mahavatar Narasimha has pulled off yet another box office milestone. With its total Hindi collections now standing at Rs 126.15 crore, the animation mythological drama has officially climbed to the sixth spot among the highest-grossing Hindi films of 2025. In doing so, it has overtaken Akshay Kumar’s Sky Force (Rs 113.62 crore) and Salman Khan’s Sikandar (Rs 110.36 crore).The film’s box office trajectory has been nothing short of remarkable in the Hindi belt. Opening modestly at Rs 1.35 crore on Day 1, the film picked up steam over the first weekend with Rs 3.25 crore on Day 2 and Rs 6.8 crore on Day 3. The strong word-of-mouth, coupled with glowing reviews for its performances and action sequences, helped it hold steady through the weekdays and ended week 1 with Rs 32.45 crore in Hindi. The momentum didn’t slow in the second week as well where it added another Rs 54.95 crore to its kitty. What really sealed its place among the year’s top earners was its third weekend. Day 16 brought in Rs 16 crore, Day 17 stood at Rs 17.5 crore as per early trends, thus taking the overall collection of the film to Rs 126.15 for its Hindi version,meaning the third Sunday’s haul was strong enough to propel the film past both Sky Force and Sikandar. The film has been released in multiple languages and its overall collection across languages stands at Rs 168.75 crore. With this latest milestone, Mahavatar Narasimha now sits behind only five other Hindi releases of the year like Chhava, Saiyaara, Sitaara Zameen Par , Housefull 5 and Raid 2. The film still has three more days before the biggest clash of Indian Cinema takes place on 14th August as Rajinikanth and Lokesh Kanagaraj’s Coolie clashes with Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR’s War 2. It would be a case study as to how this now animation giant holds out against these big names and how much box office collection it can make.
