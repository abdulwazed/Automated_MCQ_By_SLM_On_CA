Suniel Shetty has had an enduring Bollywood career spanning over thirty years and is also popularly known as Anna. Keeping his brand as one of the leading action stars of the 1990s and 2000s, he has transformed from a film star into a multi-faceted person. In addition to acting, he is an entrepreneur, philanthropist, and fitness aficionado, and he continues to tap into everything he pursues. His zeal and character for performing, as well as his disciplined body, have all gained him a fan base that spans generations.Suniel Shetty and his strong careerSuniel is still going strong, from delivering impactful dialogues to making calculated career decisions. As recently as 2025, his estimated net worth was at about ₹125 crore (almost $15 million). His income stream is as varied as his career has been, including films, endorsements, hospitality, real estate, and fitness. As an actor for more than 30 years in over 150 films, he has earned an estimated ₹300 crore in acting alone, which will be enhanced by his other business interests.Suniel Shetty Gets Slammed for His Views | Daughter Athiya Drops a Brutal Reality CheckA pioneer in the hospitality business in Bollywood, Suniel launched H2O (a popular restaurant and bar in Bandra, Mumbai), which grew extremely popular in a very short span of time after it was opened, due in part to the number of celebrities that frequented his restaurant. After its successful run, Suniel scaled down H2O and turned it into the restaurant Little Italy, which offered good, authentic Italian food for both high-end clients and the general public.PollDo you think Suniel Shetty's transition from actor to entrepreneur is inspiring?Yes, absolutely!No, not really.In terms of acting, Suniel most recently appeared in the show 'Hunter 2' on Amazon MX Player, playing the character of ACP Vikram Sinha, a man trying to find and rescue his kidnapped daughter from a psychopath known as The Salesman, played by Jackie Shroff. Throughout the series there is insight into Vikram's past, and a balance of high-octane action and emotional reference is present.Looking ahead, Suniel is part of Welcome to the Jungle, the third film in the Welcome franchise, alongside Akshay Kumar, Paresh Rawal, and an ensemble cast. He will also reprise his beloved role in 'Hera Pheri 3', with filming now back on track after delays.Some of Suniel Shetty’s most iconic dialogues:“Main tumhe bhool jaon yeh ho nahi sakta … aur tum mujhe bhool jao, yeh main hone nahi doonga.” (Dhadkan)“Dilwale toh bahut dekhe, lekin pyar mein joh pagal ho jaye … aise dilwale ko aaj pehli baar dekha.” (Dilwale)“Mohabbat aur paagalpan ka bohot purana rishta hai.” (Border)“Ek sachche desh bhakt ko hum fauj se nikaal sakte hain, lekin uske dil se desh bhakti nahi.” (Jai Ho)“Tumhare haathon mein woh rekhayein hai, jo mere haathon mein nahi hai … Tumhare maathe pe woh lakeerein hai, jo mere maathe par nahi hai.” (Dhadkan)We see Suniel Shetty moving from the cinema to the corporate world, signifying the fact that true stars rise to the occasion when faced with challenges and turn out to be more adaptable than you think.
