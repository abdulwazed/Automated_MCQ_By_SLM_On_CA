Rajinikanth's 'Coolie,' directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj, is poised to break records in North America, nearing $1.86 million in premiere sales, challenging 'Kabali's' record. The film, featuring a pan-Indian cast including Nagarjuna and Aamir Khan, faces 'War 2' at the box office but boasts strong advance sales. 'Coolie' is anticipated to be a major cultural event for Tamil cinema. The Rajinikanth0Lokesh Kanagaraj juggernaut Coolie is on the verge of creating history in North America. With three days still to go before its August 14 premiere, the film has already raked in a staggering USD 1.60 million for it’s premiere shows in USA alone and after adding Canada numbers the collection jumps to USD 1.86 million. This put Coolie well within touching distance of the all-time Tamil record set by Kabali in 2016 with $1.92 million.Trade analysts say the pace of ticket sales points to Coolie not just breaking Kabali’s record but doing so with room to spare, potentially setting a new benchmark for Tamil cinema in the region. The massive surge in bookings over the past week signals the power of the Rajinikanth and Lokesh Kanagaraj pairing, which has sent fan anticipation through the roof. The director, known for his high-octane, stylized action narratives, appears to have delivered yet another mass entertainer that has struck a chord well before release.The star-studded ensemble has only amplified the hype. Joining Rajinikanth are Telugu superstar Nagarjuna, Malayalam favorite Shoubin Shahir, Kannada legend Upendra, veteran actor Sathyaraj, and Shruti Haasan, with Bollywood icon Aamir Khan making a special cameo appearance. The sheer range of pan-Indian talent has helped Coolie transcend regional boundaries, fueling advance sales across diverse South Asian diaspora pockets in North America.Adding to the excitement is the fact that Coolie is headed for one of the year’s biggest box office clashes. The film will release alongside War 2, led by Hrithik Roshan, Jr NTR, and Kiara Advani, and directed by Ayan Mukerji. While War 2 has made a solid start in the USA with USD 435K in North America , Coolie currently holds a commanding lead.The stark gap between the two films’ advance sales reflects not just Coolie’s overwhelming star power but also the fierce loyalty of Rajinikanth’s overseas fanbase. His last outings in Jailer had l performed exceptionally in the circuit , but the current momentum suggests Coolie could be his biggest opener in the market yet.With just days to go, Coolie is more than a film release—it’s shaping up to be a cultural event for Tamil cinema overseas. Whether it’s the record-breaking premiere, the mega cast, or the Lokesh Kanagaraj brand of spectacle, all signs point to August 14 delivering fireworks at the North American box office.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
