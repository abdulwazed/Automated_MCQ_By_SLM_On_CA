Taking place at Salalah Gardens Mall during the enchanting Khareef (monsoon) season, the event provides a dynamic platform where tradition, entrepreneurship, and friendship come together. Organised by the Omani-Bahraini Friendship Association in collaboration with the Embassy of the Kingdom of Bahrain to Oman and the Oman Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s Dhofar branch, the exhibition features 53 participants from both countries, including small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and productive families. The diverse range of products on display includes handicrafts, pottery, traditional attire, and other items that beautifully reflect the rich cultural heritage and environmental identity of the two brotherly nations. Beyond its economic goals, the exhibition is a celebration of shared heritage and a cultural exchange, enhancing the Khareef season’s appeal for both local residents and tourists. Visitors have the opportunity to explore craftsmanship passed down through generations, fostering deeper appreciation and understanding between the peoples of Oman and Bahrain. Radina Al Hajri, Chairwoman of the Omani-Bahraini Friendship Association, emphasized the event’s dual role in strengthening fraternal ties and providing a valuable platform for SMEs to showcase and market their products. “This exhibition is more than a marketplace, it’s a celebration of our history, culture, and collaborative spirit,” she said. The event was inaugurated under the patronage of Faisal Abdullah Al Rowas, Chairman of the Oman Chamber of Commerce and Industry, in the presence of dignitaries and officials. Building on the success of previous editions, including the fourth exhibition held in 2024 at Salalah Grand Mall, which featured 33 entrepreneurs and fostered economic collaboration during the same season, this year’s edition expands the scope and participation, further solidifying the cultural and economic bridge between the two nations. With ten days of exhibitions ahead, the event promises to be a highlight of the Khareef festivities, showcasing not only products but also the spirit of partnership and shared identity that unites Oman and Bahrain.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
