How AI may be shutting US computer science graduates out of entry-level jobs
Once-promising US computer science graduates now face shrinking entry-level job prospects as AI tools automate coding and hiring. Layoffs at major tech firms, AI-driven resume screenings, and an “AI loop” of automated applications and rejections have left many struggling to secure work. The future demands adaptability, AI literacy now outweighs traditional programming skills for breaking into the industry.

Layoffs at major tech firms, AI-driven resume screenings, and an “AI loop” of automated applications and rejections have left many struggling to secure work. The future demands adaptability, AI literacy now outweighs traditional programming skills for breaking into the industry.  In 2012, Microsoft’s senior executive Brad Smith told the world that computer science graduates could expect six-figure salaries, generous hiring bonuses, and stock grants straight out of college, according to The New York Times. The pitch, echoed by billionaires, tech executives, and US presidents, was simple: Learn to code, and a secure, lucrative career awaited. Thirteen years later, that once-shiny promise is fading. The spread of artificial intelligence programming tools, which can generate and debug code within seconds, is reshaping the entry-level tech job market. Combined with sweeping layoffs at companies such as Amazon, Intel, Meta, and Microsoft, the shift is leaving many recent computer science graduates struggling to secure their first positions. The end of a golden pipeline The dream began in the early 2010s, when political leaders and industry giants pushed coding as the skill that would strengthen both individual job prospects and the national economy. Universities expanded computer science programs to meet the demand, and the number of undergraduates majoring in the subject in the United States more than doubled between 2014 and 2024, according to the Computing Research Association. Yet today, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reports that unemployment among recent computer science graduates stands at 6.1%, more than twice the rate for biology or art history majors. For computer engineering graduates, the rate is even higher at 7.5%. Jeff Forbes, a former program director for computer science education at the National Science Foundation, told The New York Times that just a few years ago, graduates could “fight off offers from top firms,” whereas now they are struggling to land any job at all.A hiring process without humans For many graduates, the challenge lies not only in the shortage of openings but also in how hiring processes have evolved. Entry-level roles are often the first to be automated, according to Matthew Martin, a senior economist at Oxford Economics, as reported by The New York Times. Employers increasingly rely on AI systems to scan resumes, reject candidates, and even conduct early interview screenings, often without human oversight. Graduates are trying to adapt by using AI tools themselves, automating resume tailoring and application submissions. But this has created what some call an “AI loop”: Applicants use algorithms to apply, while employers use algorithms to reject. As The New York Times reported, some students receive rejections within minutes of applying.Personal stories of a broken promise Purdue University graduate Manasi Mishra told The New York Times she applied for tech jobs for a year and received only one interview offer, from Chipotle. Oregon State graduate Zach Taylor sent out 5,762 applications and was rejected from all of them. Others, like Clark University’s Audrey Roller, found that rejection emails sometimes arrived just three minutes after submission. These experiences have left many feeling “gaslit” about their futures. Students who once believed coding was a guaranteed ticket to stability now face a market that values AI literacy over traditional programming skills — skills that many universities only recently began teaching.Shifting priorities towards AI In response, major players are pivoting. Microsoft has pledged $4 billion for AI training initiatives, and national policies are beginning to focus on preparing students for AI-related roles. But for those graduating now, these changes offer little immediate relief. As 2025 unfolds, the message to future computer science students may no longer be “just learn to code.” Instead, it is becoming a lesson in adaptability: Learn to work alongside AI, understand its tools and limits, and prepare for a career where the entry-level gateway is no longer guaranteed. The story of how AI reshapes this generation’s career paths is still being written. For many, the first chapter is a harsh awakening from the promise they were sold in high school, a promise that technology would always need them.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.
