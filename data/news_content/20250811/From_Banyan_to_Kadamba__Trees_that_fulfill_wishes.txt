From the wish-granting tree of Kalpavriksha to Shri Krishana’s favourite Kadamba, these unique trees have been revered for centuries. Let us take a look at them one by one2/5Banyan: Tree of lifeThe banyan tree often represents the Trimūrti, the three lords of cosmic creation, preservation, and destruction-namely, Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Shiva. It is often used for metaphorical reference in the Vedic scriptures written in ancient Sanskrit manuscripts. With its ever-spreading roots and branches, it is also symbolic of life and fertility in the Indian culture and is consequently worshipped by those who wish to have children. The revered banyan tree is never cut, and thus often grows over many acres.3/5Kadamba treeCommon Bur Flower or Kadam (Neolamarckia Cadamba) is a large, evergreen tree with beautiful & unique flowers. It is a fast-growing tree with a broad crown and is even planted sacredly near temples. In Hindu mythology, the Kadam tree is the favourite tree of Lord Krishna, who is usually depicted playing his flute under it. He also used to play with his friends under the Kadam tree in Vrindavan, using the unique globular flower of the tree. Hence, the tree is also known as Haripriya, God's favourite.4/5Bael: The medicinal plantThe bael is a slender, aromatic tree that bears a sweet, yellow-green fruit. It is a medicinal plant as well as a sacred tree. All parts of it are used for different healing purposes-the roots, leaves, and fruits-and it has proven effective in combating many different kinds of bacteria. It is known as “Sivadruma”, and the leaves are often offered to Lord Shiva, who is known to be particularly pleased by this tree. Baels have trifoliate leaves, i.e., a leaf structure of three, and this is sometimes thought to symbolize Siva’s trident or the Trimūrti, Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh.5/5Peepal: Tree of enlightenmentThis tree, also known as “Ashvatta,” is purportedly the most worshipped tree in India. Lord Krishna, the original incarnation of Lord Vishnu and the supreme lord of the universe according to the legends, identifies with the peepul in the sacred text Bhagavad Gita. He states, “Of all trees, I am the holy fig tree (Bhagavad Gita Verse 10.26).” In addition, the Hindus associate the roots of the tree with Lord Brahma (the creator of the universe), the trunk of the tree with Lord Vishnu (the protector and preserver), and the leaves of the tree with Lord Shiva (the destroyer).Follow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous10 animals that can survive intense radiationLifestyle10 Indian states with maximum number of National ParkstravelHow to make natural hair colour using tea and coffeeLifestyleDivyanka Tripathi’s top 10 stylish must-have lookstv​How to make dhaba-style Egg Curry at home​Food9 heart-healthy foods that cut attack and stroke riskLifestyleSaniya Iyappan steals the spotlight with her graceEntertainmentCarrie Coon’s secret weapon on TV?
