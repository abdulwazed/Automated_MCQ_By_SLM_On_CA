Avocados can also interfere with blood-thinning medications because of their vitamin K levels and potentially trigger migraines in susceptible individuals.  Avocados are a popular superfood known for their creamy texture and rich nutrient profile, including healthy fats, fibre, and vitamins.

Overconsumption may lead to digestive issues like bloating and gas, especially in individuals with sensitive stomachs or IBS. Due to their high calorie content, excessive intake can contribute to weight gain. Avocados also contain vitamin K, which may interfere with blood-thinning medications.
