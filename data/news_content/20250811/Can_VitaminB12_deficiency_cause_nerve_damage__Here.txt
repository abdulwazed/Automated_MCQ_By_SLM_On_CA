Low levels can cause tingling and numbness. It may also lead to balance problems and memory loss. If not treated, nerve damage can become permanent. Vegans and older adults are at higher risk. Blood tests can check B12 levels. Treatment includes supplements or injections. Early action is key to prevent lasting harm.  Vitamin B12 plays a vital role in maintaining the health of the nervous system, including the brain, nerves, and spinal cord. A deficiency in this essential nutrient can lead to a range of neurological symptoms, such as tingling, numbness, poor coordination, memory loss, and mood changes. If left untreated, prolonged vitamin B12 deficiency may result in irreversible nerve damage. This is particularly concerning as neurological symptoms can appear before signs of anaemia. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent long-term complications. Regular monitoring and a balanced diet or supplementation can help maintain healthy B12 levels and protect nerve health.What is Vitamin B12: Signs of deficiency that affects nerve healthVitamin B12 (also known as cobalamin) helps produce red blood cells, supports DNA synthesis, and plays a key role in maintaining healthy nerve cells. It’s naturally found in animal-based foods such as meat, fish, eggs, and dairy. People following plant-based diets, or those with medical conditions affecting absorption, are most at risk of developing a deficiency.Vitamin B12 rich foods for vegetarian dietVitamin B12 deficiency can lead to neurological symptoms even before blood levels drop enough to cause anaemia. Common nerve-related signs include:Tingling or numbness in the hands, feet, or legsBalance issues or frequent fallsWeakness in musclesMemory loss or difficulty concentratingMood changes, including depression or irritabilityBurning sensations in extremitiesCoordination problems while walkingThese symptoms may begin subtly but can worsen over time, especially if not addressed early.How low Vitamin B12 causes nerve damageVitamin B12 is vital for the production of myelin – the protective coating around nerves. When B12 is deficient, myelin begins to break down, exposing nerves to damage. This can disrupt communication between the brain and the rest of the body, resulting in symptoms like numbness, weakness, and cognitive issues.In severe cases, B12 deficiency can lead to subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, a serious neurological condition that may cause:Stiffness in the limbsPoor coordinationDifficulty walkingLoss of vibration or position senseIf untreated, some of this nerve damage may become permanent.Who is at risk of Vitamin B12 deficiencyVitamin B12 deficiency can affect anyone, but some groups are more vulnerable:Older adults (reduced absorption with age)Vegans and vegetarians (plant foods lack natural B12)People with gastrointestinal conditions, such as Crohn’s disease or coeliac diseaseThose taking certain medications, like metformin or proton pump inhibitorsPatients who have had bariatric or stomach surgeryTreatment options for VitaminB12 deficiency typically includes:Vitamin B12 injections for severe deficiency or poor absorptionOral B12 supplements for mild casesDietary changes to include B12-rich or fortified foodsImprovements may take weeks or months depending on how long the deficiency has been present.When to see a doctorIf you experience symptoms like persistent numbness, tingling, balance issues, or mental fog, speak to your GP. A simple blood test can check your B12 levels. Your doctor may also test homocysteine or methylmalonic acid (MMA) if results are borderline.Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent long-term nerve damage.Frequently Asked QuestionsQ1.
