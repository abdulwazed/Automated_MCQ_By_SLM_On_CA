SUBSCRIBE NOW!Citing the examples of legendary Indian batters Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar, who rated the Kanga League highly in their playing days, Sarfaraz shared his thoughts.“During my childhood, I heard many stories from my father (Naushad Khan) about how Sunil Gavaskar sir once turned up for a Kanga League match despite returning from England the same morning,” Sarfaraz told Mid-day.“So, Musheer (my younger brother) and I have always taken pride in playing this tournament. While returning from Nagpur last evening (Saturday), we were hoping it wouldn’t rain today.PollDo you think the Kanga League is essential for Mumbai cricketers?Yes, it's crucial for development.No, it's not necessary.“It rained a bit this morning, but when I reached Islam Gymkhana, the weather was good. I played my last Kanga League match three years ago.“I was going through the league fixture book before this game and saw my name in it for scoring a century in 2018, and it felt nice.”Sarfaraz explained why all Mumbai cricketers must play in the Kanga League. He said: “All Mumbai players should play the Kanga League. Some players feel that if they fail here, it’ll be bad for their future.“But if Gavaskar sir and Sachin Tendulkar sir thought the same way, they might not have gone on to become legends.“If big players participate in this tournament, it will be an inspiration for the city’s youngsters.“Kanga League is such a tournament that if you succeed here, you can score runs anywhere in the world.”Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
