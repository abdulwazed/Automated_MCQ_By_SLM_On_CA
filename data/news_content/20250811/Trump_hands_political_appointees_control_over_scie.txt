Trump hands political appointees control over science funding: Here’s why researchers are sounding the alarm
President Trump's executive order gives political appointees control over federal science grants, requiring agencies like NIH and NSF to ensure funding aligns with political priorities. Grants can be terminated anytime, raising concerns among researchers about political interference in scientific funding. The order delays new funding announcements and threatens projects on health and public safety. Experts warn this could hinder US research leadership and may face legal challenges.

Trump executive order gives political control over federal science funding. (AI Image) Trump hands political appointees control over science funding: Here's why researchers are sounding the alarmPresident Trump has signed an executive order that grants political appointees increased authority over the allocation of billions of dollars in federal grants across various US government agencies. The order requires agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and FEMA to designate officials responsible for reviewing grant opportunities to ensure they align with agency priorities and the “national interest.”The new directives also allow agencies to terminate existing and future grants at any point during the grant period. This significant shift in the grant process has raised concerns among scientists who warn it could undermine the impartial funding system that has long supported US leadership in research and development.Changes in federal grant oversight and implications for researchUnder the order, no new federal funding opportunities can be announced until the agencies implement the new review protocols. The Trump administration states these measures are intended to “strengthen oversight” and “streamline agency grantmaking.” However, researchers argue the changes introduce political interference into what was previously a merit-based funding process.Joseph Bak-Coleman, a scientist specialising in group decision-making at the University of Washington, said this is “taking political control of a once politically neutral mechanism for funding science in the US,” as quoted by the Associated Press. The move has raised fears that decisions about scientific grants may no longer be based solely on expertise and research merit.Impact on scientific progress and emergency fundingThe changes have already resulted in the termination of thousands of research grants, including projects on transgender health, vaccine hesitancy, misinformation, and diversity, equity, and inclusion, according to the Associated Press. The Association of American Medical Colleges warned that the order will “delay grant review and approval,” slowing progress in critical areas such as cures and treatments urgently needed by patients and families nationwide.Beyond scientific research, the executive order could affect emergency relief grants managed by FEMA, public safety funding through the Department of Justice, and public health programmes supported by the Centres for Disease Control (CDC). Experts suggest that the increased political control over grant distribution may influence the effectiveness of these essential services.Potential legal challenges and future consequencesThe executive order is expected to face legal challenges, as its sweeping changes raise questions about the proper role of political influence in federal grantmaking. The uncertainty caused by the new rules may disrupt ongoing projects and deter future research initiatives, experts say.In summary, the Trump administration's executive order introduces new layers of political oversight into the federal grant system, shifting power to political appointees and raising concerns among the scientific community about the future of unbiased, merit-based funding in the US.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.
