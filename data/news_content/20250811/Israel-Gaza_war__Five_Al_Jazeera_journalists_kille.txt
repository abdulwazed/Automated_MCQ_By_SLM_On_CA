The IDF confirmed targeting Al Jazeera correspondent Anas al-Sharif, alleging he was a Hamas terrorist operative, a claim Al Jazeera denies.  Five Al Jazeera journalists, including well-known correspondent Anas al-Sharif, were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a journalists’ tent in Gaza City on Sunday. The Israeli military confirmed it carried out the strike, accusing al-Sharif of being a Hamas operative who “posed as a journalist” and led a terrorist cell responsible for rocket attacks.Al Jazeera condemned the killings as a “targeted assassination” aimed at silencing independent reporting from Gaza, where international media access remains heavily restricted. The strike marks one of the deadliest incidents for the network since the war began nearly two years ago, during which over 200 media workers have been killed, according to press freedom groups.Gaza: Al Jazeera Staff Killed In Relentless IDF Bombardment, Journo’s Final Message Reveals HorrorThe journalists killed in the Gaza City strikeAl Jazeera confirmed that five of its staff died in the attack: correspondent Anas al-Sharif, fellow reporter Mohammed Qreiqeh, and camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal, and Moamen Aliwa.

Al Jazeera reporter killed in Israeli strikeThe group had been sheltering in a tent opposite Al-Shifa Medical Complex, a site long used by media crews. Al-Sharif, 28, was one of the most recognisable Arabic-language reporters covering the conflict, known for his frontline reports from northern Gaza. Hours before his death, he posted footage on X showing nearby Israeli strikes. The killings have deepened concerns about journalist safety in Gaza, where local reporters provide most coverage due to the ban on foreign press entering without Israeli military escort.'A press badge isn’t a shield for terrorism'In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described Anas al-Sharif as a “Hamas terrorist” who used journalism as cover. They claimed intelligence from Gaza — including rosters, training records, and salary documents — proved his affiliation. According to the IDF, al-Sharif led a Hamas cell responsible for organising rocket attacks on Israeli civilians and troops. “A press badge isn’t a shield for terrorism,” the statement read. The military also accused Al Jazeera of integrating Hamas operatives into its reporting teams. Israel has long accused the Qatar-based network of bias, while Al Jazeera says such claims are politically motivated attempts to justify attacks on its journalists.Al Jazeera’s condemnation and call for accountabilityAl Jazeera condemned the attack as a “blatant and premeditated assault” on press freedom. The network accused Israel of deliberately targeting its journalists following repeated incitement by Israeli officials. It said the slain reporters were among the last to remain in Gaza, providing live, unfiltered accounts of the humanitarian crisis. The broadcaster warned that the killings were part of a wider campaign to “silence the truth” about the war. Calling for urgent international action, Al Jazeera argued that immunity for perpetrators fuels further attacks and urged governments to pressure Israel to halt the targeting of media workers.CPJ and media watchdogs reactThe Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said it was “appalled” by the deaths, warning that Israel’s practice of branding reporters as militants without public evidence raises “serious questions about its respect for press freedom.” CPJ Regional Director Sara Qudah stressed that journalists are civilians and must never be targeted. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) noted that over 200 journalists have been killed in Gaza since the war began, making it one of the deadliest conflicts for media in recent decades. Both organisations called for an independent investigation into the strike and for the protection of reporters working in conflict zones.Tensions between Israel and Al JazeeraIsrael and Al Jazeera have had a strained relationship for years. The Israeli government has banned the broadcaster from operating inside the country, accused it of incitement, and raided its offices. The latest war in Gaza has heightened tensions, with Al Jazeera frequently challenging Israeli narratives about military operations. Qatar, which funds the network, also hosts the political leadership of Hamas and has mediated indirect talks between Israel and the group. Critics say this fuels Israeli mistrust of the channel, while supporters argue it remains one of the few outlets providing on-the-ground coverage from Gaza.Gaza’s media vacuumWith Gaza sealed off from most international journalists, global news organisations rely heavily on local reporters like al-Sharif for coverage. These journalists face extreme danger, lacking the protection afforded to embedded foreign correspondents. Many live under constant bombardment, while also coping with shortages of food, water, and medical care. The deaths of prominent figures such as al-Sharif further diminish the flow of independent reporting from the enclave. UN agencies and rights groups have warned that the loss of these voices leaves the world reliant on official statements and severely limits scrutiny of military actions.Netanyahu’s defence of new military offensiveBefore the strike, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed foreign media, defending Israel’s expanded military operations in Gaza. He insisted Israel must “finish the job” by dismantling Hamas strongholds, not only in Gaza City but also in the central refugee camps and Muwasi. Netanyahu promised “safe zones” for civilians, though similar areas have been bombed in the past. He also announced plans to bring more foreign journalists into Gaza under military supervision. Critics, including the UN, warned that the expansion risks worsening the humanitarian disaster in the territory, which is already facing severe food shortages and mass displacement.International reaction at the UN Security CouncilThe UN Security Council held an emergency meeting after Netanyahu’s announcement, but no concrete action was agreed. The United States defended Israel’s right to act against Hamas, rejecting allegations of genocide. China condemned the “collective punishment” of Gaza’s population, while Russia warned against a “reckless intensification” of hostilities. UN humanitarian official Ramesh Rajasingham said starvation was already occurring, with conditions “beyond horrific.” Rights groups argue that targeting journalists undermines transparency and accountability in such a crisis, making independent reporting all the more crucial.Civilian toll and humanitarian crisisGaza’s health ministry reports more than 61,000 Palestinians killed since the war began, with roughly half being women and children. The conflict has displaced the majority of Gaza’s population and driven parts of the territory into famine. The ministry says at least 100 children and 117 adults have died from malnutrition-related causes since June. Aid delivery remains chaotic, with incidents of gunfire reported near distribution sites. Israel denies pursuing a policy of starvation, blaming shortages on Hamas. Humanitarian agencies say access restrictions and ongoing fighting are preventing sufficient relief efforts.Calls for justice Palestinian officials, press freedom advocates, and humanitarian organisations have called for the killings of al-Sharif and his colleagues to be investigated as war crimes. They argue the strike fits a broader pattern of silencing journalists who document alleged abuses. Al Jazeera says its slain reporters embodied the “courage and resilience” of Gaza’s press, working despite personal risk to expose the war’s impact. As the conflict nears its second year, the network warns that without independent witnesses, the humanitarian crisis will unfold largely unseen — and those responsible will face even less scrutiny.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
