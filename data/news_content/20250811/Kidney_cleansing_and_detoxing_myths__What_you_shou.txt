Detox teas and juices lack scientific support and may harm kidney function. While hydration is important, excessive water intake can strain kidneys. A balanced diet, regular exercise, and managing underlying conditions are proven ways to support kidney health.  Kidney detoxes and cleansing routines have become increasingly popular, often promoted as quick solutions to improve kidney health, remove toxins, or boost overall wellness. From herbal teas to juice fasts, many of these methods promise results that sound too good to be true. The truth is that your kidneys are already excellent at detoxifying your body without any special interventions. Misunderstanding how the kidneys work can lead to unnecessary or even harmful health practices. Falling for these myths may not only waste your time and money but also put your kidney health at risk.What kidney detox myths get wrong about your healthMyth 1: Your kidneys need regular cleansingOne of the most widespread health myths is the idea that your kidneys need to be cleansed or flushed with specific drinks or diets. In reality, healthy kidneys continuously filter your blood, remove waste products, and balance your body's fluids and electrolytes. They do this naturally and efficiently. Unless your kidneys are damaged or diseased, they do not require any external cleansing. The best way to support them is through good nutrition, proper hydration, and regular health checks.Myth 2: Detox teas and juices can repair or improve kidney functionDetox teas, juices, and supplements often claim to remove toxins or enhance kidney function, but these claims are not supported by scientific evidence. Many of these products are unregulated and may contain high levels of certain herbs or diuretics that can stress the kidneys rather than help them. In some cases, they may lead to dehydration or mineral imbalances. If you have any kidney condition, these types of detoxes may do more harm than good.Myth 3: Drinking more water always helps cleanse the kidneysWhile staying hydrated is important for kidney function, more water is not always better. Drinking too much water can dilute essential salts in the body and place strain on the kidneys. People with healthy kidneys should aim to drink according to their body's needs, which can vary based on activity level, environment, and individual health conditions. For most people, drinking when thirsty and monitoring the colour of urine is enough to stay well hydrated.Myth 4: A kidney cleanse helps remove kidney stonesSome believe that consuming large amounts of citrus juice or herbal drinks can flush out kidney stones or prevent their formation. While drinking water and maintaining a balanced diet can help prevent stones in some cases, a true kidney cleanse will not dissolve or remove existing stones. Treatment for kidney stones depends on their size and type and often requires medical supervision. Relying on home remedies could delay proper care and increase the risk of complications.What really supports your kidney healthThe kidneys thrive when you take care of your overall health. The following lifestyle choices are proven to support kidney function:Eat a balanced diet that is low in sodium and processed foodsLimit your intake of red meat and animal fatsStay physically active and maintain a healthy weightAvoid smoking and limit alcohol consumptionManage underlying conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetesStay hydrated without overdoing itAvoid overuse of painkillers and unnecessary supplementsThese habits can help protect your kidneys from damage and reduce your risk of developing chronic kidney disease.Also read | Urine colour and kidney problems: Signs you shouldn’t ignoreAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.
