Pakistan army chief Asim Munir (File photo) NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs (MEA) on Monday hit back at Pakistan army chief Asim Munir’s recent anti-India remarks made in the United States, calling Pakistan "an irresponsible state with nuclear weapons" and adding that "nuclear sabre-rattling is Pakistan’s stock in trade."In an official statement, the MEA said: “Our attention has been drawn to remarks reportedly made by the Pakistani chief of army staff while on a visit to the United States. Nuclear sabre-rattling is Pakistan’s stock in trade.”Reiterating India’s stance, the MEA said: "India has already made it clear that it will not give in to nuclear blackmail. We will continue to take all steps necessary to safeguard our national security."They added: "It is also regrettable that these remarks should have been made from the soil of a friendly third country."PollIs nuclear sabre-rattling becoming a norm in international relations?Yes, it's worrying.No, it's just posturing.Highlighting Pakistan's terrorism problem, failed democracy, and the military’s control over the Islamabad government, news agency PTI said, quoting sources: "The international community can draw its own conclusions on the irresponsibility inherent in such remarks, which also reinforce the well-held doubts about the integrity of nuclear command and control in a state where the military is hand-in-glove with terrorist groups."Op Sindoor: Report Reveals Pakistan Lost Rs 1240cr In 2 Months After Shutting Airspace For IndiaSpeaking at an event in Tampa, Florida, on Sunday, Munir had threatened to destroy any Indian infrastructure that could impact water flow to Pakistan.

We have no shortage of missiles, Alhumdulillah."He also issued a wider nuclear threat, warning: "We are a nuclear nation.
