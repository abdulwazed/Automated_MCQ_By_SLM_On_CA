Amritpal Singh Dhillon, a Canada-returned man, was arrested for fatally hitting 114-year-old marathoner Fauja Singh with a borrowed Fortuner on the Jalandhar-Pathankot highway. Dhillon, who fled the scene, claimed he was unaware of the victim's identity until news reports surfaced.  JALANDHAR: The driver who fatally struck iconic marathoner Fauja Singh on Jalandhar-Pathankot national highway Monday turned out to be a Canada-returned man who sped away after leaving the 114-year-old to die, Punjab police said on Wednesday.The suspect, Amritpal Singh Dhillon (26), was arrested from his home in Dasupur village, 20km from Jalandhar, on Tuesday. The vehicle, a borrowed white Fortuner bearing a Punjab registration number, was seized. According to Jalandhar Rural SSP H S Virk, Dhillon said he did not know it was Singh he had struck, and that he had fled the scene because he was scared.Police have charged him with culpable homicide and rash driving. The police FIR says the vehicle was speeding, and that Singh's life could have been saved had the driver taken him to hospital rather than fleeing.Singh's son, Harbinder, said the driver should have stopped to help his injured father. "We would not have pursued a complaint against him had my father survived. But he should have stopped," he said. Dhillon told police that Singh was crossing the highway and he could not stop in time as the vehicle was going fast, said Virk. tnn'Realised what I had done when I found TV channels reporting Fauja Singh's death' Dhillon was returning home from Bhogpur, a 16km drive that passed via Beas Pind village. As reported by TOI on Wednesday, the marathoner was walking towards his family dhaba across the road when he was struck.During questioning, Dhillon revealed that it was only at night, when TV channels started reporting Fauja Singh's death, that he realised who he had hit and run, said the SSP.According to police officers, Dhillon claimed he felt very guilty after that. However, he did not come forward to take responsibility for the death that was mourned by the world.It took meticulous detective work to track down the vehicle and the driver.At a press conference on Wednesday, SSP Virk said an eyewitness told police that the vehicle that hit Fauja Singh could have been an Innova or a Fortuner. "We recovered a damaged part of a headlight and when we checked with Toyota agencies, we were told that it could be an old Fortuner from the 2009, 2010, or 2011 models. Then, from CCTV footage, we zeroed in on a Fortuner and also found a damaged headlight from one particular CCTV. We found the registration number from CCTV footage. Investigations revealed that the vehicle had been sold a couple of times," he said. By Tuesday, police felt sure they had the right suspect. And the same night a police team arrived at Dhillon's doorstep.The SSP said Dhillon had gone to Canada on a tourist visa eight years ago and stayed back on getting a work permit. His sisters live there, too. He was in the construction business and has a work visa until 2027. He had come to India on June 23 on an emergency certificate as he had lost his passport. Three weeks into his homecoming, he is now behind bars, accused of killing a legend who seemed to outpace time. Dhillon was produced in a local court on Wednesday and remanded in jail.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousTop 7 compatibility tests for couples on US road tripsLifestyleTop 10 unique love languages of the US couplesLifestyleAvneet Kaur’s Gen-Z street glam is a whole moodtvYamini Singh radiates charm in vibrant traditional wearEntertainmentMulti-layered to florals: Trending diamond-studded payal designsLifestyleBaby boy names that mean warrior!Lifestyle8 books that teach life lessons you’ll never forgetLifestyleNisarga Gowda’s top 10 saree lookstv8 plants that invite pollinators to your balcony gardenLifestyleAdorable bridal looks of Tamil TV actressestv Next123 Photostories  Sai Pallavi to Anushka Shetty: 5 old-school blouse designs inspired by South Indian actresses7 ways to keep Cancer away (from a researcher who has studied the condition for 30 years)Unforgettable relationships that shaped the soul of hindi cinemaWhat happens when you consume Desi Dates (Khajoor) during monsoon and the right way to consume themBigg Boss Malayalam contestants who missed the winner’s trophy but won millions of heartsThe Sky’s the Limit: Know all about the 5 Longest Flights in the WorldTired, bloated, or overheated?
