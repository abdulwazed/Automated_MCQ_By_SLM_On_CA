MS Dhoni (PTI Photo) NEW DELHI: Ahead of the next edition of the Indian Premier League in 2026, the speculations over MS Dhoni's future with the Chennai Super Kings refuses to die down. After a bottom-of-the-table finish in IPL 2025, the big question is whether the five-time champions' long-time talisman will return for one more season.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!The 44-year-old, who has been battling persistent knee issues, made a public appearance recently where he was quizzed about his plans for IPL 2026.More Than a Team: The Rise of CSK & the Whistle Podu Army“I don't know whether I'll play or not. I have time to decide. I have some time until December, so I'll take another couple of months, and then finally, I can make my decision,” Dhoni told the host.From the crowd, a fan passionately urged, “You have to play, sir.” Dhoni, known for his sharp wit, instantly drew laughter with his response: “Arre, ghutne me jo dard hota hai uska take care kaun karega? (The pain I have in my knees, who will take care of that?)”The video of the interaction has since went viral on social media, WATCH:Dhoni's knee has been a talking point for the past few seasons. Right after leading CSK to a dramatic title in IPL 2023 by defeating Gujarat Titans, he underwent surgery in Mumbai. The veteran wicketkeeper-batter had played that season through discomfort, delaying the operation until after the campaign to allow a proper rehabilitation period before IPL 2024.In the last two editions, Dhoni has batted lower down the order, largely to manage his knee issue.Whether he dons the yellow jersey again in 2026 remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: with every witty one-liner, Dhoni is keeping fans guessing — and the conversation alive.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
