One Twitter user wrote, "Please follow the rules Yesterday at Airport security , Allu Arjun was stopped by an officer and asked to show his face with Id. Allu was initially reluctant, and after a brief exchange of words, his assistant tried to convince the officer that he was Allu Arjun. Even then, the officer insisted on seeing his face. The actor eventually showed face, but only partially and for a very brief moment. It’s understandable that celebrities may cover their faces to avoid being pestered for photos by co-passengers. But at a security screening, Face id rules shouldn’t be bypassed. If someone were allowed into a secured zone without properly showing their face, wouldn’t that make us feel unsafe?"Allu Arjun’s 'protective dad' move melts hearts during family dinner outingAnother comment read, "The security should get a pay hike immediately ." A third comment read, "Airport screening rules are for everyone.. not just common passengers. Security is the same for celebrities, VIPs, and the public."Allu Arjun’s upcoming projectsAfter 'Pushpa 2', fans eagerly await his next big release which is Atlee’s highly anticipated film 'AA22xA6'.
