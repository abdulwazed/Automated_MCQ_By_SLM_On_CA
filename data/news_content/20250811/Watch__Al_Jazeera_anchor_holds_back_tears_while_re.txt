The deceased journalists, including prominent correspondent Anas al-Sharif, were sheltering in a tent near the Al-Shifa Medical Complex.  Al Jazeera news anchor held back his tears while reporting about the death of his five colleagues, who lost their lives in an Israeli strike on Sunday. A video is going viral where an Al Jazeera anchor was seen holding back his tears while reporting. On Sunday, five Al Jazeera journalists, including well-known correspondent Anas al-Sharif, were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a journalists’ tent in Gaza City. Al Jazeera confirmed that five of its staff were killed in the strike: correspondent Anas al-Sharif, reporter Mohammed Qreiqeh, and camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal, and Moamen Aliwa. The group had been sheltering in a tent across from the Al-Shifa Medical Complex — a long-time base for media crews. Al-Sharif, 28, was among the most recognisable Arabic-language reporters covering the war, famed for his frontline dispatches from northern Gaza.  Their deaths have intensified concerns over journalist safety in Gaza, where local reporters shoulder almost all frontline coverage due to the ban on foreign press entering without an Israeli military escort.In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described Anas al-Sharif as a “Hamas terrorist” who used journalism as cover. They claimed intelligence from Gaza, including rosters, training records, and salary documents — proved his affiliation. According to the IDF, al-Sharif led a Hamas cell responsible for organising rocket attacks on Israeli civilians and troops. “A press badge isn’t a shield for terrorism,” the statement read. The military also accused Al Jazeera of integrating Hamas operatives into its reporting teams. Israel has long accused the Qatar-based network of bias, while Al Jazeera says such claims are politically motivated attempts to justify attacks on its journalists.Al Jazeera condemned the strike as a “blatant and premeditated assault” on press freedom, accusing Israel of deliberately targeting its journalists after repeated incitement by Israeli officials. The network said the slain reporters were among the last still operating in Gaza, delivering live, unfiltered accounts of the humanitarian crisis. The broadcaster warned the killings were part of a broader effort to “silence the truth” about the war, and called for urgent international intervention. It argued that the continued impunity for such attacks only emboldens further violence against the press, urging governments to pressure Israel to stop targeting media workers.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
