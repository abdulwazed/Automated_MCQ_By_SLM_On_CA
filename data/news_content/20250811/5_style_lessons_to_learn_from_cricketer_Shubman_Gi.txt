If Virat Kohli was the poster boy for sporty-meets-slick dressing in the last decade, Gill is the Gen-Z evolution: a blend of quiet luxury, streetwear confidence, and just the right amount of boyish charm.From airport runs to ad campaigns, his wardrobe choices tell us one thing, Shubman knows the game when it comes to style just as much as he does cricket. Here are five fashion lessons to take straight from the captain’s playbook.by TOI Lifestyle Desk 2/7Master the imnimalist athleisureAthleisure might feel like old news, but Gill’s approach keeps it fresh. He gravitates towards clean joggers, crisp crew-neck tees, fitted track jackets, and statement sneakers but with a muted palette. No screaming neons, no over-the-top graphics - just carefully chosen, well-fitted pieces. Think Rahul Khanna’s subtle elegance meets KL Rahul’s sporty edge.The takeaway: Your gym wear can double as your casualwear if you keep it neutral, fitted, and polished.3/7Invest in statement jacketsWhether it’s a bomber in deep forest green, a varsity jacket with bold lettering, or a tailored overcoat for winter tours abroad, Shubman treats jackets like sartorial punctuation marks. They finish his outfit with personality, much like Ranbir Kapoor’s off-duty looks or even David Beckham’s classic layering game.The takeaway: A good jacket doesn’t just keep you warm, it can carry an entire look.4/7Keep denim simple but sharpGill avoids the trap of over-distressed or overly baggy jeans. His go-to? Mid- to dark-wash denims with a straight or slim fit, paired with either a tucked-in shirt for a slightly retro vibe or a hoodie for casual comfort. The fit is never sloppy, more Shahid Kapoor’s tailored casuals than anything grungy.The takeaway: A well-fitted pair of jeans can last you seasons, both in durability and relevance.5/7Embrace monochrome momentsFrom head-to-toe black at the airport to all-white for summer outings, Shubman understands the power of a single-colour statement. It’s sleek, elongating, and always photogenic. In fact, one could argue it’s his version of a “uniform,” much like how Anand Ahuja built his signature sneaker-with-suit look.The takeaway: Don’t fear monochrome, it’s not boring if you mix textures and tones.6/7​Accessorise with restraintWhile some sports stars pile on chains, caps, and oversized shades, Gill opts for a more balanced approach. A single luxury watch, a subtle cap, or a pair of aviators, never all at once. His accessories are functional yet aspirational, much like the way Hrithik Roshan styles his off-duty looks.The takeaway: Let accessories enhance, not overwhelm, your outfit.7/7​Bonus lesson - grooming mattersIt’s impossible to talk about Shubman Gill’s style without mentioning his grooming. The always-on-point fade, the occasional stubble, and skin that somehow always looks camera-ready, it’s the cricketing equivalent of a red-carpet prep. Like David Warner said about cricket, “Preparation is everything,” and in Gill’s case, that includes his hair and skin game.Shubman Gill is proof that you don’t have to be in Bollywood to have a blockbuster wardrobe. His style is approachable yet aspirational, a mix of pieces you can find on the high street and the occasional big-ticket splurge. He isn’t trying too hard, but he’s paying attention and in fashion, much like cricket, that’s how you win the match.Whether you are a cricket fan or just looking for some wardrobe cues, consider Gill your new style captain. And remember: sometimes the most stylish move is knowing when to play it safe and when to take a risk, on the field and in your closet.Follow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousSharvari Wagh brings charm to every pink detailindia10 animals that can survive intense radiationindia10 Indian states with maximum number of National ParkstravelHow to make natural hair colour using tea and coffeeindiaDivyanka Tripathi’s top 10 stylish must-have looksindia​How to make dhaba-style Egg Curry at home​Food9 heart-healthy foods that cut attack and stroke riskindiaSaniya Iyappan steals the spotlight with her graceindiaCarrie Coon’s secret weapon on TV?
