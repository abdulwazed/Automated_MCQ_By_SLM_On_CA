Representative image (ANI) NEW DELHI: Air India’s Thiruvananthapuram (TRV)-Delhi flight AI 2455 on Sunday night with several MPs among the passengers safely diverted to Chennai following a suspected snag — weather radar malfunction. The aircraft, an Airbus A320neo (VT-TNL), hovered arbiter Chennai for some time to burn off fuel and avoid an overweight landing. On its approach to Chennai, the plane was given a go-around by the air traffic control (ATC) — meaning asked to abort landing and then touch down in second attempt — due to debris on the runway, which the pilots executed safely. On landing, say sources, no fault was detected in the weather radar during checks but still as a precautionary measure a key component — trans receiver — was replaced.In a detailed statement, the DGCA said: “On Aug 10, 2025, Air India A320 aircraft VT-TNL was scheduled to operate flight AI2455 (TRV-Delhi) with scheduled time of departure as 7.15 pm. Due to late arrival of aircraft from Delhi, aircraft departed TRV at 8.04 pm. During flight, the aircraft encountered moderate turbulent conditions. Crew observed that weather information depicted on the weather radar was not accurate. Suspecting weather radar malfunction, they diverted to Chennai.”AI171 crash: Lawyer meets survivor’s family, seeks answers from Boeing“To avoid overweight landing and burn extra fuel, the aircraft with air traffic control (ATC) clearance orbited 25 nautical miles northeast of Chennai for 43 minutes (from 9.25 pm to 10.08 pm). After the aircraft was cleared for approach runway 25 at Chennai, (crew was) at 10.19 pm was instructed to carry out a missed approach by ATC as departing Gulf Air flight GFA 53(Chennai-Bahrain) reported debris on left side of runway.” Apron control carried out inspection of the runway and nothing was observed. The AI aircraft was given landing clearance and aircraft landed safely at 10.39 pm. “During engineering inspection no deficiency was observed. However, as a precautionary measure, weather radar transreceiver was replaced with a serviceable one,” the DGCA said.PollIs it important for airlines to provide passengers with real-time updates during emergencies? Very important Somewhat importantA combination of multiple factors including slight delayed departure from TRV, bad weather, announcement of the flight diverting due to a snag, hovering over Chennai and then a go-around added to the anxiety of passengers. Congress MP K C Venugopal who represents Alappuzha in Lok Sabha was among the parliamentarians on board. He said on X early Monday morning: “AI 2455 from Trivandrum to Delhi, carrying myself, several MPs, and hundreds of passengers, came frighteningly close to tragedy. What began as a delayed departure turned into a harrowing journey. Shortly after take-off, we were hit by unprecedented turbulence. About an hour later, the captain announced a flight signal fault and diverted to Chennai.”“For nearly two hours, we circled the airport awaiting clearance to land, until a heart-stopping moment during our first attempt — another aircraft was reportedly on the same runway. In that split second, the captain’s quick decision to pull up saved every life on board. The flight landed safely on the second attempt. We were saved by skill and luck. Passenger safety cannot depend on luck. I urge DGCA and aviation ministry to investigate this incident urgently, fix accountability, and ensure such lapses never happen again,” Venugopal added.Aircraft routinely go around for safety reasons due to a number of factors like unstabilised approach or a plane/vehicle being on the runway it is supposed to land on. Air India denied that AI 2455 was asked to go around because there was another aircraft on the runway.An AI spokesperson said: “The flight crew of AI2455 operating from Thiruvananthapuram to Delhi on August 10 made a precautionary diversion to Chennai due to a suspected technical issue and given the weather conditions enroute. The flight landed safely in Chennai, where the aircraft will undergo the necessary checks. We regret the inconvenience caused to affected passengers…. At AI, safety of our passengers and crew remain top priority.”Congress MP for Virudhunagar Manickam Tagore B who as also on board said on X: “Shocked & shaken. Air India AI 2455 from TRV to Delhi, carrying MPs & hundreds of passengers, narrowly escaped disaster today — turbulence, flight signal fault, and a near runway collision in Chennai…. Passenger safety cannot rely on luck. We demand answers & action now.”Replying to him, AI said: “…diversion to Chennai was precautionary, due to a suspected technical issue and poor weather conditions. A go-around was instructed by Chennai ATC during the first attempted landing, not because of the presence of another aircraft on the runway. Our pilots are well-trained to handle such situations, and in this case, they followed standard procedures throughout the flight…”Air India arranged another Airbus A320neo, VT-TQE, which flew the passengers from Chennai to Delhi as AI 2455. The usual flying time of AI 2455 (TRV-Delhi) is 3.5 hours with a schedule departure time 7.15 pm. According to flight tracking sites, it took off with a slight delay on Sunday at 8 pm & landed in Chennai at 10.39 pm. The alternate aircraft took off from Chennai at 1.40 am & landed in Delhi at about 4 am.Seasoned aviators say while AI 2455 had a routine suspected snag, passenger anxiety levels have expectedly been higher post the deadly June 12 AI 171 crash in Ahmedabad and subsequent incidents.
