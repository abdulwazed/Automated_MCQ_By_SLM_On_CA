Salman Khan's Tiger and Shah Rukh Khan's Pathaan will not appear. Bobby Deol will enter the YRF Spy Universe as a key villain. The film will set up the next chapter, Alpha. Directed by Ayan Mukerji, War 2 releases on August 14, 2025.  The much-awaited ‘War 2’ is already creating buzz for bringing Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR together on screen for the first time. Putting an end to the rumour mills with a surprise twist, reports suggest that Salman Khan’s Tiger and Shah Rukh Khan’s Pathaan won’t be making appearances. Instead, Bobby Deol will make a game-changing entry.No Tiger or Pathaan cameo this timeFor months, there had been talk that ‘War 2’ would feature explosive end-credit cameos from the YRF Spy Universe’s biggest names, Salman Khan’s Tiger or Shah Rukh Khan’s Pathaan. However, sources now reveal that neither of the fan-favourite agents will show up.Hrithik and Jr NTR ignite the dance floor in 'War 2' teaser!According to a Bollywood Hungama report, “War 2 won’t feature either of Tiger or Pathaan's character portrayed by Salman Khan and Shah Rukjh Khan respectively, however, their names will be used at some key junctures of the film. The end credit sequence of War 2 will act as a build up for the next chapter of YRF Spy Universe – Alpha. Aditya Chopra is staying true to his vision of continuing the story forward, rather than opting for gimmicks by bringing all 3 superstars in the same film. He is reserving the union of all 3 superstars for a mega project, which is in the development stage.”Setting up the next big chapterThe absence of Tiger and Pathaan isn’t just a missing star moment, it’s part of a bigger plan. The end credits will lead directly into the next spy thriller, ‘Alpha’, instead of being a flashy cameo scene. This means fans can expect the storyline to keep flowing naturally, rather than being interrupted by quick appearances.Bobby Deol enters with a bangRather than banking on Salman or Shah Rukh’s brief appearances, the makers have decided to use ‘War 2’ to introduce a new and important character. And it’s none other than Bobby Deol.The report further states, “With War 2, Aditya Chopra will be establishing Bobby Deol to the Universe. It’s an epic introduction to Bobby Deol’s character, who is one of the main villains in the timeline going forward. Aditya Chopra is known to go against the tide, and instead of establishing his two female leads of Alpha, Alia Bhatt and Sharvari – he is going ahead by unleashing the negative force of the film, Bobby Deol.”About ‘War 2’ and its big starsDirected by Ayan Mukerji, ‘War 2’ is the sixth film in the YRF Spy Universe. It is set to release in Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu on 14 August 2025. The movie stars Hrithik Roshan, Jr NTR, and Kiara Advani in key roles.The story sees a powerful face-off between Hrithik Roshan’s Major Kabir Dhaliwal and Jr NTR’s Vikram. Both are Indian spies, but their beliefs about patriotism clash sharply, turning their rivalry into a battle of ideals as well as action. Kiara Advani plays Kavya Luthra, a central figure who plays an important role in how events unfold.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
