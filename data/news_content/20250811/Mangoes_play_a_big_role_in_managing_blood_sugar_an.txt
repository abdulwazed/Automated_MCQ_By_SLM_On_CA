Mangoes, rich in fibre and antioxidants, can improve insulin sensitivity and regulate glucose levels. Moderate consumption, combined with a balanced diet, supports metabolic and overall wellness.  Emerging research highlights fresh mango as a potentially beneficial fruit for managing blood sugar and reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes. Rich in fibre, antioxidants, and essential nutrients, mangoes may improve insulin sensitivity and help regulate glucose levels, especially in overweight or obese individuals. One controlled trial demonstrated that daily mango consumption led to improved insulin response and stable body weight compared to other calorie-matched snacks. Despite their natural sugar content, moderate intake of mangoes as part of a balanced diet can support metabolic health. Including fresh mango regularly might be a simple, nutritious way to aid blood sugar management and overall wellness.Mango benefits for type 2 diabetes: Study shows improved blood sugar controlAn 8-week randomised controlled trial conducted by Fortis C-DOC Hospital and the National Diabetes, Obesity, and Cholesterol Foundation (N-DOC), New Delhi, assessed the effects of mango intake in adults with type 2 diabetes. Participants consumed 250 grams (roughly one small mango) of Safeda or Dasheri mango every morning at breakfast, while a control group ate an equal portion of white bread.The study published in the National Library of Medicine found that the mango groups experienced significantly better blood sugar control, including lower fasting blood glucose levels and enhanced insulin sensitivity, meaning their bodies used insulin more effectively. Additionally, participants showed reductions in HbA1c levels, a key marker for long-term blood sugar management. The glycaemic index of mango was notably lower than that of white bread (70–75), highlighting mango as a favourable option for glycaemic control when consumed mindfully.Mango also supports heart, gut, and metabolic healthBeyond blood sugar benefits, regular mango consumption is linked to improved digestion, reduced cholesterol, enhanced skin and hair health, stronger immune function, and decreased oxidative stress. These advantages stem from mangoes’ high fibre content, powerful antioxidants such as mangiferin, and vital vitamins and minerals. Moreover, mangoes help regulate blood pressure and cholesterol levels, promoting cardiovascular and metabolic wellness.Health risks: Not a cure, but a supportive dietary choiceWhile mango offers many nutritional benefits, it should not be viewed as a cure for diabetes. Due to its moderate glycaemic index and natural sugars, excessive or unbalanced mango consumption could cause blood sugar spikes, especially in people with diabetes. Experts recommend moderation, consuming mango in small portions, pairing it with proteins or healthy fats, and avoiding eating it on an empty stomach. These habits help slow sugar absorption and reduce glycaemic impact.Practical tips for enjoying mango for healthPortion control: Start with half a cup of fresh mango to enjoy sweetness without excess sugar intake.Choose fresh: Fresh mango is preferable over dried or processed types, which often contain added sugars.Pair wisely: Combine mango with protein-rich foods (like yoghurt or nuts) or healthy fats to help stabilise blood glucose.Monitor effects: Those with diabetes should monitor their blood sugar response and consult healthcare professionals for personalised adviceDisclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not replace professional medical advice.
