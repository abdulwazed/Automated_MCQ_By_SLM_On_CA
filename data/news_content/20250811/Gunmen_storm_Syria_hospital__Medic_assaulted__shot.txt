The incident occurred during clashes between Druze militias, tribal groups, and government forces. Syrian authorities have launched an investigation to identify the perpetrators, vowing to bring them to justice regardless of affiliation, while activists claim the attackers were government forces.  A shocking video has emerged from Syria, where armed men in military garb were seen shooting a medical worker at point-blank range. According to news agency AP, the viral footage, published Sunday, captured the horrifying scene at a hospital in Sweida city in southern Syria. The incident appeared to have happened on July 16, as per AP, during clashes between militias of the Druze minority community and armed tribal groups and government forces.The footage published by activist media collective Suwayda 24, a large group of people in scrubs kneeling on the floor and group of armed men standing in front of them. The armed men grab a man and hit him on the head. It appeared that the armed men were going to apprehend the man, but he resisted by wrestling with one of the gunmen. Suddenly, he was shot by an assault rifle and then a second time by another person with a pistol. A man wearing a dark jumpsuit with "Internal Security Forces" written on the back appears to lead the camouflaged gunmen into the facility. Another camera shows a tank stationed just outside the hospital entrance.Activists claim the attackers were Syrian military and security personnel. But a Syrian government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said authorities had not yet confirmed their identity, adding that investigations were underway to determine whether the assailants were affiliated with the government or tribal factions.The interior ministry said deputy minister of interior for security affairs Maj. Gen. Abdul Qader Al-Tahhan has been assigned to oversee the inquiry “to ensure that the perpetrators are identified and arrested as quickly as possible.”"We condemn and denounce this act in the strongest terms," the ministry said in a statement carried by state news agency SANA, vowing that those responsible would be brought to justice "regardless of their affiliations."
