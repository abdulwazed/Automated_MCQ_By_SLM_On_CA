This is their data, not mine. They should take it from their own website. They are just diverting attention. And no one should think this happened only in Bengaluru; it happened in many constituencies. Today, the Election Commission is trying to hide something, but I want to tell you that one day, everything will come out," he said."See the condition of India's democracy. 300 MPs wanted to meet the Election Commission to present a document, but they were not allowed. They are scared. What if 300 MPs come and their truth is revealed? This fight is not political anymore. This fight is for the Constitution and for One Man One Vote... We have clearly shown in Karnataka, it was Multiple Man, Multiple Vote... The entire opposition is fighting against this. It will be very difficult for the Election Commission to hide now," he added.EC, on Monday, again pressed upon Gandhi to either submit a signed declaration or "apologise to the country".Gandhi, on August 7, said internal analysis had projected 16 Lok Sabha seats for Congress in Karnataka, but the party won only nine. Investigating seven surprise defeats, he pointed to Mahadevapura, alleging “vote theft” involving 100,250 ballots.“We found 100,250 votes stolen in five different ways. Duplicate voters, fake and invalid addresses, and bulk voters in a single address, in a building with 50–60 people living. But when we go there, there is no record of those people living there. One family living in that house,” Rahul Gandhi had said.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
