Mamdani, 33, earns $142,000 a year as a state assemblyman and comes from a wealthy family, including a filmmaker mother and a professor father. He currently resides in a one-bedroom apartment in Astoria renting for $2,300 per month.On social media platform X, Cuomo tagged Mamdani, announcing, “Today, I am proud to propose ‘Zohran’s Law,’ a law that will keep the rich out of New York’s affordable housing.” He added, “Let’s build affordable housing that helps the people who need it. Under Zohran’s Law, landlords can no longer rent vacant rent-controlled units to the wealthy.”“You are a rich person stealing affordable housing from the poor. And you’re not the only one. It’s past time we address this injustice. Let’s build a new NYC that works for the people who need it,” Cuomo wrote.Speaking to the New York Post, Cuomo said, “I’m calling the legislation ‘Zohran’s Law.’ We’re not supposed to be providing rent-stabilized apartments to the children of millionaires.” He noted the bill would include a “means test” based on monthly rent and other criteria but did not provide further specifics. The legislation would require approval from the Democratic-controlled state legislature and Governor Kathy Hochul.This latest move follows Cuomo’s earlier attack on Mamdani for occupying a rent-stabilised apartment in an expensive neighborhood. Cuomo said, “Somewhere last night in New York City, a single mother and her children slept at a homeless shelter because you, Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, are occupying her rent-controlled apartment.”He continued, “I am calling on you to move out immediately and give your affordable housing back to an unhoused family who need it. Leaders must show moral clarity. Time to move out.”In response, Mamdani’s campaign dismissed Cuomo’s accusations as desperate mudslinging. Campaign spokeswoman Dora Pekec said, “On the day of the National Dominican Day Parade, as Andrew Cuomo’s desperate, nonsensical attacks continue, Zohran is busy deepening his support from New Yorkers ready for a city they can afford.”She added, “If Mr Cuomo really cared for working people in New York City, he’d commit today to reimburse the taxpayers the $60 million we are spending on his personal legal defense — which could pay for thousands of affordable housing units instead of probing the gynecological records of women he harassed.”Mamdani’s campaign also pointed out that he qualified for the rent-regulated apartment through StreetEasy when his income was $47,000.Cuomo lost the Democratic primary to Mamdani in June but is now running as an independent under the “Fight and Deliver” ballot line. Meanwhile, incumbent Mayor Eric Adams is also running as an independent after withdrawing from the primary amid federal corruption charges, which have since been dropped.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
