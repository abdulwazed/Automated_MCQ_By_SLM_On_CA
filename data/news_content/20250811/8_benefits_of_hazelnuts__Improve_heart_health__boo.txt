Incorporating a moderate amount of hazelnuts into your daily diet can enhance overall well-being, contributing to stronger bones, glowing skin, and reduced inflammation.  Hazelnuts, also called filberts, are more than just a crunchy snack or a sweet ingredient in chocolate spreads. These nutrient-rich nuts are loaded with vitamins, minerals, healthy fats, and powerful antioxidants that make them a true superfood. From protecting your heart and boosting brain function to improving skin glow and supporting digestion, hazelnuts can benefit almost every part of your body. They are also a natural source of protein, fibre, and essential fatty acids, making them an excellent choice for those seeking a balanced and wholesome diet. Whether eaten raw, roasted, or blended into nut butter, adding a handful of hazelnuts to your daily routine can be a delicious way to improve your health and well-being.8 health benefits of hazelnuts to improve your over all health Hazelnuts are packed with antioxidantsStudies published in NIH have confirmed that hazelnuts are rich in vitamin E, manganese, and phenolic compounds, which act as powerful antioxidants. These help protect your cells from oxidative stress, slowing the ageing process and reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease.Surprisingly easy ways to protect your brain and prevent strokeSupport heart health and manage cholesterolStudies in NIH show hazelnuts promote better cholesterol balance by lowering LDL (bad) cholesterol and increasing HDL (good) cholesterol. High in monounsaturated fats and dietary fibre, this combination supports blood vessel flexibility, improves circulation, and reduces the risk of cardiovascular issues.Help regulate blood sugar levelsResearch by NIH confirms that the low glycaemic index of hazelnuts, combined with their magnesium content, supports blood sugar stability. Regular consumption can help those managing type 2 diabetes and may lower the risk of developing insulin resistance.Promote healthy digestionA small handful of hazelnuts provides enough dietary fibre to aid digestion, prevent constipation, and promote healthy gut bacteria. Good digestive health also supports nutrient absorption, ensuring your body makes the most of your meals.Boost brain health and cognitive functionHazelnuts provide essential nutrients for brain performance, including vitamin E, manganese, thiamine, and healthy fats. These nutrients protect brain cells, improve memory, and support sharper mental focus as you age.Enhance skin and hair healthVitamin E and healthy fats in hazelnuts nourish skin cells, helping maintain hydration and elasticity. They also protect against sun damage and oxidative stress. The same nutrients contribute to stronger, shinier hair.Reduce inflammation naturallyResearch by NIH shows that hazelnuts have anti-inflammatory compounds that may reduce chronic inflammation, a root cause of many serious conditions like heart disease, arthritis, and certain cancers.Strengthen bonesWith magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus, hazelnuts support bone density and strength. This makes them a valuable food for preventing osteoporosis and maintaining mobility as you age.How to Enjoy Hazelnuts SafelyHazelnuts may be a nutritional powerhouse, but like most nuts, they are calorie-dense, meaning it’s easy to overeat them without realising. To enjoy their health benefits without consuming excess calories, aim for a serving of 20–30 grams per day roughly a small handful. This amount is enough to provide essential vitamins, minerals, healthy fats, and antioxidants without significantly affecting your daily calorie balance.If you have a nut allergy, it’s best to avoid hazelnuts completely, as even small traces can trigger reactions. For everyone else, there are plenty of delicious ways to include them in your diet. You can eat them raw for maximum nutrient retention, roast them for a deeper flavour, sprinkle chopped hazelnuts over salads or yoghurt, blend them into smoothies for a creamy texture, or enjoy them as a natural hazelnut butter. Pairing hazelnuts with fresh fruit, dark chocolate, or whole grains can also create tasty, balanced snacks that keep you full for longer.From heart health and brain support to glowing skin, better digestion, and stronger bones, hazelnuts are a versatile superfood worth adding to your diet. Just remember, moderation is key. Enjoy them regularly as part of a balanced diet, and their benefits will reward you for years to come.Also read| 10 benefits of karela juice daily: Boost immunity, manage blood sugar, support digestionAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.
