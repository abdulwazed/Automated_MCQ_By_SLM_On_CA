How Trump’s executive order could reshape college admissions and campus diversity across the US
The Trump administration’s executive order mandates universities to publicly disclose applicants’ race, test scores, and GPAs, intensifying debates over fairness and diversity in college admissions. Following the Supreme Court’s ban on race-based admissions, the policy may push schools toward test-score-focused decisions, potentially disadvantaging low-income and minority students, while reshaping how merit and diversity are balanced nationwide.

Following the Supreme Court’s ban on race-based admissions, the policy may push schools toward test-score-focused decisions, potentially disadvantaging low-income and minority students, while reshaping how merit and diversity are balanced nationwide.  The Trump administration recently issued an executive order requiring universities to publicly disclose detailed information about the race, test scores, and grade point averages of all applicants. This move intensifies an already heated national debate over college admissions, meritocracy, and campus diversity. According to The New York Times, the new data disclosure rules aim to increase transparency but could also shift admissions practices in ways that affect student diversity across the country’s most selective institutions.A century-long debate over admissions For more than a century, colleges have grappled with the question of how to admit students fairly. The controversy touches on fundamental issues such as equal opportunity, racial justice, and the definition of merit. Traditionally, many colleges have used holistic admissions processes that consider applicants’ life experiences, including race and socio-economic background, to build diverse and inclusive campuses. However, conservative groups argue that such subjective criteria can lead to unfair advantages for certain groups and discrimination against others, particularly white and Asian students.Supreme Court ruling and new federal requirements In 2023, the Supreme Court ruled that considering race in admissions decisions was unconstitutional. This ruling forced universities to overhaul their admissions policies to comply with the new legal framework. Building on that decision, the Trump administration’s executive order now requires colleges to report applicant data to a federal database called the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). Education Secretary Linda McMahon emphasised that this data will help the public see whether colleges admit students based on merit or race, stating, according to The New York Times, it “will enable the American public to assess whether schools are passing over the most qualified students in favor of others based on their race.”The pressure to prioritise test scoresAccording to The New York Times, experts warn that this focus on quantitative measures like test scores and grade point averages could unintentionally favour wealthier students who often have access to better preparation and resources from an early age. James Murphy, director of postsecondary policy at Education Reform Now, told The New York Times, “I think the incentives that this creates are a big deal. It is creating pressure on colleges to focus on higher G.P.A.s and higher test scores.”The history and impact of standardised testing The use of standardised test scores in admissions has a complex history. In the early 20th century, colleges prioritised intangible qualities such as character, leadership, and athletic ability. These factors sometimes served as barriers for certain groups, including Jewish students. After World War II, as the United States faced global competition, universities shifted focus towards academic metrics like the SAT. However, this shift has been challenged by civil rights advocates seeking more inclusive admissions policies.Income and racial disparities in test scores Research highlighted by The New York Times shows significant disparities in test scores tied to family income. For example, students from affluent households are seven times more likely to score at least 1300 on the SAT compared to those from low-income families. Among the high school class of 2024, just 1% of Black students and 2% of Hispanic students scored between 1400 and 1600, the highest SAT range. By contrast, 7% of white students and 27% of Asian students reached that score bracket. Admissions beyond test scores Given these disparities, very few elite colleges admit students solely based on test scores today. They also consider legacy status, special talents, and economic adversity to create a more balanced student body. Boston University professor Anthony Abraham Jack told The New York Times that the new order could push admissions towards a “quota system for wealthy and white students.” He cautioned, “If your class is too brown, too poor, then somehow you rigged the system.” Jack stressed the importance of context in evaluating applicants, telling The New York Times, “If you have a student who gets a 5 in A.P. calculus, that doesn’t give you a relative understanding of how good they are. What if they’re the only young woman in the entire state to get a 5 in A.P. calc? That tells you how amazing that person is.”What this means for students As the admissions landscape shifts, students and families may find it harder or easier to understand what it takes to gain entry into selective colleges. The Trump administration’s push for more standardised, data-driven admissions decisions may narrow the path for many, especially students from diverse and disadvantaged backgrounds. The debate continues as universities strive to balance fairness, diversity, and academic excellence in an evolving legal and political environment.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.
