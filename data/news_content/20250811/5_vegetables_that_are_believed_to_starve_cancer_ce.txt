However, the good news is that with the right lifestyle, exercise, and diet you can reduce your chances of getting cancer, or even help combat it. And when it comes to diet, the body uses specific compounds in particular vegetables to combat cancer through three mechanisms that include slowing tumor growth, while strengthening immunity and protecting cellular integrity. Here are 5 such vegetables that can 'starve' cancer... (please note they cannot cure cancer, nor are a substitute to any line of cancer treatment)2/7BroccoliThe cruciferous family includes broccoli as one of its members together with cauliflower, cabbage and Brussels sprouts. The compound sulforaphane present in broccoli, activates protective enzymes in the body, while helping it eliminate cancer-causing chemicals. The compound sulforaphane within the body functions to eliminate cancer stem cells, which sustain tumor growth. Regular broccoli consumption helps your body fight breast, prostate, lung and colon cancers through its natural protective mechanisms. The nutrient content of broccoli includes both fiber and vitamins C and K, which help maintain good health. Using broccoli in meals helps decrease inflammation, which acts as a major factor in cancer development.3/7TomatoesLycopene in tomatoes makes this vegetable a leading cancer fighter. The antioxidant property of lycopene protects cells while lowering prostate cancer risks among other types of cancer. The antioxidants vitamins A, C and E that are present in tomatoes, work against free radicals which are unstable molecules that can lead to cancer formation.. The cooking process enhances lycopene availability in tomatoes, thus making sauces and soups, and even using them in regular curries is excellent. Their hydration along with nutrients, also help protect skin health and strengthen immune function.4/7KaleThe cancer-fighting compounds found in kale include vitamins C and K, together with fiber, antioxidants, as well as vitamins C and K. The substance indole-3-carbinol present in kale, functions to support DNA repair, and aid in toxic chemical detoxification, just like broccoli. Research shows that eating this vegetable reduces the probability of developing prostate, colon, lung and breast cancers. The strong taste and firm texture of kale make it suitable for preparing salads, blending into smoothies and cooking into soups. Kale is an excellent source of calcium and iron, which benefits bone health while providing energy. Regular kale consumption supports digestive health, through its high content of dietary fiber.5/7CarrotsThe pigment beta-carotene found in carrots, allows the body to produce vitamin A after conversion. The antioxidant property of beta-carotene protects cells, by preventing damage and reduces cancer cell growth. The natural pesticide falcarinol present in carrots, has shown to decrease the risk of cervical cancer and other types of cancer. Your intake of protective compounds will increase when you consume carrots either raw, or cooked on a regular basis. Carrots serve two health benefits because they contain dietary fiber which helps digestion, and also supports gut health.6/7SpinachSpinach contains the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin, together with vitamins A, C and folate which are abundant in this leafy green vegetable. These nutrients defend the immune system while blocking DNA harm, to decrease cancer formation chances. Studies indicate that consuming spinach reduces the chance of developing cancers in the mouth, lungs, pancreas and stomach. The versatile nature of spinach allows it to become an easy addition for salads, omelets, smoothies and cooked meals. Spinach contains magnesium which serves as a vital component for muscle and nerve operation. The antioxidants present in this vegetable, assist in lowering chronic inflammation which contributes to cancer formation.7/7How do these vegetables helpThese vegetables possess mechanisms to fight cancer through different types of compounds.The antioxidants in vegetables eliminate dangerous free radicals which can initiate DNA damage that leads to cancer formation.Cruciferous vegetables contain glucosinolates that produce active compounds which both remove cancer-causing agents from the body, and trigger cancer cell destruction.The vitamins C, E and folate support both immune system health and the repair of damaged cells.The dietary fiber found in vegetables helps the digestive system stay healthy, and feeds beneficial bacteria that could impact cancer development.The regular consumption of different vegetables protects your body's natural defenses, which in turn decreases cancer risks throughout your lifetime.Sources:PVHommed – 5 Cancer Fighting Vegetables You Should Be EatingNational Cancer Institute – Cruciferous Vegetables and Cancer PreventionHealthline – 12 Breast Cancer-Fighting FoodsMoffitt Cancer Center – 10 Cancer-Fighting Foods You Should Be EatingMedical News Today – 12 Cancer-Fighting Foods to Add to Your DietMD Anderson – 36 Foods That Can Help Lower Your Cancer RiskWebMD – Cancer-Fighting Foods SlideshowDisclaimer: This article is informational only and not a substitute for medical adviceFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous10 Kerala-style veg sides to enjoy with rice or appamFood​'Coolie' star Shruti Haasan stuns in gorgeous saree looks​indiaAshika Padukone’s top 10 beautiful looksindia8 times Mrunal Thakur set the ramp on fireindia10 things to know before getting a Pomeranian as pet dogindiaBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Contestants' stunning outfits for the weekendindia10 books to boost emotional intelligence and inner strengthindiaAnushka Shetty's saree looks you'll must tryindia​8 animals that “play dead” better than actors​india Next123 Photostories  6 Vastu Paintings to Attract Positivity and Good Energy5 cool hill stations in Tamil Nadu that offer perfect weekend break5 vegetables that starve cancer​From Banyan to Kadamba: Trees that fulfill wishes and blessings​Why non-drinkers get fatty liver: 7 risk factors driving this liver crisis in teetotalers10 pant mistakes that instantly make you shorter (and what to wear instead)Kidney damage is silent, until it's permanent: 7 red flags you must not ignoreMagnesium: 10 natural sources and how to eat them for maximum absorption5 offbeat wildlife experiences in India beyond the tiger craze123lifestyle videos13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement16:34Life After 60: Why India's seniors are choosing community living04:34Control Your Senses, Gain Knowledge, Attain Peace: Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4.3906:37Cultural Clashes in Love: How To Make Your Relationship Work03:19Prayagraj MahaKumbh 2025 Readies For Millions: Massive Preparations Underway In Uttar Pradesh04:48Sadhguru Reveals The Truth About Black Magic And Your Photograph07:18BK Shivani On Forgiveness: Why It’s Essential For Inner Peace08:08How Bhairavi Sadhana Accelerates Your Path to Liberation: Sadhguru Speaks06:47Breakup Recovery: How To Not Wallow In Misery And Love Yourself03:20The Purifying Power of Yajna: Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4, Verse 3011:41How Dattatreya Accepted Parashuram as His Disciple – Sadhguru Reveals03:54Can Water Remember?
