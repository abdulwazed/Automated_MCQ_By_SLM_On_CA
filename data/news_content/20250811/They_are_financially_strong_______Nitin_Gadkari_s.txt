NEW DELHI: Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Sunday took a veiled attack at US President Donald Trump for his tariff policy, saying, "those who are doing 'dadagiri' are doing so because they are financially strong and have technology."While delivering a lecture at the Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT) in Nagpur, Gadkari said that India would remain guided by its culture despite becoming financially strong."If our export and economic growth rate increases, I don't think we will need to go to anyone. Those who are doing 'dadagiri' are doing so because they are financially strong and have technology," Gadkari said. "Today, if we become financially strong and also become ahead in technology, even after this, we will not bully anyone because this is not in our culture. Our culture teaches us that the welfare of the world is the most important," he added.Also Read: 'Rapid service': Donald Trump presses China to increase soybean imports to ease deficit; tariff deadline expiry loomsHis remarks came after the US president imposed a 50 per cent tariff on India.The BJP leader also highlighted the importance of innovation, "Today the solution to all the problems of the world is science, technology and knowledge. If we use these three things, then we will never have to bow down to the world. Research centres, IITs, and engineering colleges should conduct research with the country's needs in mind. There are different things in all districts, states and regions. We have to work keeping everyone in mind. If we do such work continuously, then the growth rate of our country's economy will increase up to three times."About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
