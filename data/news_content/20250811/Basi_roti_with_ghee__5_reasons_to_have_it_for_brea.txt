But what you eat first really shapes how your whole day feels, your energy, digestion, and even your mood. That’s where basi roti with ghee quietly shines. It’s basically leftover or slightly fermented whole wheat flatbread, which might not sound exciting, but it’s actually a smart way to cut down on food waste and save a few bucks. In places like UP and Bihar, folks often enjoy it with jaggery, a simple, comforting combo that’s part of everyday life. Add a generous smear of ghee, and it turns into a warm, satisfying breakfast that keeps you going through the busiest mornings. Practical, wholesome, and honestly pretty comforting, it’s a breakfast worth bringing back. Scroll down to discover five simple reasons why basi roti with ghee makes such a great breakfast.”    2/6Basi roti prevents wastage     Let’s be honest, throwing away food just doesn’t sit right with most of us. Basi roti is one of those things that often gets forgotten and tossed, but why waste it? Instead, turn those dry rotis into your new go-to breakfast. It’s an easy way to cut down on waste, save a bit of cash, and still enjoy a warm, comforting meal that actually fills you up. Plus, with everyone talking about being smarter with food these days, basi roti with ghee feels like a small but meaningful way to eat better and live a little kinder.     3/6Gut health gets a delicious boost    Fermented foods have been all the rage for gut health, and basi roti fits right in. That slight fermentation happening in basi roti actually promotes good bacteria in your gut, helping digestion and keeping things running smoothly. Then there’s ghee, which isn’t just tasty – it contains butyrate, a fatty acid known for soothing your digestive tract and reducing inflammation. Together, basi roti and ghee are like a gentle comfort for your gut first thing in the morning.    4/6Steady energy without the crash    If you’re sick of breakfasts that shoot your sugar up and then leave you crashing, basi roti is a total game changer. Since it’s made from whole wheat, it gives you slow, steady energy instead of that quick spike. And when you spread some ghee on top, those good fats help keep you full and focused for way longer. No more sneaking snacks by mid-morning or crashing hard. Just steady energy that stays with you, making it easier to power through your day without any sugar slump.    5/6Filling but easy on your stomach    Nobody wants to feel heavy or slow right after breakfast. Basi roti’s got plenty of fiber from the whole wheat, so it keeps you full without that annoying hunger creeping back too soon. Plus, since it’s a bit fermented, it’s easier on your stomach than fresh bread. Toss on a good spoonful of ghee, and it’s warm, comforting, and just the right amount of filling. It’s the kind of breakfast that just sits right with you and gives you steady energy to power through your morning without feeling wiped out.    6/6Quick and convenient     We all have mornings when time is not on our side. That’s where basi roti shines. Since it’s already made (just leftover from yesterday’s meal), all you need to do is warm it up, add on a generous dollop of ghee, and you’re set. No fancy prep, no complicated recipes. This simple breakfast is perfect for anyone juggling a packed schedule but refusing to sacrifice nutrition.Follow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousHow to make natural hair colour using tea and coffeeindiaDivyanka Tripathi’s top 10 stylish must-have looksindia​How to make dhaba-style Egg Curry at home​Food9 heart-healthy foods that cut attack and stroke riskindiaSaniya Iyappan steals the spotlight with her graceindiaCarrie Coon’s secret weapon on TV?
