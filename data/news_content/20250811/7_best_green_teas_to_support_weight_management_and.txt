Green tea contains powerful compounds like catechins and polyphenols that help protect against chronic diseases and improve brain function. Various types of green tea, such as matcha, sencha, and hojicha, each provide unique flavours and health advantages. Incorporating green tea into your daily routine can enhance energy levels, support heart health, and aid digestion, making it a valuable addition to a balanced diet.From matcha to sencha: Green teas for better healthGreen tea is made from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant.
