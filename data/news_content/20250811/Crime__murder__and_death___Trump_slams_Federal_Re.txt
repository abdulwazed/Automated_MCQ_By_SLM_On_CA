He aims to eradicate crime, homelessness, and improve the capital's physical condition, establishing a task force for safety and beauty. Trump pledges to remove homeless individuals and incarcerate criminals, promising swift action and comparing it to border enforcement success.  US President Donald Trump on Sunday blasted the Federal Reserve’s ongoing headquarters renovations, ahead of a Monday press conference where he plans to address “crime and the beautification” of Washington, D.C. The event is set to address the eradication of "Crime, Murder and Death" in the nation’s capital. It will also focus on "Cleanliness and the General Physical Renovation and Condition of our once beautiful and well-maintained Capital." In his post, Trump criticised the expenditure on the renovation of the Federal Reserve building in Washington, D.C. He said, "We are not going to allow people to spend Rs 25,730 crore on fixing up a building, like the Federal Reserve, which could have been done in a far more elegant and time sensitive manner for Rs 416 to 833 crore." He added, "The Renovation would have actually been better, and would have saved Rs 248 crore, Traffic James and never-ending Construction."Trump's remark came after two 15-year-old boys were arrested on Monday in Washington, D.C., for unarmed carjacking and assaulting former Department of Govt Efficiency staffer Edward Coristine, also known as “Big Balls.”The arrests prompted federal law enforcement to increase patrols across the city. President Trump has mentioned the idea of federalising the city to combat excessive crime, despite crime rates in the nation’s capital being at a 30-year low.In response to the incident, he signed an executive order establishing a task force dedicated to making D.C. “safe and beautiful.”Earlier, on Sunday, Trump pledged to remove all homeless individuals from the capital and incarcerate criminals in an effort to “take our Capital back,” citing a significant rise in crime.In a post on his Truth Social account, Trump stated, “We want our Capital BACK. The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY. We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don't have to move out. We're going to put you in jail where you belong.” He further added, “This will be easier — Be prepared! There will be no ‘MR. NICE GUY,’” noting that more details would be revealed at a news conference on Monday. “It's all going to happen very fast, just like the Border. We went from millions pouring in, to ZERO in the last few months,” he added, referring to the crackdown by immigration and customs enforcements on illegal immigrants in the nation.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
