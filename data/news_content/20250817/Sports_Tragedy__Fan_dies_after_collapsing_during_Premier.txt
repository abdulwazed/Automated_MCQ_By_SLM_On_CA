While the gentleman concerned is foremost in our minds, we are also aware that it was an emotional and distressing situation for staff and supporters in the direct vicinity. Over the coming days we will ensure those affected are properly supported.” Club doctor and emergency medicine consultant Dr Rob Galloway also addressed the tragedy. He said, “Firstly, I would like to convey my condolences and sympathies to the gentleman’s family and friends. It was a tragic outcome, but from an emergency response perspective, the medical care was exemplary, and the professionalism of club stewards and Sussex Police provided the medical team with the best possible working environment.” Officials explained why play was not halted during the incident.
