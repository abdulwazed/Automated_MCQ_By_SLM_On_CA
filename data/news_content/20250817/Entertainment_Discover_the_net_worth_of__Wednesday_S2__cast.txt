While Jenna Ortega's portrayal of Wednesday Addams has garnered significant attention, Catherine Zeta-Jones, as Morticia Addams, holds the highest net worth at USD 150 million. The season premiered in August 2025, with the concluding episodes set to release in September.  The gothic drama, ‘Wednesday,’ has taken over the playlists, social media, and gossip sessions with the highly anticipated Season 2 – and the fans can’t get enough of it. While the cast members played their same characters this season as well, their net worths have a stark difference. Here’s a closer look at the net worth of the ‘Wednesday’ star cast, with one person holding the crown of being the richest – and it’s not Jenna Ortega.Hunter Doohan (Tyler Gaplin)From being a boy-next-door barista to a sinister monster, Hunter Doohan copiously played the role of Tyler Gaplin in ‘Wednesday.’ He earned his way up by working in numerous short films and minor roles in television roles such as ‘What If’ and ‘Westworld.’ Taking a significant leap, the 31-year-old recently joined Marvel for the ‘Daredevil: Born Again’ series, and worked in prominent dramas such as ‘Truth Be Told’ and ‘Your Honor.’ Holding an estimated net worth of USD 400,000, Doohan created a stunning impact in ‘Wednesday Season 2,' according to The Richest.Jenna Ortega (Wednesday Addams)The modern Wednesday Addams screams ancestral trauma and goth, and Jenna Ortega played the titular role quite commendably. She gained recognition by playing minor characters in ‘Jane the Virgin’ and ‘You.’ After her breakout in season 1, the 22-year-old played the lead roles in feature films, including ‘Miller’s Girl,’ ‘Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,’ and ‘Hurry Up Tomorrow.’ Holding an estimated net worth of USD 5 million, Ortega’s character brought the horror back to Nevermore Academy. Billie Piper (Isadora Capri)Billie Piper brought Isadora Capri to life with her successful music career and talented artistic instincts. Playing the role of the school’s new Head of Music, she added just the drama needed in the supernatural series. The 42-year-old rose to fame after her role in ‘Doctor Who,’ leading to even more success as the lead role in ‘I Hate Suzie’ and ‘Penny Dreadful.’ Holding an estimated net worth of USD 12 million, Piper helmed her dual expertise to triumph. Luiz Guzman (Gomez Addams)Luiz Guzman, playing the iconic role of Gomez Addams, returned to ‘Wednesday Season 2’ with an even darker narrative and challenging devotion. He has been in the industry for four decades, achieving a new peak of success with each project. The 68-year-old’s prominent and memorable showbiz includes ‘Narcos,’ ‘Code Black,’ ‘Out of Sight,’ and many more. Holding an estimated net worth of USD 13 million, Guzman gave a new form of yearning in the new season.Steve Buscemi (Barry Dot)The new principal, Barry Dot, played by none other than Steve Buscemi, added all the deserving twists and energy in ‘Wednesday.’ He is renowned for playing characters with unprecedented future and actions throughout the course. After being in the entertainment industry for four decades, the 67-year-old went from being a firefighter to a full-time actor. Buscemi earned recognition after his role in ‘Reservoir Dogs,’ leading to further success in feature films, including ‘The Death of Stalin,’ ‘Fargo,’ ‘Ghost World,’ and many more. Holding an estimated net worth of USD 35 million, Buscemi brought a certain new light to the darker mix in the new season. Catherine Zeta-Jones (Morticia Addams)Catherine Zeta-Jones, in the stunning attire of Morticia Addams, casually turned dread into a romantic emotion. The actress is renowned for turning people’s heads in the industry, and she continues to do so with her innate charm. The 55-year-old’s significant projects include ‘No Reservations,’ ‘Ocean’s Twelve,’ ‘The Terminal,’ and many more. Holding the crown of being the richest cast member, Catherine Zeta-Jones has an estimated net worth of USD 150 million. ‘Wednesday Season 2: Part 1’ was released on August 2, 2025, on Netflix, and the defining two episodes under ‘Part 2’ would be released on September 3, 2025.
