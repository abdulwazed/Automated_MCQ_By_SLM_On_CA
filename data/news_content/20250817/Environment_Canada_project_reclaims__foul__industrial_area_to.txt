The Port Lands never thrived as an industrial area, leaving a vast stretch of eastern downtown under-used, and the Don River became polluted. "It was really dirty, it was foul, it was terrible," Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow said recently. - Hurricane Hazel -On October 15, 1954 Hurricane Hazel hit Toronto, after hammering parts of the Caribbean and eastern United States.It killed 81 people across the Greater Toronto Area and served as catalyst for the city to get serious about flood protection. Hazel flooded the Humber River, in western Toronto, but Glaisek said "it was understood at the time that that same amount of rainfall, had it landed on the (eastern) Don, would have done a comparable amount of damage." He called Hazel an initial "impetus" to re-naturalize the Port Lands, but rising awareness over the past two decades about the causal link between climate change and extreme floods helped advance the project. - 'Duty bound' -To reclaim the Port Lands, Toronto partnered with the US-based landscape architecture firm Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, which has worked on the Brooklyn Bridge Park and the Obama Presidential Center in Chicago.Laura Solano, the lead designer, said the project was "duty bound to address catastrophic flooding," but stressed it offered "much more."Because the area has been reformed to cope with flood waters, parts have been declared safe for new housing -- an urgent need in the expensive metropolis.There is also a new park, trails and people can canoe or kayak through the rehabilitated Don.Solano stressed Toronto's initial decision to alter the area was consistent with the times, when North American cities moved to "industrialize their waters...to raise their economic position."But now, "every city is looking to reclaim their waters," she told AFP. The Port Lands "shows the world that it's possible to fix the past and turn deficit and remnant industrial lands into living and breathing infrastructure."- 'The river is going to flood' -As Glaisek described the project, he stood on a bank that would, by design, be under water during a major storm."It's all planned so that it can flood, the water level can rise, the river can get about three, maybe four times wider than it is now, absorb all of that volume of water," he said. "When the storm event subsides, it will shrink back down to this."It's a planning approach that recognizes "we're seeing more and more of these events.""Like in Texas, you see very tragic outcomes when you haven't really tried to plan for nature," he told AFP, referring to flash floods in early July that killed at least 135 people. He urged planners to "reposition" their relationship to nature and ditch the mindset that "humans (can) control everything.""Let's acknowledge the river is going to flood. Let's build the space for it." bs/desEnd of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousWhen Mrunal Thakur wore the most wedding-worthy Banarasi sareeLifestyle10 Indian baby names inspired by Indian languages and scriptsLifestyle10 interesting facts about Kiran Desai and her Booker Prize 2025 longlisted bookLifestyleShobha Shetty’s top 10 half-saree lookstv8 air-purifying plants for your homeLifestyleIn pics: Glamorous looks of actress Bindhu MadhavitvTake cues from Rashmika Mandanna's traditional attires this ShravanEntertainmentKnow the pros and cons of using derma rollers for faster hair growthLifestyleSai Pallavi and her love for eyelinersEntertainment10 most-friendly animals in India!Lifestyle Next123 Photostories  Priyanka Chopra said NO to these 5 hit films - Guess who got them insteadBehind the villain’s mask, Ranjeet’s real story will surprise you5 miracle oils that can actually help grow hair on bald patchesKidney vs Gallbladder stones: What's the difference and 5 very early symptoms you shouldn’t ignoreWhy are Guppy and Swordtail fish ideal starter options for new aquarists5 Friendship Day-perfect destinations in India to reconnect with your old buddiesGrow these 5 vegetables in pots – No backyard neededNo bad time to travel: 7 Indian destinations that are great year-roundTop 5 foods for muscle recoveryTrain the brain to love discipline: 7 habits that can help123Hot PicksMeteor ShowersOperation MahadevP&G CEOIndia US TradeLenskart IPOTCS share priceJulia HymanTop TrendingTaylor SwiftNBA Trade RumorsNazem KadriJarred VanderbiltBoeing 787 DreamlinerYankee Stadium Viral videoDeandre AytonVanessa BryantIndia US Trade AgreementNHL Trade RumorsTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteLondon airspace shut: All outbound UK flights hit by air traffic control 'technical issue'Saudi Arabia’s EV maker, Lucid, breaks world record with 1,205 km drive across Europe in single chargeSaikat Chakrabarti vs Nancy Pelosi: Meet Indian-American challenging Godmother of Dem Party — in her own backyardExplained: Why a Russian earthquake triggered tsunami alerts in Hawaii, Japan, and the US West CoastUAE: Will influencers need an advertiser permit to post on social media?
