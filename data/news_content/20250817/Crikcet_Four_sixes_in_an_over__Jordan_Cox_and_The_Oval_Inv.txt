The right-hander blasted 86 not out from just 29 deliveries, including 10 sixes, which equaled the competition’s individual record set by Liam Livingstone. His most spectacular moment came in the 11th over against Ajeet Singh Dale, where he hit him for 26 runs.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Cox launched the first three balls for consecutive sixes, over long-on, deep mid-wicket, and again over mid-wicket respectively, before a wide and a dot briefly halted the charge. He finished the set in style, reversing his stance to scoop a full toss over short fine leg, a shot that had the crowd on its feet. Cox’s merciless attack, a rapid opening partnership of 76 between Tawanda Muyeye and Will Jacks, Sam Curran adding 34 in a 97-run partnership with the star of the night all meant that the Invincibles set multiple records in the process. In total, they cleared the ropes 17 times, the most ever in a Hundred innings. Remarkably, Cox had managed only eight runs from his first eight balls before starting to fire on all cylinders. Welsh Fire never recovered in the chase. Jason Behrendorff struck with his first delivery, and Cox added a highlight in the field by sprinting back from mid-on to dismiss Steve Smith. Some resistance came in the form of Jonny Bairstow, whose 50 off 28 balls helped, but Tom Curran’s 4/15 wrapped up the innings for 143 in 93 balls.PollWhat aspect of Jordan Cox's innings impressed you the most?The number of sixes he hitHis strike rate of 296.55The variety of shots played The margin of defeat was the third largest in the competition’s history.
