The Ministry of Justice now handles all judicial translation requests digitally through the e-Litigation platform, improving speed and accuracy/ Image: File The Ministry of Justice in Saudi Arabia has formally launched a centralized translation service through its e-Litigation platform, streamlining all judicial translation processes to support efficient legal communication and case handling.A system-wide overhaul of judicial translation services The Unified Translation Center is now operational on the e-Litigation platform, enabling centralized management of judicial translation requests. The service encompasses the entire translation process, from the initial request by a beneficiary to completion, within a single digital workflow. The platform automates the receipt of translation requests, which can originate from lawsuits or judicial departments, and coordinates their assignment to translators. It also provides tools for monitoring and supervision, ensuring the status of each request can be tracked throughout its lifecycle. The integration allows beneficiaries, such as litigants, legal representatives, and courts, to follow the progress of their translation requests step-by-step, aiming to improve the quality, speed, and efficiency of translation services within judicial procedures.Addressing language barriers in Saudi courts The Unified Translation Center, under the Ministry of Justice, offers remote interpretation services for non-Arabic speakers during court hearings. By utilizing videoconferencing and the e-Litigation system, interpreters, including those specializing in sign language, can assist in real time, ensuring accurate understanding between judicial panels and individuals involved in legal proceedings who do not speak Arabic. This initiative was launched with a clear goal: to eliminate communication barriers in courtrooms and legal environments, providing transparent interpretation to safeguard due process and individual rights. It emphasizes accuracy and ensures that non-Arabic speakers are given full clarity and participation during legal procedures.Platform access through Najiz The Najiz platform, which serves as the Ministry of Justice’s unified digital services portal, hosts the translation functionality. In August 2023, the Ministry introduced a dedicated feature on Najiz titled “Request for an Interpreter”. This allows non-Arabic speaking users to request translation services directly online. Najiz is part of a broader effort by the Ministry to provide comprehensive judicial services digitally, aimed at improving user experience and service accessibility.Institutional context and evolution The Ministry of Justice is one of the most longstanding government entities in Saudi Arabia. Established by Royal Order in 1962, the Ministry was tasked with overseeing all courts and fulfilling their administrative and financial needs. Although it was founded in 1962, the Ministry began executing its formal duties in 1970 under the leadership of the first appointed Minister of Justice, Mohammed Bin Ali al-Harkhan, who served until 1975. Among all ministries under the Council of Ministers, the Ministry of Justice is one of only three that has never undergone a name change, merger, or dissolution, the others being the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Health. The Ministry is headquartered in Riyadh and is managed by a Minister appointed via Royal Order, who also holds membership in the Council of Ministers.Vision 2030 and strategic justice reforms The broader modernization of judicial services, including digital translation and litigation processes, is aligned with the national transformation program Saudi Vision 2030. The Ministry’s active reform phase began after the first meeting of the Council of Economic and Development Affairs in 2016, where His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, Crown Prince and Prime Minister, launched the Vision. As part of this alignment, the Ministry of Justice adopted thirteen strategic goals, all contributing to systemic improvements across its various sectors. These sectors include:  Judiciary   Enforcement   Documentation   Reconciliation   Advocacy   Judicial Training Center   Each plays a role in transforming legal services to be more efficient, accessible, and aligned with global standards.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
