The letter was hand-delivered to the Russian leader by US President Donald Trump ahead of his summit with Putin at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska on Friday, according to Fox News.First lady’s message emphasized the war’s devastating effect on children, describing them as “caught in the crosshairs” of the violence.Her letter began with “Dear President Putin, Every child shares the same quiet dreams in their heart, whether born randomly into a nation’s rustic countryside or a magnificent city-center. They dream of love, possibility, and safety from danger.”“As parents, it is our duty to nurture the next generation’s hope. As leaders, the responsibility to sustain our children extends beyond the comfort of a few”, Melania wrote.letterThe letter marked the first lady’s second involvement in foreign affairs with the Eastern European power. Melania played a role in convincing her husband to increase military aid to Ukraine and adopt a tougher stance on Russia in dealings related to the protracted war.Calling children “a purity, an innocence which stands above geography, government, and ideology,” Mrs. Trump urged Putin to act. “Mr. Putin, you can singlehandedly restore their melodic laughter,” she wrote. “In protecting the innocence of these children, you will do more than serve Russia alone, you serve humanity itself.”The letter concluded with a time-bound note to act on the current situation. “Such a bold idea transcends all human division, and you, Mr. Putin, are fit to implement this vision with a stroke of the pen today. It is time.”The letter was presented to Putin just before the Alaska summit.Trump described the Alaska meeting as “extremely productive,” while clarifying that no formal agreement was reached. Both leaders gave positive accounts of the meeting, though no signed deal emerged. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to travel to Washington DC on Monday to meet President Trump.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
