Marsh, who struck 54 off 37 balls with three fours and five sixes, targeted the deep square-leg boundary with telling effect. But South Africa clawed their way back into the contest, picking three wickets in the space of 13 balls around the halfway mark. Just when the visitors sensed an opening, Maxwell took charge to tilt the balance decisively.Speaking after receiving the Player of the Match award, Maxwell credited his calm approach. “Corbin bowled a brilliant over. Nice to get over the line. I just stayed calm, watched the ball, and understood where to find the boundaries. We’ve had a great run with this T20 group. It’s great for our confidence — we’re building something nice,” he said.Tim David, named Player of the Series, was quick to acknowledge Maxwell’s brilliance: “Without Maxi playing a blinder here, I wouldn’t have been standing here. I’m just enjoying going out there and competing. Keeping it simple, not trying too hard. Form comes and goes.”Australia’s recent form in T20Is now makes for imposing reading: series wins over Scotland, Pakistan, West Indies, and South Africa, alongside a drawn series in England. With Maxwell back in full flight, the Aussies look every bit the force heading into a packed white-ball calendar.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
