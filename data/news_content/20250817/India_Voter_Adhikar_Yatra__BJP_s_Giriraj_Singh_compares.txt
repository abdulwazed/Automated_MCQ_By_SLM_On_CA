On the occasion of Janmashtami, I would say that Krishna destroyed Kans. There are some Kans here too, and on the occasion of Janmashtami, their destruction is certain,” Singh said.Echoing similar criticism, BJP MP Praveen Khandelwal alleged that Congress’s outreach was based on falsehoods. “The narrative that Rahul Gandhi is trying to create is based on a foundation of lies. In this regard, the people of Bihar recognise that this is primarily a journey to regain Congress's lost ground in the state. This is a journey that every single person knows about. This journey is being undertaken for political gains. It has no concern for the public,” he was quoted as saying by ANI.The ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’ has been launched against the Election Commission’s Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the voter list in Bihar and the opposition’s charge of “vote theft.” Bihar leader of opposition Tejashwi Yadav said the initiative aimed to spread awareness among those whose names had been excluded from the electoral rolls. “We are starting the ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’ from Sasaram. We will visit several districts, and our effort will be to make people aware so that no voter's name is left out. We also fought and got a relief from the Supreme Court in this matter, whether it is the Supreme Court direction to the Election Commission of India to publish the list of 65 lakh persons excluded or deleted from the Bihar draft electoral voters list, along with the reasons,” he said.Calling the campaign a “historical journey,” Yadav expressed confidence that the Mahagathbandhan would receive strong public backing. “Rahul Gandhi and other leaders of the Mahagathbandhan will go among the people and make them aware of voter rights. Along with this, we will also raise the local issues. We will also convey what our vision would be if we form our government. This is going to be a historical journey, and we will get the blessings of the Bihar voters,” he said, as per ANI.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
