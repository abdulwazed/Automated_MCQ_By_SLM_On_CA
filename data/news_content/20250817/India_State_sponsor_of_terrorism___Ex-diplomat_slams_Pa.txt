She warned India must remain vigilant, echoing PM Modi's stance that any terror act will be considered an act of war. Representative image NEW DELHI: Former diplomat Veena Sikri has strongly criticised Pakistan for honouring terrorists during its Independence Day events, calling it yet another example of Islamabad’s deep-rooted support for terror groups. Speaking to news agency ANI, Sikri described Pakistan as a “terror monger” state and warned that India must remain alert.“We have always said that Pakistan is a state sponsor of terrorism. It is a matter of great concern to India. And our Prime Minister has now declared the new normal that every act of terror will be considered an act of war. So this is a big warning to Pakistan,” Sikri was quoted as saying by ANI. She cautioned that Islamabad must not allow its army or groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba to operate, stressing that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s words amount to a “huge warning” against any further misadventure."So I hope they will heed that warning. What they did on their own Independence Day on 14th August just proves the point. They have always been supporting terrorism. They have always been supporting terrorist groups, giving them money," she said.Sikri also alleged that Pakistan was using International Monetary Fund (IMF) funds to rebuild infrastructure destroyed during India’s Operation Sindoor. “They are now offered to build all their buildings which were destroyed during the Operation Sindoor with government money. So all the money going from the IMF is going for this purpose. It is terrible, and the world should take note of that,” she said.In his Independence Day address, Prime Minister Modi hailed the success of Operation Sindoor and saluted the armed forces for striking terror camps in Pakistan. He recalled the Pahalgam attack in Jammu and Kashmir where “husbands were killed in front of their wives and fathers were killed in front of their children after asking their religion,” saying the operation was India’s answer to such brutality. “Our brave jawans punished the enemy beyond its imagination,” PM Modi said from the Red Fort.The Prime Minister also underlined that Operation Sindoor had inflicted “heavy losses” on Pakistan and marked a new phase in India’s fight against cross-border terrorism. Rejecting Islamabad’s “nuclear blackmail,” he reaffirmed that India would retaliate decisively against any future attacks. PM Modi further criticised the Indus Water Treaty, calling it “unjust and one-sided,” and declared that “blood and water cannot flow together,” promising India’s farmers full rights over the country’s river waters.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
