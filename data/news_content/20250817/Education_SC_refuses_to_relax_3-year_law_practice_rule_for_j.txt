A Madhya Pradesh judge had sought recognition of judicial officers’ experience, but the bench led by CJI B R Gavai said allowing it would “open Pandora’s box,” dismissing the plea.  The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to modify its verdict mandating a minimum three-year law practice criterion for law graduates to appear in entry-level judicial services examinations, saying any relaxation would open a “Pandora's box.” The top court was hearing a plea filed by a judge from Madhya Pradesh seeking a modification of the verdict to allow serving judicial officers to take the exam by considering their judicial experience. On May 20, a bench headed by Chief Justice B R Gavai barred fresh law graduates from appearing in entry-level judicial services examinations and fixed a minimum three-year law practice requirement. The verdict said candidates must practice law for at least three years before becoming eligible to take the judicial services exam. The court had agreed to consider the three-year experience of law graduates as law interns but refused to recognise the experience of serving as a judicial officer for the same purpose. On Thursday, the bench comprising the CJI and Justice K Vinod Chandran once again declined to reconsider the issue, ruling out allowing judicial officers to appear in fresh exams in other states. “What is wrong in Madhya Pradesh we will not modify this. This will open Pandora's box,” the CJI said while dismissing the plea. PTIReady to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future.
