The LAUSD is responding by increasing security around schools. Cruz's teammates and community members are rallying to support him and his family, highlighting his positive character and the impact of his absence.  A Los Angeles high school senior was taken into custody by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents last week, allegedly leaving his dog loose on the street during the arrest. The student, identified as 18-year-old Benjamin Marcelo Guerrero Cruz, was detained in Van Nuys on Friday, August 8, according to Newsweek citing GoFundMe campaign created on his behalf.'American Nightmare': Anti-ICE Protests Rock NYC Federal Plaza; Arrests Amid Trump DeportationsGuerrero-Cruz helps take care of his 5-month-old twin brothers and his 6-year-old brother, the GoFundMe post said. He's described in the post as a "devoted son, a caring brother, a loyal friend, and a valued member of our community," ABC news reported. The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) confirmed the incident and its spokesperson said, "Los Angeles Unified stands united in protecting every student and family during this period of heightened immigration enforcement.""Working closely with city leaders and municipal partners, we have strengthened safety measures at and around our schools. This includes enhanced communication with various entities, visible presence in impacted communities, and rapid-response protocols should enforcement activity occur."  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) told KTLA that Cruz had overstayed his visa by more than two years, with his visa waiver programme expiring in March 2023. Cruz is currently held in ICE detention in LA. As of Friday morning, over Rs 24,000 had been raised to cover his legal fees and basic needs for his mother and siblings, who also live in fear of federal agents. Friends have expressed support for Cruz, with his soccer teammates describing him as reliable, respectful, and kind. The arrest coincided with the temporary detention of a 15-year-old student with disabilities elsewhere in LA on Monday morning. In response, LAUSD is deploying staff and school police to patrol streets around 100 schools to protect students from ICE and other agents. At a news conference on Thursday, LAUSD Superintendent Alberto Carvalho stated, "He is 18 years old, but he's a kid. He has not been exposed to anything in his life. He drinks water once a day. The food is insufficient. Mom said that there was not enough room for everybody to sit or lie down at the same time." Ronny C, a soccer teammate of Cruz, said on the GoFundMe page, "We're devastated to lose such a good kid and great teammate. On the field, he was rock-solid—always showed up, worked hard, and could be counted on week after week. Off the field, he was just as reliable: kind, respectful, and someone who lifted up the people around him. He brought consistency, heart, and a quiet strength that made the team better in every way. It's heartbreaking to see him taken from us like this, and we'll truly miss not just the player, but the person he was." The standoff between LA officials, including Mayor Karen Bass, and the Trump administration continues, with the President stating that ICE has full authority to arrest and detain individuals in sanctuary cities suspected of being illegally present in the U.S.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
