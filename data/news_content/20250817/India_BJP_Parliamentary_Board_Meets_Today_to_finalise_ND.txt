Prime Minister Modi and key leaders will decide, with RSS endorsement expected. Potential candidates include Acharya Devvrat and Thawarchand Gehlot, balancing caste dynamics. PM Narendra Modi and others (agencies)  NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Parliamentary Board is set to convene on Sunday at the party headquarters in New Delhi to finalize the National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA) candidate for the upcoming Vice-Presidential election, scheduled for September 9. The meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will include key leaders such as Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, and BJP President J.P. Nadda, among others. The NDA has authorized Modi and Nadda to select the candidate for this critical constitutional post, with the decision expected to be endorsed by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).The urgency to select a candidate follows the abrupt resignation of former Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar on July 21, 2025, citing health reasons, though speculations of political differences had surfaced. Sources indicate that the BJP is keen on choosing a candidate deeply rooted in the BJP-RSS ecosystem, with names like Gujarat Governor Acharya Devvrat, Karnataka Governor Thawarchand Gehlot, Sikkim Governor Om Mathur, and Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha being considered. Devvrat, a Jat community member, is a strong contender to appease the community, while Gehlot’s selection could bolster the BJP’s outreach to backward caste voters.The NDA, with its majority in the electoral college comprising Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha members, is poised for an easy victory if the election is contested. The opposition INDIA bloc may field a candidate, with discussions slated for August 18. Meanwhile, all NDA Chief Ministers and Deputy Chief Ministers have been summoned to Delhi on August 21 for the nomination filing, signaling a unified front. The decision on Sunday is expected to reflect strategic political calculations, balancing caste dynamics and RSS influence.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousSamyuktha’s style story: From chic glam to royal eleganceEntertainmentSalmonella isn’t just in chicken: Surprising foods that can make you sickLifestyleFrom Preity Mukundhan to Keerthy Suresh: South actresses' best pictures of the weekEntertainmentHiba Nawab’s stylish and chic lookstvAttractive looks of Megha AkashEntertainmentVarshini Sounderajan’s top 10 gorgeous lookstvTop 10 traditional looks of Bigg Boss fame Siri Hanumanthutv9 simple habits that can help you live longerLifestyle8 books for building self-confidence & self-worthLifestyleThe world's fastest killers: 10 animals that cause death in secondsLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Why do we place Kalash in puja ritualsKidney damage and high BP: Why blood pressure and kidneys are more connected than you thinkFrom managing blood pressure to tackling ‘bad’ cholesterol, 7 teas that are liquid wondersLove in words: Romantic quotes that aren’t cheesy6 Indian snacks you can make entirely in an air fryer10 gender-neutral baby names popular in the US10 kid-friendly destinations in India for that perfect family break7 fashion tips from Jennifer Aniston's iconic character Rachel Green5 saree lessons to steal from the ever-so-graceful Vidya Balan7 fabulous looks inspired by Emma Thompson123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingLinkedin Announces ListJosh Allen WifeCiaraMichael PorterAztee Egg in Adopt MeShannon SharpeLeanna LeneeAntonio BrownPatrick MahomesTaylor SwiftTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteSave Delhi-NCR strays: When RSS chief & Rahul Gandhi speak in unison for the voiceless‘Torrents of muddy water’: Video shows Kullu flash floods; NH blocked, restoration under wayAnother cloudburst hits J&K: Heavy rain lashes Kathua village; 4 killed, six injuredBJP Parliamentary Board Meets Today to finalise NDA’s Vice-Presidential Candidate'Crossed all limits of shamelessness': Congress questions EC over refusal to share machine-readable rolls; poll body says parties failed to flag errors on time'State sponsor of terrorism': Ex-diplomat slams Pakistan; says Islamabad glorifying terrorists on I-DayFlash floods hit Himachal: Highway blocked with fresh landslide; Mandi, Kullu, Kinnaur worst hit as continuous rain hampers restoration effortsPMO may shift in Sept from South Block to Executive Enclave-I₹34k cr in e-challans yet to be paid by violators11 killed, 36 injured in bus crash in Bengal'When you learn to drive on Indian roads': Truck driver takes wrong U-turn, kills 3 in FloridaWho is Brian O’Kelley?
