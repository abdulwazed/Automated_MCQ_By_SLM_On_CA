While a filet mignon lunch was scrapped, the summit shifted focus from a ceasefire to a broader peace deal. Zelensky's upcoming White House visit will address Putin's proposal for Ukraine to cede territory in exchange for international peacekeepers.  Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump held a nearly three-hour closed-door meeting in Alaska, which produced no concrete deal but went beyond a mere conversation on a Ukraine peace agreement.An eight-page document, accidentally left in a hotel printer ahead of the high-profile Ukraine peace talks, offered a glimpse into the planned meeting between the two presidents, New York Post reported.The page contained details such as President Trump’s planned gift for Vladimir Putin and the lunch menu for their summit. The leak, first reported by NPR, went viral after guests at the Hotel Captain Cook discovered the printouts in a public printer. While the material revealed little sensitive security information — most of the summit agenda at Joint Base Elmendorf–Richardson was already public — it did include some quirky details. Among them, a planned filet mignon lunch with champagne vinaigrette salad that was later scrapped, a seating chart with Trump and Putin at the center, and a pronunciation note instructing aides to say the Russian leader’s name as “POO-tihn.” Another page revealed Trump intended to gift Putin a bald eagle desk statue, along with phone numbers of advance staff. Most of the listed events were either altered or abandoned after Trump shifted his focus from an immediate ceasefire to pursuing a broader peace deal. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to visit the White House on Monday, where discussions are expected to center on Putin’s proposal that Ukraine cede remaining parts of Donetsk in exchange for an international peacekeeping force, including British and French troops, to deter further Russian aggression.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
