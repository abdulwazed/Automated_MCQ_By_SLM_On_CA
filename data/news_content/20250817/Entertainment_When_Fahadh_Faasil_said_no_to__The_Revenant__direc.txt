(Picture Courtesy: Facebook) Fahadh Faasil, one of Malayalam cinema’s most celebrated actors, recently revealed that he once had the chance to work in a film directed by Academy Award-winning filmmaker Alejandro González Iñárritu. Known for masterpieces like 'Birdman' and 'The Revenant', Iñárritu had even connected with Fahadh over a video call. Yet, despite the enormity of the opportunity, Fahadh chose to let it go and here's the reason why.Why he declined the offerIn an interview with Cue Studio during the promotions of his latest film 'Oduṁ Kuthira Chadum Kuthira', Fahadh shared that the reason he turned down the role was his accent. “What didn’t work for him was my accent. To fix that, he said I would need to stay in the US for about four months, during which there would be no payment. That’s why I let go of the opportunity,” he admitted. Fahadh added that while many actors would have grabbed the chance, he didn’t feel the fire to put in so much effort only for the sake of altering his speech.The
