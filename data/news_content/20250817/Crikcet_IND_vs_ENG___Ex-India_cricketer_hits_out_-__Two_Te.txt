(PTI Photo/R Senthilkumar)(PTI07_26_2025_000207B) Former India batter Sanjay Manjrekar has joined the bandwagon of ex-cricketers criticising Indian spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, who played only three Tests in the recently concluded Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy."The game will always show us the mirror however much we try and gloss over things," Manjrekar wrote in his column for HT.IND vs ENG: Shubman Gill on Oval thriller, Siraj's spell, and missing Rishabh Pant and Jasprit BumrahGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"It was poetic justice that the two Tests India won were the two matches Bumrah did not play."This should embolden the Indian selectors to make some hard choices when it comes to big-name players."This series has been a great lesson to them and to us too. The two Test victories India achieved did not feature Virat (Kohli), (Cheteshwar) Pujara, Rohit (Sharma), (Mohammed) Shami or Bumrah!"It reminded us of the eternal truth of sport and life — no one, however great, is indispensable.
