The nature of e-challans issued across states show that while 81% of them were for violation of traffic rules, the remaining 19% concerned flouting of transport-related norms. In a written reply to a Parliament question, the road transport ministry has said that till July 27, around Rs 20,000 crore (out of the total Rs 54,360 crore) has been collected as fines against the e-challans issued.Police and transport departments in just five states - Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Haryana and Delhi - have issued over 20 crore challans to violators, more than 50% of all challans issued across the country."This indicates that e-challaning is yet to pick up across several states. There has been a significant increase in electronic enforcement in the past couple of years as more cities are going for CCTV surveillance. Also, there is now a focus on ensuring that due procedures are followed by law enforcement agencies while issuing challans," said a govt official. In fact, data show that while in the past one year, around 9.2 crore e-challans were issued across states and UTs with a cumulative penalty of Rs 16,662 crore, the enforcement agencies recovered only Rs 3,447 crore from violators.Considering the high pendency of e-challans on account of several factor, the road transport ministry has issued a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to states and UTs specifying the norms to be followed.High pendency of E-challans* Total challans issued since jan 2015: 36.2 cr* Total challan amount: Rs 54,360 cr* Challans disposed of: 13.8 cr* Revenue collected: Rs 20,152 cr* Challans sent to court: 9.9 cr* Challans disposed of in courts: 1.5 crTop 5 states (booked challans)Tamil Nadu: 7.3 crUttar Pradesh: 7.1 crKerala: 3.6 crHaryana: 1.8 crDelhi: 1.4 crEnd of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJasmin Bhasin’s inspired top 10 glamorous lookstvSamyuktha’s style story: From chic glam to royal eleganceEntertainmentSalmonella isn’t just in chicken: Surprising foods that can make you sickLifestyleFrom Preity Mukundhan to Keerthy Suresh: South actresses' best pictures of the weekEntertainmentHiba Nawab’s stylish and chic lookstvAttractive looks of Megha AkashEntertainmentVarshini Sounderajan’s top 10 gorgeous lookstvTop 10 traditional looks of Bigg Boss fame Siri Hanumanthutv9 simple habits that can help you live longerLifestyle8 books for building self-confidence & self-worthLifestyle Next123 Photostories  The ultimate 4 P formula for continued successWhen leading ladies said no to big rolesWhy do we place Kalash in puja ritualsKidney damage and high BP: Why blood pressure and kidneys are more connected than you thinkFrom managing blood pressure to tackling ‘bad’ cholesterol, 7 teas that are liquid wondersLove in words: Romantic quotes that aren’t cheesy6 Indian snacks you can make entirely in an air fryer10 gender-neutral baby names popular in the US10 kid-friendly destinations in India for that perfect family break7 fashion tips from Jennifer Aniston's iconic character Rachel Green123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingLinkedin Announces ListJosh Allen WifeCiaraMichael PorterAztee Egg in Adopt MeShannon SharpeLeanna LeneeAntonio BrownPatrick MahomesTaylor SwiftTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire Website'Industrial-scale liar': BJP reacts after Gurkirat Dang denies voting multiple times - vote chori rowVoter Adhikar Yatra: Bihar minister takes dig at Rahul Gandhi; tells him to thank Nitish for smooth roads making 'big yatra' possibleSave Delhi-NCR strays: When RSS chief & Rahul Gandhi speak in unison for the voiceless‘Torrents of muddy water’: Video shows Kullu flash floods; NH blocked, restoration under wayAnother cloudburst hits J&K: Heavy rain lashes Kathua village; 7 killed, several injuredBJP Parliamentary Board Meets Today to finalise NDA’s Vice-Presidential Candidate'Crossed all limits of shamelessness': Congress questions EC over refusal to share machine-readable rolls; poll body says parties failed to flag errors on time'State sponsor of terrorism': Ex-diplomat slams Pakistan; says Islamabad glorifying terrorists on I-DayFlash floods hit Himachal: Highway blocked with fresh landslide; Mandi, Kullu, Kinnaur worst hit as continuous rain hampers restoration effortsPMO may shift in Sept from South Block to Executive Enclave-I'When you learn to drive on Indian roads': Truck driver takes wrong U-turn, kills 3 in FloridaWho is Brian O’Kelley?
