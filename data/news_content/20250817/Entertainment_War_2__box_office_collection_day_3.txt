Packed with high-octane action sequences, one of the much-awaited spy thrillers, ‘War 2’ made it to the theatres on Friday, August 14, 2025. Starring Hrithik Roshan, Jr. NTR, and Kiara Advani in the lead, clashed at the box office with Thaliavar Rajinikanth’s ‘Coolie,’ which, needless to say, was one of 2025's biggest big screen clashes. The film made an impressive opening and kept the cash registers ringing even on day 2, surpassing the ‘Coolie’; however, on day 3, i.e., on Saturday, the film witnessed a significant drop in collections and was beaten by the Rajini starrer.War 2 Movie Review'War 2' box office collection day 3 updateAccording to Sacnilk, the movie opened with an impressive number of Rs 52 Cr across all languages.

Thereafter, on Independence Day, the movie witnessed a growth of around 10 percent, and the business went up to Rs 57.35 Cr, in which the collection from Hindi was Rs 44.5 Cr, Tamil Rs 0.35 Cr, and Telugu Rs 12.5 Cr. However, on Saturday, the movies couldn’t enjoy the weekend and festive surge of Janmashtami, as the collection went down to Rs. 33 Cr (early estimates) across all languages in India. With this, the total collection of ‘War 2’ after 3 days stands at Rs. 142.35 Cr. At this pace, the movie is expected to cross Rs. 150 cr with ease and create a new record.

He impresses as a high-octane action hero and in the film’s emotional moments. Junior NTR matches his energy and intensity, holding his own as a performer and in executing the action sequences. Kiara Advani makes her presence felt despite limited screen time, though the use of stunt doubles in an early fight scene is noticeable. Ashutosh Rana and Anil Kapoor are impactful in their roles.War 2 offers high-octane moments, striking visuals, and polished production to make for a passable big-screen experience. Strictly watchable only if you’re in it purely for the action and spectacle.”The chemistry between not just Hrithik and Kiara, but Hrithik and Jr. NTR is also being lauded. Besides their performance, their respective looks is being appreciated, for which each one of them followed a strict regime.War 2 - Dialogue Promo (Hindi)DISCLAIMER: The box office numbers in this article are compiled from our proprietary sources and diverse public data.
