Accusations include summoning staff for trivial tasks like picking up golf balls and tissues. Further claims suggest Andrew once requested a staff member's transfer due to a mole on his face and another for wearing a nylon tie.  Duke of York Prince Andrew mistreated his staff members and will summon his protection officer or maids to pick up his golf balls or tissues to pick that up, the royal biographer Andrew Lonie claimed in one of the episodes in Channel 5's documentary, Andrew and Fergie: The Duke and Duchess of Excess.The new documentary goes into the lives of Prince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, exploring their relationship, lavish lifestyle, business ventures, Ferguson’s financial struggles, and their controversial links to Jeffrey Epstein, as per Express UK reported. During the episode, royal biographer Lonie said, "Andrew was particularly horrible to staff; he doesn't seem to see them as normal people. He treats them as basically subordinates to be bossed around. I think he’s very narcissistic and everything is about him." Lonie further added, "He’ll summon his protection officer to pick up his golf balls after he's teed them down the fairway, he will summon maids from four floors down to open the curtains. He will drop tissues he's used on the floor and expect people to pick that up." The documentary continued: "Andrew has not commented on the new claims about his behaviour towards staff." These bombshells were exposed in a new book about the disgraced royal and his family, "The Rise and Fall Of The House of York", by Andrew Lownie. Earlier this year, it was also reported that the Duke had previously asked for a member of staff to be moved because he "disliked a mole on the man's face." This claim was made by royal author Tom Quinn, who wrote about the royal's temper in "The Times". He penned: "It’s true that some royals can display acts of ill temper. One former servant recalled how Prince Andrew insisted on a member of staff being transferred because he disliked a mole on the man’s face." Andrew Lownie’s scathing book about Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson was released last week. Quinn added: "Speaking of Andrew, that another former servant asked for a man to be 'moved to other duties for wearing a nylon tie.'" Ahead of Andrew Lonie's book release, sources close to the Duke of York reacted to the allegations which surfaced and claimed: "It would be totally inaccurate to say they are devastated or heartbroken by the book, or any of this c***. There are absolutely no new revelations—it’s just a rehash of things already said brought together in one place. The family used to wonder when this would ever end; now they know it never will. It’s just, the tide comes in and the tide goes out," the insider added to the "Daily Beast". Meanwhile, a source close to Fergie, as she is affectionately known, said the family have been "pilloried and bullied" by the British press for years and are "well used to it by now."About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
