The structure also seems to have facilitated evasion. There must be a drastic reduction in the number of rates," he said in a statement. Ramesh said simplification of the rate structure is essential, but must be done in a manner that minimises revenue uncertainty to states and also eliminates the classification disputes that have become so common. "The GST compensation cess expires on March 31, 2026. This must be extended to offset any revenue uncertainty from the rationalisation of the rate structure," he said.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousFrom Preity Mukundhan to Keerthy Suresh: South actresses' best pictures of the weekEntertainmentHiba Nawab’s stylish and chic lookstvAttractive looks of Megha AkashEntertainmentVarshini Sounderajan’s top 10 gorgeous lookstvTop 10 traditional looks of Bigg Boss fame Siri Hanumanthutv9 simple habits that can help you live longerLifestyle8 books for building self-confidence & self-worthLifestyleThe world's fastest killers: 10 animals that cause death in secondsLifestyleHow to build an organic kitchen gardenLifestyleChanneling the Sundari: Janhvi Kapoor shines in soft pink saree and delicate glamEntertainment Next123 Photostories  6 Indian snacks you can make entirely in an air fryer10 gender-neutral baby names popular in the US10 kid-friendly destinations in India for that perfect family break7 fashion tips from Jennifer Aniston's iconic character Rachel Green5 saree lessons to steal from the ever-so-graceful Vidya Balan7 fabulous looks inspired by Emma Thompson5 exercises that reverse the hidden damage of a desk job5 reasons to consume Bengali Mishti Doi and how to make it at homeFive flavours India introduced to global cuisineUpcoming Hollywood Sequels: From 'The Conjuring: Last Rites' to 'Wicked: For Good'123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingLinkedin Announces ListJosh Allen WifeCiaraMichael PorterAztee Egg in Adopt MeShannon SharpeLeanna LeneeAntonio BrownPatrick MahomesTaylor SwiftTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteGST 2.0 should be 'good, simple tax', not 'growth suppressing tax': CongressCong overhauls MP units, removes 68 district chiefs5 U'khand Cong zila panchayat men 'abducted', HC seeks reportPAC cop dies of gunshot injury; SIT to probeHealth in mind, Punjab village bans energy drinksHeavy rains disrupt 374 roads in Himachal; monsoon toll now 257Despite tech advancement, lives & assets continue to suffer: Parl panelManipur governor Bhalla to hold additional charge of NagalandIndia appreciates 'progress' at Trump-Putin Alaska meetAs Rahul kicks off yatra, EC to hold presser today to rebut ‘misinformation’Mega-tsunami warning: Could a 1,000-foot tsunami hit the US Pacific Coast?
