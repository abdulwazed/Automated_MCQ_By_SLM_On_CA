NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday launched the party’s ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’ in Bihar, a 16-day march covering more than 1,300 km across over 20 districts. The campaign, aimed at protesting against the Election Commission’s Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the voter list and what the Congress calls “vote chori,” began from Sasaram and will culminate with a rally in Patna on 1 September. Senior RJD leaders, including Lalu Prasad Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav, joined Gandhi for the launch, with preparations earlier seen outside the residence of the RJD chief in Patna.Rahul Gandhi, in a post on X, wrote: “16 days, 20+ districts, 1,300+ km. We are coming among the people with the Voter Adhikar Yatra. This is a fight to protect the most basic democratic right – ‘one person, one vote’. Join us in Bihar to save the Constitution.”Congress MP Jairam Ramesh lauded the march calling it "not just another political march, but a constitutional crusade"."The Voter Adhikar Yatra is not just another political march. It is a moral and constitutional crusade to safeguard our democracy, protect the sanctity of ‘one person, one vote,’ and ensure that the voices of the poorest and most marginalised are not stolen by fraud, manipulation, and authoritarian design," he wrote in a post on X.The route will take Gandhi through Aurangabad, Gaya, Nalanda, Sheikhpura, Munger, Bhagalpur, Purnea, Darbhanga, Sitamarhi, Champaran, Siwan, Chapra and Arrah, before concluding in Patna.
