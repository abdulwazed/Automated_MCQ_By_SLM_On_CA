He is preparing for a meeting with President Trump in DC to discuss necessary steps for resolution.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday said that Russia's refusal to accept a ceasefire was complicating efforts to end Ukraine's war, which has lasted over three years, and added that stopping the killing is a key element of stopping the war. "We see that Russia rebuffs numerous calls for a ceasefire and has not yet determined when it will stop the killing. This complicates the situation," Zelenskyy said in a post on X. "If they lack the will to carry out a simple order to stop the strikes, it may take a lot of effort to get Russia to have the will to implement far greater – peaceful coexistence with its neighbors for decades. But together we are working for peace and security. Stopping the killing is a key element of stopping the war," he added. Talking about his much-awaited meeting in DC with US President Donald Trump, Zelenskyy said that they are preparing for Monday’s meet and added that it is important that everyone agrees there needs to be a conversation at the level of leaders to clarify all the details and determine which steps are necessary and will work. "We in Ukraine welcome the principled statement of the Nordic-Baltic partners and are grateful for their very significant assistance. The unity of all strengthens each one!" he said.What Russia wanted from Ukraine in return of 'peace agreement'This statement came after a report came that Ukraine refused to accept Russian President Vladimir Putin's demand of gaining full control over Donetsk and Luhansk regions as a condition for ending the three-year war. Putin also said that in return, he will halt the frontlines in the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, where his troops control significant territory, and refrain from launching further offensives to seize additional land.Another diplomatic source said the US proposed offering Ukraine a “non-Nato Article 5” security guarantee, a pledge of collective defense-style support without granting Nato membership, which was reportedly discussed and tentatively agreed with Putin.Trump calls for peace agreement while Zelenskyy urges stronger sanctions and trilateral talks on Ukraine While President Trump has called for a comprehensive peace agreement instead of a mere ceasefire, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy urged stronger sanctions on Russia if a trilateral meeting does not take place."In my conversation with President Trump, I said that sanctions should be strengthened if there is no trilateral meeting or if Russia tries to evade an honest end to the war. Sanctions are an effective tool. Security must be guaranteed reliably and in the long term, with the involvement of both Europe and the US. All issues important to Ukraine must be discussed with Ukraine’s participation, and no issue, particularly territorial ones, can be decided without Ukraine," he said.As part of the “coalition of the willing,” Britain, France, and Germany will hold a video call with Ukraine’s allies on Sunday to coordinate peace efforts, just a day before Zelenskyy travels to Washington following the US-Russia summit. The three European powers also expressed support for a proposed trilateral summit between Zelenskyy, Putin, and Trump, after the Alaska meeting failed to deliver a ceasefire.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
