AI image used for representative purpose In midtown Manhattan, a Queens couple proved that not even the roar of a protest could overshadow their wedding day.Nicole and Richard Uraga, both 30, tied the knot at the main branch of the New York Public Library in Bryant Park, entering the iconic building just before over 700 pro-Palestine protesters gathered with signs, loud music and bombastic political chants. “When we came out, the whole protest was going on and they were banging and screaming up,” said Nicole. “But nothing can stop love,” the groom told The New York Post.The Uragas entered the building, exchanged their “I do’s” and reemerged outside as husband and wife into protesters swarming the entrance of the library. As the newlyweds took pictures near the steps celebrating their union, the protesters chanted “From the River to the Sea” and banged pots, pans and metal bowls. However, the demonstrators’ shrill shrieks could not disturb their newly minted marital bliss. “We did not let the protest get in the way of our marriage,” Nicole said. “It’s a day we’ve planned and we’ve hired a photographer and officiant and it’s a day that means something to us, August 16. So we decided to keep going on with our ceremony,” she added. The couple have been together for over 11 years and secured this date four months in advance.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
