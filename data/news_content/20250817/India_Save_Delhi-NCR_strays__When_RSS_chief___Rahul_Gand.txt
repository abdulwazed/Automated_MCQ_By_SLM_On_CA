They advocate for humane population control methods like sterilization and vaccination, criticizing the order as cruel and impractical. A helpless stray (TOI) Disagreement is inherent in Indian politics. But the recent Supreme Court order on the removal of stray dogs from Delhi-NCR has brought the RSS chief and the ideologically opposite Gandhis of Congress on the same page, amid growing anger across India over the same.Yes, from Sangh's Mohan Bhagwat to siblings Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, as well as their cousin Varun and his mother Maneka Gandhi of BJP, all have spoken out in unison against the "death sentence" meted out to the strays of Delhi-NCR.Bhagwat has advocated for a humane and scientific way to regulate the population of strays in the capital and its outskirts over mass confinement in pounds in far-off places -- an approach that echoes the animal birth control (ABC) rules mandated under law."All animals have the right to live. The problem can be solved only by regulating the population of street dogs, but it cannot be resolved by putting them in shelters," Bhagwat, a veterinary science graduate, said at a religious congregation in Cuttack on Thursday."Sheltering all street dogs is not a practical solution. The only effective way is to implement sterilisation and vaccination, as already prescribed in law," he added.Echoing similar voice, leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi has termed SC’s order to remove all stray dogs from Delhi-NCR "as a step back from decades of humane, science-backed policy".These voiceless souls are not “problems” to be erased, he wrote on X, a day after the SC order. "Shelters, sterilisation, vaccination & community care can keep streets safe -- without cruelty. Blanket removals are cruel, shortsighted, and strip us of compassion.We can ensure public safety and animal welfare go hand in hand."Similarly, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has described the dogs as "the most beautiful creatures who do not deserve this kind of cruelty". "The moving of all the city’s stray dogs to shelters within a matter of weeks is going to result in horrendously inhumane treatment of them. Enough shelters do not even exist to take them on.”Their cousin and former BJP Lok Sabha MP Varun Gandhi has described the SC order as “institutionalisation of cruelty” and “a harbinger of a legal structure that seeks to punish those who cannot fend for themselves”. "Nations face deeper moral crises when they step away from empathy,” he wrote on X.Summing up the RSS chief and Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi's unprecedented show of support for the voiceless, noted animal rights activist Maneka Sanjay Gandhi told TOI that the "issue is above politics"."It is about the soul of India. The word animal comes from anima which means soul. Are we going to survive as a compassionate society or will we become soulless violent people," Gandhi, a former Union minister said.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousSamyuktha’s style story: From chic glam to royal eleganceEntertainmentSalmonella isn’t just in chicken: Surprising foods that can make you sickLifestyleFrom Preity Mukundhan to Keerthy Suresh: South actresses' best pictures of the weekEntertainmentHiba Nawab’s stylish and chic lookstvAttractive looks of Megha AkashEntertainmentVarshini Sounderajan’s top 10 gorgeous lookstvTop 10 traditional looks of Bigg Boss fame Siri Hanumanthutv9 simple habits that can help you live longerLifestyle8 books for building self-confidence & self-worthLifestyleThe world's fastest killers: 10 animals that cause death in secondsLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Why do we place Kalash in puja ritualsKidney damage and high BP: Why blood pressure and kidneys are more connected than you thinkFrom managing blood pressure to tackling ‘bad’ cholesterol, 7 teas that are liquid wondersLove in words: Romantic quotes that aren’t cheesy6 Indian snacks you can make entirely in an air fryer10 gender-neutral baby names popular in the US10 kid-friendly destinations in India for that perfect family break7 fashion tips from Jennifer Aniston's iconic character Rachel Green5 saree lessons to steal from the ever-so-graceful Vidya Balan7 fabulous looks inspired by Emma Thompson123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingLinkedin Announces ListJosh Allen WifeCiaraMichael PorterAztee Egg in Adopt MeShannon SharpeLeanna LeneeAntonio BrownPatrick MahomesTaylor SwiftTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteSave Delhi-NCR strays: When RSS chief & Rahul Gandhi speak in unison for the voiceless‘Torrents of muddy water’: Video shows Kullu flash floods; NH blocked, restoration under wayAnother cloudburst hits J&K: Heavy rain lashes Kathua village; 4 killed, six injuredBJP Parliamentary Board Meets Today to finalise NDA’s Vice-Presidential Candidate'Crossed all limits of shamelessness': Congress questions EC over refusal to share machine-readable rolls; poll body says parties failed to flag errors on time'State sponsor of terrorism': Ex-diplomat slams Pakistan; says Islamabad glorifying terrorists on I-DayFlash floods hit Himachal: Highway blocked with fresh landslide; Mandi, Kullu, Kinnaur worst hit as continuous rain hampers restoration effortsPMO may shift in Sept from South Block to Executive Enclave-I₹34k cr in e-challans yet to be paid by violators11 killed, 36 injured in bus crash in Bengal'When you learn to drive on Indian roads': Truck driver takes wrong U-turn, kills 3 in FloridaWho is Brian O’Kelley?
