India's Mohammed Siraj and India's Dhruv Jurel celebrate their win against England on day five of the fifth cricket test match between England and India at The Kia Oval in London, Monday, Aug. 4, 2025. (AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) Former India seamer Irfan Pathan has weighed in on the workload management debate. Without directly taking Jasprit Bumrah's name, Pathan strongly criticised the idea."I believe that technology and recovery should go hand in hand," he told Lallantop.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"You should also listen to your body. But once you step onto the field, workload shouldn't be a consideration anymore. Once you step in, you are wearing the Indian jersey."After that, don't look back. You can't say, 'I will just bowl four overs' or 'I will bowl three overs.' People don’t just say this, they actually do it. That's how it works these days."I am talking about everyone, not just one player. Siraj, on the last day of the last Test, was bowling at 145 kmph. He has a workload too, right? This applies to everyone. But once you step in, you give it your all."PollDo you agree with Irfan Pathan's view that workload shouldn't be a consideration once players are on the field?AgreeDisagreeBefore the Indian team left for England, chief selector Ajit Agarkar and head coach Gautam Gambhir had said Bumrah wouldn’t feature in more than three Tests on tour due to workload management, especially after he picked up a back injury in the Sydney Test against Australia in January this year.Bumrah featured in the first Test at Headingley, Leeds, followed by the third and fourth games at Lord’s and Old Trafford, Manchester, respectively. In those three matches, Bumrah picked up 14 wickets, including two five-wicket hauls, bowling 119.4 overs at an average of 26. He wasn’t included in the playing XI for the fifth Test at The Oval and was subsequently released from the squad ahead of day two’s play.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
