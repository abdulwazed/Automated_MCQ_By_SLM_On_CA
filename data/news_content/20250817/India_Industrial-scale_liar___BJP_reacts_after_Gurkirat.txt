In the video, Dang challenges Gandhi’s allegation that he voted multiple times.“Gurkirat Singh Dang, whom Rahul Gandhi had singled out during his presentation on so-called Vote Chori, has hit back, calling him a bad loser and demanding that he produce proof to substantiate the allegation that he voted multiple times,” Malviya wrote on X.He added, “This isn’t the first time - every claim Rahul Gandhi has made has collapsed under scrutiny. Rahul Gandhi is an industrial-scale LIAR.Dang can be heard addressing Rahul Gandhi in the video saying, false allegations are not just words they bear “possible consequences” leading to “harassment, tarnishing image and eroding public trust in our democracy.” He went on to say, “losing an election doesn’t mean they were rigged.” He also demanded Rahul to present evidence that he voted four times in the last Lok Sabha elections or issue an apology.” Earlier Rahul Gandhi, during a press conference, had alleged irregularities in Karnataka electoral rolls for 2024 Lok Sabha polls and flagged instances of alleged multiple voting.
