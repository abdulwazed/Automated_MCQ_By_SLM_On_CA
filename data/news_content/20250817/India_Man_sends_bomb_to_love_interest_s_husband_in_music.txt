The investigation uncovered an illegal explosives supply network, leading to six more arrests. Authorities seized gelatin sticks and detonators, revealing a dangerous scheme and preventing a potential tragedy.  NEW DELHI: Police in Chhattisgarh foiled a planned murder attempt and uncovered an illegal explosives supply racket with the arrest of a 20-year-old electrician who allegedly planted an improvised explosive device (IED) in a music system speaker and sent it as a gift to the husband of a woman he was infatuated with, officials said on Sunday.The prime accused, identified as Vinay Verma from Kusami village in Khairagarh, was arrested along with six others in connection with the case, Khairagarh-Chhuikhadan-Gandai Superintendent of Police (SP) Lakshya Sharma told PTI.When Love Turns Lethal: Inside India’s Honeymoon Murders | The Silent Crisis No One Talks About“This action not only thwarted a planned murder but also exposed a network of illegal explosive supply in the region,” Sharma said.According to police, the conspiracy came to light when a suspicious gift-wrapped parcel, bearing a fake India Post logo, was delivered three to four days ago to a shop in Manpur village under Gandai police station limits. The parcel was addressed to local resident Afsar Khan. Finding it suspicious, Khan alerted the police.A bomb disposal team examined the package and discovered a 2-kg IED concealed inside a new music speaker. Technical analysis showed the device was designed to detonate when plugged in, with current passing to a detonator linked to the speaker’s wiring. Gelatin sticks were used as the main explosive, while the speaker’s casing would have acted as shrapnel, Sharma said.Investigators said Verma, an electrician, assembled the IED using online tutorials. His phone’s Google search history revealed searches such as “how to kill a person using a bomb without being caught by police.” Police believe he targeted Khan because he had been in one-sided love with Khan’s wife since her college days, and plotted to eliminate her husband after their marriage a few months ago.The other arrested accused have been identified as Parmeshwar Verma (25), Gopal Verma (22), Ghasiram Verma (46), Dilip Dhimar (38), Gopal Khelwar, and Khilesh Verma (19), police said. Parmeshwar allegedly paid Rs 6,000 to procure gelatin rods from Gopal and Dilip, both residents of Durg. Ghasiram delivered the explosives, while Khilesh prepared the fake India Post logo used on the parcel.Raids at the premises of Gopal and Dilip in Durg led to the seizure of 60 gelatin sticks and two detonators. Police said the explosives had been illegally diverted from a quarry in the Patharia area of Durg district, whose operator will also be questioned.In April 2023, a similar incident in neighbouring Kabirdham district claimed the lives of a newly married man and his elder brother when a home theatre system gifted by the man’s wife’s former lover exploded inside their house.Further investigation in the latest case is under way and strict legal action will be taken against all those involved, police said.(With inputs from PTI)About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
