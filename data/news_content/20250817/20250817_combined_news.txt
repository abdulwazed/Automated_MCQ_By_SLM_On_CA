We are coming among the people with the Voter Adhikar Yatra. This is a fight to protect the most basic democratic right – ‘one person, one vote’. Join us in Bihar to save the Constitution.”Congress MP Jairam Ramesh lauded the march calling it "not just another political march, but a constitutional crusade"."The Voter Adhikar Yatra is not just another political march. It is a moral and constitutional crusade to safeguard our democracy, protect the sanctity of ‘one person, one vote,’ and ensure that the voices of the poorest and most marginalised are not stolen by fraud, manipulation, and authoritarian design," he wrote in a post on X.The route will take Gandhi through Aurangabad, Gaya, Nalanda, Sheikhpura, Munger, Bhagalpur, Purnea, Darbhanga, Sitamarhi, Champaran, Siwan, Chapra and Arrah, before concluding in Patna.

Giriraj Singh likened Congress to villain Kans, predicting their defeat, while Praveen Khandelwal accused Rahul Gandhi of spreading falsehoods to regain lost ground. File photo: Union minister Giriraj Singh, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and BJP MP Praveen Khandelwal (Picture credit: ANI) NEW DELHI: The Congress party’s ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’ campaign has triggered sharp reactions from the BJP, with Union minister Giriraj Singh and party MP Praveen Khandelwal launching strong attacks on the Congress leadership.Speaking to news agency ANI, Giriraj Singh likened the Congress to villain Kans on the occasion of Janmashtami, declaring that defeat awaited them. “These people are walking the path of Kans. On the occasion of Janmashtami, I would say that Krishna destroyed Kans. There are some Kans here too, and on the occasion of Janmashtami, their destruction is certain,” Singh said.Echoing similar criticism, BJP MP Praveen Khandelwal alleged that Congress’s outreach was based on falsehoods. “The narrative that Rahul Gandhi is trying to create is based on a foundation of lies. In this regard, the people of Bihar recognise that this is primarily a journey to regain Congress's lost ground in the state. This is a journey that every single person knows about. This journey is being undertaken for political gains. It has no concern for the public,” he was quoted as saying by ANI.The ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’ has been launched against the Election Commission’s Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the voter list in Bihar and the opposition’s charge of “vote theft.” Bihar leader of opposition Tejashwi Yadav said the initiative aimed to spread awareness among those whose names had been excluded from the electoral rolls. “We are starting the ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’ from Sasaram. We will visit several districts, and our effort will be to make people aware so that no voter's name is left out. We also fought and got a relief from the Supreme Court in this matter, whether it is the Supreme Court direction to the Election Commission of India to publish the list of 65 lakh persons excluded or deleted from the Bihar draft electoral voters list, along with the reasons,” he said.Calling the campaign a “historical journey,” Yadav expressed confidence that the Mahagathbandhan would receive strong public backing. “Rahul Gandhi and other leaders of the Mahagathbandhan will go among the people and make them aware of voter rights. Along with this, we will also raise the local issues. We will also convey what our vision would be if we form our government. This is going to be a historical journey, and we will get the blessings of the Bihar voters,” he said, as per ANI.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The Congress leader addressed a 'Voter Adhikar Yatra' event in Sasaram, Bihar. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi during Bihar rally NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday called the Election Commission of India's (ECI) Special Intensive Revision in the poll-bound Bihar a "conspiracy to steal" in the upcoming assembly elections.The Lok Sabha leader of the opposition, during a rally in Bihar's Sasaram, claimed that "Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha elections are being stolen in the entire country"."I am telling you from this stage that Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha elections are being stolen in the entire country. Their latest conspiracy is to conduct SIR in Bihar and steal the Bihar elections as well. All of us have come to this stage to tell you that we will not let them steal this election," Rahul Gandhi said at Congress's 'Voter Adhikar Yatra' event.Highlighting his August 7 New Delhi press conference, where he made "vote chori" charge, Rahul Gandhi said: "The entire country knows what the election commission is doing. Earlier, the country did not know how votes were being stolen. But we made it clear in the press conference how votes are being stolen."Further stepping up his attack on the BJP on the caste census issue, the Congress scion said : "I know that PM Modi is not going to get a true caste census conducted... But the INDIA bloc will ensure a true caste census in the country."He also thanked the RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad Yadav for attending the event despite his health. "Thank you, Lalu ji, from the bottom of my heart, for coming here even though the doctor had advised you not to," he told the former Bihar chief minister.With Bihar gearing up for assembly polls, Rahul Gandhi launched the 'Vote Adhikar Yatra' from Sasaram in Rohtas district on Sunday to highlight the alleged assault on people's voting rights through the special intensive revision (SIR) of the state's electoral rolls and to make the battle against "vote theft" a mass movement. Rahul will be joined in the yatra, spread over 16 days, by members of INDIA bloc parties that are part of the "mahagathbandhan" in Bihar.

The deluge washed away roads, damaged homes, and disrupted train services on the Jammu-Pathankot line. Rescue operations are underway, with the Army, NDRF, and SDRF assisting victims.  NEW DELHI: A cloudburst in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kathua district has left at least seven people dead and several others injured, triggering landslides, flash floods and large-scale disruption. The incident, which occurred late Saturday night in Jodh Ghati village, washed away roads, damaged homes, and forced authorities into urgent rescue and relief operations.Train services along the vital Jammu-Pathankot line have also been suspended as rising water levels crossed danger marks on a key railway bridge. Helicopter evacuations have been launched, while multiple agencies including the Army, NDRF, SDRF and police are on the ground to restore connectivity and assist victims.Here are the top developments:Death toll rises to seven in KathuaOfficials confirmed that seven people have died in two separate incidents of cloudburst and landslide in Kathua. Five casualties occurred in Jodh Ghati following flash floods triggered by the overnight downpour, while two more died after a landslide in Janglote.Jammu Divisional Commissioner Ramesh Kumar said, “There was heavy rain in Kathua since last night... Seven people have died due to the landslide. Rescue operations are ongoing... Those who died due to the landslide, their bodies have been retrieved.” Rescue teams are still combing through debris and flood-hit areas amid fears of more missing persons. Helicopters were pressed into service due to washed-away roads and villages cut off from access.Train traffic disrupted on Jammu-Pathankot lineRail connectivity has been badly affected with the suspension of up-line train movement between Kathua and Budhi. Senior Divisional Commercial Manager, Jammu Railway Division, Uchit Singhal, said: “Due to heavy rains, water is flowing above the danger level through bridge number 43 between Kathua-Budhi. In view of this, temporarily till the water level subsides, up-line movement has been suspended, and in the meantime, up trains are being moved via a temporary single line through the down line track.” Villages cut off after flash floods and landslidesThe cloudburst snapped access to Jodh Ghati village, where floodwaters swept through homes and agricultural fields, leaving families stranded. Several connecting roads were washed away, and a bridge collapsed, worsening the situation. Deputy Commissioner Kathua Rajesh Sharma confirmed that rescue operations are underway and that stranded people are being shifted to safer areas. Local police reported that a station building in Kathua had also been damaged. Rescue operations led by Army and NDRFThe Indian Army, NDRF, SDRF, police and BRO have been deployed in full strength across Kathua. Heavy machinery has been brought in to fragment massive boulders that rolled down into residential areas. Inspector General of Police, Jammu Zone, Bhim Sen Tuti, said, “Boulders had fallen here which needed to be fragmented... Heavy machinery has been called for that. With the help of BRO, they are being fragmented here. These boulders are being removed by using explosives wherever needed, and bodies have been recovered from beneath them.”Helicopter evacuation for injured victimsUnion minister Jitendra Singh confirmed that helicopter services were arranged to shift injured people to nearby hospitals. In his social media post, Singh wrote, “Helicopter services have been arranged for shifting the injured to appropriate hospitals. 6 injured have been airlifted for hospitalisation in Mamoon, Pathankot, which was found to be relatively nearer destination.” DIG Police Shiv Kumar Sharma and his team are camping at the site and coordinating airlifts. Centre closely monitoring situation, says Amit ShahUnion home minister Amit Shah assured full support from the Central government. In a post on X, Shah wrote, “Spoke with the Lieutenant Governor and Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir regarding the cloudburst in Kathua. Relief and rescue operations are being carried out by the local administration, and NDRF teams have also been rushed to the site. Assured every support from the Modi government. We stand firmly behind our sisters and brothers of J&K.” LG Manoj Sinha calls tragedy 'mind-numbing'Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha expressed grief over the loss of lives. In his message on X, he wrote: “Deeply anguished by the loss of lives in the devastating rain-triggered landslides in several areas of Kathua. The tragedy is mind-numbing. Briefed Hon’ble Union Home Minister Sh. Amit Shah Ji on rescue and relief operations by the army, NDRF, SDRF, police & administration.” CM Omar Abdullah announces ex-gratia reliefChief minister Omar Abdullah conveyed condolences and directed immediate assistance for affected families. A statement from his office said Rs 2 lakh would be given for each deceased, Rs 1 lakh for severely injured, and Rs 50,000 for those with minor injuries. Compensation has also been announced for damaged homes: Rs 1 lakh for fully damaged houses, Rs 50,000 for severely damaged houses, and Rs 25,000 for partially damaged houses. “The Chief Minister has directed the administration to carry out immediate relief, rescue and evacuation measures to ensure the safety and support of affected families,” the statement said.Repeated cloudburst disasters in J&KThe Kathua disaster comes just three days after a cloudburst in Kishtwar’s Chisoti village killed 60 people and injured over 100. Experts warn that frequent extreme weather in J&K is linked to changing rainfall patterns and climate pressures in the Himalayan region. Officials say the back-to-back incidents highlight the need for stronger disaster preparedness and better drainage infrastructure. While the state government has sought central assistance, locals in Kathua have urged long-term flood protection measures. This includes improved embankments, real-time weather alerts, and a review of building norms in vulnerable areas.Connectivity and services slowly being restoredAuthorities are now focused on restoring essential services, including power, water and road links. In Kishtwar, where floods occurred earlier, officials said blasting of boulders was undertaken to clear blocked roads. Rope bridges are being built to reconnect cut-off villages in Kathua. “The power supply and water supply have been restored. A bridge is being built here with the help of the Army... All the passengers stranded in Machail were safely evacuated yesterday,” said Divisional Commissioner Ramesh Kumar.

The investigation uncovered an illegal explosives supply network, leading to six more arrests. Authorities seized gelatin sticks and detonators, revealing a dangerous scheme and preventing a potential tragedy.  NEW DELHI: Police in Chhattisgarh foiled a planned murder attempt and uncovered an illegal explosives supply racket with the arrest of a 20-year-old electrician who allegedly planted an improvised explosive device (IED) in a music system speaker and sent it as a gift to the husband of a woman he was infatuated with, officials said on Sunday.The prime accused, identified as Vinay Verma from Kusami village in Khairagarh, was arrested along with six others in connection with the case, Khairagarh-Chhuikhadan-Gandai Superintendent of Police (SP) Lakshya Sharma told PTI.When Love Turns Lethal: Inside India’s Honeymoon Murders | The Silent Crisis No One Talks About“This action not only thwarted a planned murder but also exposed a network of illegal explosive supply in the region,” Sharma said.According to police, the conspiracy came to light when a suspicious gift-wrapped parcel, bearing a fake India Post logo, was delivered three to four days ago to a shop in Manpur village under Gandai police station limits. The parcel was addressed to local resident Afsar Khan. Finding it suspicious, Khan alerted the police.A bomb disposal team examined the package and discovered a 2-kg IED concealed inside a new music speaker. Technical analysis showed the device was designed to detonate when plugged in, with current passing to a detonator linked to the speaker’s wiring. Gelatin sticks were used as the main explosive, while the speaker’s casing would have acted as shrapnel, Sharma said.Investigators said Verma, an electrician, assembled the IED using online tutorials. His phone’s Google search history revealed searches such as “how to kill a person using a bomb without being caught by police.” Police believe he targeted Khan because he had been in one-sided love with Khan’s wife since her college days, and plotted to eliminate her husband after their marriage a few months ago.The other arrested accused have been identified as Parmeshwar Verma (25), Gopal Verma (22), Ghasiram Verma (46), Dilip Dhimar (38), Gopal Khelwar, and Khilesh Verma (19), police said. Parmeshwar allegedly paid Rs 6,000 to procure gelatin rods from Gopal and Dilip, both residents of Durg. Ghasiram delivered the explosives, while Khilesh prepared the fake India Post logo used on the parcel.Raids at the premises of Gopal and Dilip in Durg led to the seizure of 60 gelatin sticks and two detonators. Police said the explosives had been illegally diverted from a quarry in the Patharia area of Durg district, whose operator will also be questioned.In April 2023, a similar incident in neighbouring Kabirdham district claimed the lives of a newly married man and his elder brother when a home theatre system gifted by the man’s wife’s former lover exploded inside their house.Further investigation in the latest case is under way and strict legal action will be taken against all those involved, police said.(With inputs from PTI)About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Congress MP Manish Tewari cites ‘trust deficit’ with Election Commission; Akhilesh Yadav presses for reforms (Picture credit: PTI, ANI) NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India (ECI) is facing mounting criticism from opposition parties, with Congress MP Manish Tewari and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav both questioning the poll body’s credibility in light of allegations over voter list manipulation.As per news agency ANI, Tewari said the Commission was struggling with a “trust deficit,” arguing that it carried “very little conviction” and “almost zero credibility” among political circles and the wider public. Objecting to the current system of appointments for the Chief Election Commissioner and Election Commissioners, he stressed that the executive’s “veto” in the process was undermining confidence. “As long as the executive veto remains with regard to the appointment of the Commissioners of the EC, no matter how many press conferences the EC does it will not matter even one bit whatsoever,” he wrote on X.He further urged the poll body to “correct the widely held perception that it is an extension counter of the Union Government,” warning that it had acquired a negative label similar to “Godi Media,” which, he said, was harmful for Indian democracy.Meanwhile, Samajwadi Party’s leader Akhilesh Yadav also targeted the Commission, saying it needed “not just reform but an inevitable fundamental transformation.” In a post shared on X, Yadav stated, “The historic responsibility of saving democracy rests on their shoulders. It is understood that they are under various kinds of undesirable pressures, but they should not think they are alone. When the Election Commission starts walking on the right path, the support of millions of Indians will become its protective shield. The public and public trust naturally align with those who walk the path of truth.”He added that even one “courageous step” by the Commission could safeguard the future of generations.Yadav’s comments came as opposition parties raised objections to the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of voter rolls in Bihar. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had earlier alleged voter list manipulation and produced what he called “proof” at a press conference. The Commission, in response, has asked Gandhi to provide a signed affidavit and submit the evidence formally for investigation.RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav also joined the criticism, accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party of “misusing Constitutional agencies” and attempting to “destroy democracy and the Constitution.” He vowed to resist any effort to deny people their voting rights, saying, “We will fight wherever we want and we will not let our rights be erased.”The Election Commission, however, defended its procedures, stating that errors in electoral rolls should be raised during the “Claims and Objections” period. According to the Commission, digital and physical copies of the final roll are shared with recognised political parties and candidates to ensure scrutiny at the right time. “Had these issues been raised at the right time through the right channels, it would have enabled the concerned SDM EROs to correct the mistakes, if genuine, before those elections,” the EC said in its release.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Rahul Gandhi (left), NItish Kumar (TOI) NEW DELHI: Bihar minister Ashok Choudhary on Sunday took a sharp dig at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi ahead of the launch of the party's 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', saying he should thank chief minister Nitish Kumar for improving road infrastructure in the state, which made the rally possible, reported news agency ANI.“Rahul Gandhi should thank Nitish Kumar, for the roads that used to be in such bad shape are now so smooth that Rahul Gandhi is even able to take out a Yatra... He should be grateful that such a big Yatra will be possible due to Nitish Kumar's roads,” Choudhary said, as quoted by the agency.The Congress-led yatra is being launched from Sasaram in protest against the election commission’s special intensive revision (SIR) of the electoral rolls in Bihar. The party, along with INDIA block allies, alleges large-scale voter exclusion and “vote theft”.Senior leaders including RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, former Bihar deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav, Congress president mallikarjun kharge and Rahul Gandhi are expected to participate. Preparations for the event are underway outside in Patna.Bihar leader of opposition Tejashwi Yadav, addressing the media on Saturday, said the campaign aims to raise awareness among voters whose names have been excluded from the electoral list."We are starting the 'Vote Adhikar Yatra' from Sasaram tomorrow. Tomorrow, we will all be with the Mahagathbandhan allies. We will visit several districts, and our effort will be to make people aware so that no voter's name is left out. We also have fought for this and got a relief from the Supreme Court in this matter, whether it is the Supreme Court direction to the Election Commission of India to publish the list of 65 lakh persons excluded or deleted from the Bihar draft electoral voters list, along with the reasons," Yadav said. Calling the yatra as a “historical journey”, Tejashwi said the Mahagathbandhan would take its message to multiple districts and seek public support. "Tomorrow, Rahul Gandhi and other leaders of the Mahagathbandhan will go among the people and make them aware of voter rights. Along with this, we will also raise the local issues. We will also convey what our vision would be if we form our government. This is going to be a historical journey, and we will get the blessings of the Bihar voters," he added.The yatra will begin on Sunday, from Sasaram, Bihar.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Save Delhi-NCR strays: When RSS chief & Rahul Gandhi speak in unison for the voiceless
A rare consensus has emerged in Indian politics as leaders from opposing ideologies, including RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and Congress' Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, unite against the Supreme Court's order to remove stray dogs from Delhi-NCR. They advocate for humane population control methods like sterilization and vaccination, criticizing the order as cruel and impractical.

They advocate for humane population control methods like sterilization and vaccination, criticizing the order as cruel and impractical. A helpless stray (TOI) Disagreement is inherent in Indian politics. But the recent Supreme Court order on the removal of stray dogs from Delhi-NCR has brought the RSS chief and the ideologically opposite Gandhis of Congress on the same page, amid growing anger across India over the same.Yes, from Sangh's Mohan Bhagwat to siblings Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, as well as their cousin Varun and his mother Maneka Gandhi of BJP, all have spoken out in unison against the "death sentence" meted out to the strays of Delhi-NCR.Bhagwat has advocated for a humane and scientific way to regulate the population of strays in the capital and its outskirts over mass confinement in pounds in far-off places -- an approach that echoes the animal birth control (ABC) rules mandated under law."All animals have the right to live. The problem can be solved only by regulating the population of street dogs, but it cannot be resolved by putting them in shelters," Bhagwat, a veterinary science graduate, said at a religious congregation in Cuttack on Thursday."Sheltering all street dogs is not a practical solution. The only effective way is to implement sterilisation and vaccination, as already prescribed in law," he added.Echoing similar voice, leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi has termed SC’s order to remove all stray dogs from Delhi-NCR "as a step back from decades of humane, science-backed policy".These voiceless souls are not “problems” to be erased, he wrote on X, a day after the SC order. "Shelters, sterilisation, vaccination & community care can keep streets safe -- without cruelty. Blanket removals are cruel, shortsighted, and strip us of compassion.We can ensure public safety and animal welfare go hand in hand."Similarly, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has described the dogs as "the most beautiful creatures who do not deserve this kind of cruelty". "The moving of all the city’s stray dogs to shelters within a matter of weeks is going to result in horrendously inhumane treatment of them. Enough shelters do not even exist to take them on.”Their cousin and former BJP Lok Sabha MP Varun Gandhi has described the SC order as “institutionalisation of cruelty” and “a harbinger of a legal structure that seeks to punish those who cannot fend for themselves”. "Nations face deeper moral crises when they step away from empathy,” he wrote on X.Summing up the RSS chief and Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi's unprecedented show of support for the voiceless, noted animal rights activist Maneka Sanjay Gandhi told TOI that the "issue is above politics"."It is about the soul of India. The word animal comes from anima which means soul. Are we going to survive as a compassionate society or will we become soulless violent people," Gandhi, a former Union minister said.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousSamyuktha’s style story: From chic glam to royal eleganceEntertainmentSalmonella isn’t just in chicken: Surprising foods that can make you sickLifestyleFrom Preity Mukundhan to Keerthy Suresh: South actresses' best pictures of the weekEntertainmentHiba Nawab’s stylish and chic lookstvAttractive looks of Megha AkashEntertainmentVarshini Sounderajan’s top 10 gorgeous lookstvTop 10 traditional looks of Bigg Boss fame Siri Hanumanthutv9 simple habits that can help you live longerLifestyle8 books for building self-confidence & self-worthLifestyleThe world's fastest killers: 10 animals that cause death in secondsLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Why do we place Kalash in puja ritualsKidney damage and high BP: Why blood pressure and kidneys are more connected than you thinkFrom managing blood pressure to tackling ‘bad’ cholesterol, 7 teas that are liquid wondersLove in words: Romantic quotes that aren’t cheesy6 Indian snacks you can make entirely in an air fryer10 gender-neutral baby names popular in the US10 kid-friendly destinations in India for that perfect family break7 fashion tips from Jennifer Aniston's iconic character Rachel Green5 saree lessons to steal from the ever-so-graceful Vidya Balan7 fabulous looks inspired by Emma Thompson123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingLinkedin Announces ListJosh Allen WifeCiaraMichael PorterAztee Egg in Adopt MeShannon SharpeLeanna LeneeAntonio BrownPatrick MahomesTaylor SwiftTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteSave Delhi-NCR strays: When RSS chief & Rahul Gandhi speak in unison for the voiceless‘Torrents of muddy water’: Video shows Kullu flash floods; NH blocked, restoration under wayAnother cloudburst hits J&K: Heavy rain lashes Kathua village; 4 killed, six injuredBJP Parliamentary Board Meets Today to finalise NDA’s Vice-Presidential Candidate'Crossed all limits of shamelessness': Congress questions EC over refusal to share machine-readable rolls; poll body says parties failed to flag errors on time'State sponsor of terrorism': Ex-diplomat slams Pakistan; says Islamabad glorifying terrorists on I-DayFlash floods hit Himachal: Highway blocked with fresh landslide; Mandi, Kullu, Kinnaur worst hit as continuous rain hampers restoration effortsPMO may shift in Sept from South Block to Executive Enclave-I₹34k cr in e-challans yet to be paid by violators11 killed, 36 injured in bus crash in Bengal'When you learn to drive on Indian roads': Truck driver takes wrong U-turn, kills 3 in FloridaWho is Brian O’Kelley?

Prime Minister Modi and key leaders will decide, with RSS endorsement expected. Potential candidates include Acharya Devvrat and Thawarchand Gehlot, balancing caste dynamics. PM Narendra Modi and others (agencies)  NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Parliamentary Board is set to convene on Sunday at the party headquarters in New Delhi to finalize the National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA) candidate for the upcoming Vice-Presidential election, scheduled for September 9. The meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will include key leaders such as Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, and BJP President J.P. Nadda, among others. The NDA has authorized Modi and Nadda to select the candidate for this critical constitutional post, with the decision expected to be endorsed by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).The urgency to select a candidate follows the abrupt resignation of former Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar on July 21, 2025, citing health reasons, though speculations of political differences had surfaced. Sources indicate that the BJP is keen on choosing a candidate deeply rooted in the BJP-RSS ecosystem, with names like Gujarat Governor Acharya Devvrat, Karnataka Governor Thawarchand Gehlot, Sikkim Governor Om Mathur, and Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha being considered. Devvrat, a Jat community member, is a strong contender to appease the community, while Gehlot’s selection could bolster the BJP’s outreach to backward caste voters.The NDA, with its majority in the electoral college comprising Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha members, is poised for an easy victory if the election is contested. The opposition INDIA bloc may field a candidate, with discussions slated for August 18. Meanwhile, all NDA Chief Ministers and Deputy Chief Ministers have been summoned to Delhi on August 21 for the nomination filing, signaling a unified front. The decision on Sunday is expected to reflect strategic political calculations, balancing caste dynamics and RSS influence.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousSamyuktha’s style story: From chic glam to royal eleganceEntertainmentSalmonella isn’t just in chicken: Surprising foods that can make you sickLifestyleFrom Preity Mukundhan to Keerthy Suresh: South actresses' best pictures of the weekEntertainmentHiba Nawab’s stylish and chic lookstvAttractive looks of Megha AkashEntertainmentVarshini Sounderajan’s top 10 gorgeous lookstvTop 10 traditional looks of Bigg Boss fame Siri Hanumanthutv9 simple habits that can help you live longerLifestyle8 books for building self-confidence & self-worthLifestyleThe world's fastest killers: 10 animals that cause death in secondsLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Why do we place Kalash in puja ritualsKidney damage and high BP: Why blood pressure and kidneys are more connected than you thinkFrom managing blood pressure to tackling ‘bad’ cholesterol, 7 teas that are liquid wondersLove in words: Romantic quotes that aren’t cheesy6 Indian snacks you can make entirely in an air fryer10 gender-neutral baby names popular in the US10 kid-friendly destinations in India for that perfect family break7 fashion tips from Jennifer Aniston's iconic character Rachel Green5 saree lessons to steal from the ever-so-graceful Vidya Balan7 fabulous looks inspired by Emma Thompson123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingLinkedin Announces ListJosh Allen WifeCiaraMichael PorterAztee Egg in Adopt MeShannon SharpeLeanna LeneeAntonio BrownPatrick MahomesTaylor SwiftTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteSave Delhi-NCR strays: When RSS chief & Rahul Gandhi speak in unison for the voiceless‘Torrents of muddy water’: Video shows Kullu flash floods; NH blocked, restoration under wayAnother cloudburst hits J&K: Heavy rain lashes Kathua village; 4 killed, six injuredBJP Parliamentary Board Meets Today to finalise NDA’s Vice-Presidential Candidate'Crossed all limits of shamelessness': Congress questions EC over refusal to share machine-readable rolls; poll body says parties failed to flag errors on time'State sponsor of terrorism': Ex-diplomat slams Pakistan; says Islamabad glorifying terrorists on I-DayFlash floods hit Himachal: Highway blocked with fresh landslide; Mandi, Kullu, Kinnaur worst hit as continuous rain hampers restoration effortsPMO may shift in Sept from South Block to Executive Enclave-I₹34k cr in e-challans yet to be paid by violators11 killed, 36 injured in bus crash in Bengal'When you learn to drive on Indian roads': Truck driver takes wrong U-turn, kills 3 in FloridaWho is Brian O’Kelley?

K C Venugopal questioned the EC's transparency, citing denial of machine-readable rolls and deletion of CCTV footage.  NEW DELHI: Congress party on Saturday launched a sharp attack on the Election Commission, accusing it of having "crossed all limits of shamelessness" and failing in its constitutional duty. The party demanded that the poll body explain why it continues to deny political parties access to machine-readable electoral rolls and CCTV footage.“The ECI has crossed all limits of shamelessness by shrugging all its responsibilities in the face of grave allegations of vote theft and mass rigging. Constitutional authorities are expected to be the epitome of probity - not hide behind vaguely drafted press notes to hide their guilt in destroying democracy,” Congress general secretary K C Venugopal said in a post on X.PollDo you think the Election Commission is transparent in handling electoral rolls?Yes, it maintains transparencyNo, more clarity is neededVenugopal said that the burden of identifying large-scale discrepancies in voter data cannot be placed solely on political parties and their booth-level agents. He questioned the commission’s claims of “utmost transparency” in electoral roll preparation and listed several concerns, including denial of machine-readable rolls, deletion of CCTV footage within 45 days, the EC’s submission before the Supreme Court regarding the deletion of 65 lakh names in Bihar, and its refusal to meet opposition MPs.Sharing the EC’s recent press note, he said, “The tone and tenor of this press note raises greater suspicions that the ECI will take no steps to address the public’s grave concerns about mass scale vote rigging done by the BJP-controlled ECI.”Responding to opposition allegations, the election commission said the appropriate time for political parties to flag errors is during the claims and objections period after draft electoral rolls are published. “It seems that some political parties and their booth level agents (BLAs) did not examine the electoral rolls at the appropriate time and did not point out errors, if any,” the EC said in its statement.The commission also noted that certain parties and individuals have recently raised questions about errors in both current and past electoral rolls.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

'State sponsor of terrorism': Ex-diplomat slams Pakistan; says Islamabad glorifying terrorists on I-Day

She warned India must remain vigilant, echoing PM Modi's stance that any terror act will be considered an act of war. Representative image NEW DELHI: Former diplomat Veena Sikri has strongly criticised Pakistan for honouring terrorists during its Independence Day events, calling it yet another example of Islamabad’s deep-rooted support for terror groups. Speaking to news agency ANI, Sikri described Pakistan as a “terror monger” state and warned that India must remain alert.“We have always said that Pakistan is a state sponsor of terrorism. It is a matter of great concern to India. And our Prime Minister has now declared the new normal that every act of terror will be considered an act of war. So this is a big warning to Pakistan,” Sikri was quoted as saying by ANI. She cautioned that Islamabad must not allow its army or groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba to operate, stressing that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s words amount to a “huge warning” against any further misadventure."So I hope they will heed that warning. What they did on their own Independence Day on 14th August just proves the point. They have always been supporting terrorism. They have always been supporting terrorist groups, giving them money," she said.Sikri also alleged that Pakistan was using International Monetary Fund (IMF) funds to rebuild infrastructure destroyed during India’s Operation Sindoor. “They are now offered to build all their buildings which were destroyed during the Operation Sindoor with government money. So all the money going from the IMF is going for this purpose. It is terrible, and the world should take note of that,” she said.In his Independence Day address, Prime Minister Modi hailed the success of Operation Sindoor and saluted the armed forces for striking terror camps in Pakistan. He recalled the Pahalgam attack in Jammu and Kashmir where “husbands were killed in front of their wives and fathers were killed in front of their children after asking their religion,” saying the operation was India’s answer to such brutality. “Our brave jawans punished the enemy beyond its imagination,” PM Modi said from the Red Fort.The Prime Minister also underlined that Operation Sindoor had inflicted “heavy losses” on Pakistan and marked a new phase in India’s fight against cross-border terrorism. Rejecting Islamabad’s “nuclear blackmail,” he reaffirmed that India would retaliate decisively against any future attacks.

Soon, the Cabinet Secretariat will also shift from Rashtrapati Bhavan to this new office complex, which is also likely to get a new name.Ministries of home affairs and personnel have almost been shifted to Kartavya Bhawan-3, which PM Narendra Modi inaugurated earlier this month. TOI has learnt that PMO may move in the second half of Sept.'Will Shape India's Future as a Developed Nation': Modi Inaugurates Kartavya Bhavan | Central VistaOfficials said going by the trend of govt naming all Central Vista projects, such as Ka-rtavya Path (earlier Raj Path) and Kartavya Bhawan, signifying a change in its approach, Executive Enclave-I may also get a name, something linked to 'service' (sewa).North & South Block to be turned into public museum In his address to PMO officials after taking oath for the third consecutive time as PM, Modi had said, "PMO should become an institution of service and the people's PMO" and that it should serve as a catalytic agent, generating new energy to provide light to the entire system. Shifting of offices from North Block and South Block to new buildings is crucial as the govt is keen to expedite the conversion of these two iconic buildings into a public museum called 'Yuge Yugeen Bharat Sangrahalaya'. The Prime Minister had recently said that this will allow every citizen to witness and experience India's rich civilisational journey.The British-era North Block and South Block buildings have been the power centre for nearly 80 years, housing offices of the Prime Minister, and ministries of defence, home, external affairs and finance.A govt source, who was earlier involved in the master planning of the Central Vista revamp project, told TOI that one of the main rationale behind shifting these top offices, which make national policies, from these two buildings was to remove traces of colonial mindset.

In a written reply to a Parliament question, the road transport ministry has said that till July 27, around Rs 20,000 crore (out of the total Rs 54,360 crore) has been collected as fines against the e-challans issued.Police and transport departments in just five states - Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Haryana and Delhi - have issued over 20 crore challans to violators, more than 50% of all challans issued across the country."This indicates that e-challaning is yet to pick up across several states. There has been a significant increase in electronic enforcement in the past couple of years as more cities are going for CCTV surveillance. Also, there is now a focus on ensuring that due procedures are followed by law enforcement agencies while issuing challans," said a govt official. In fact, data show that while in the past one year, around 9.2 crore e-challans were issued across states and UTs with a cumulative penalty of Rs 16,662 crore, the enforcement agencies recovered only Rs 3,447 crore from violators.Considering the high pendency of e-challans on account of several factor, the road transport ministry has issued a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to states and UTs specifying the norms to be followed.High pendency of E-challans* Total challans issued since jan 2015: 36.2 cr* Total challan amount: Rs 54,360 cr* Challans disposed of: 13.8 cr* Revenue collected: Rs 20,152 cr* Challans sent to court: 9.9 cr* Challans disposed of in courts: 1.5 crTop 5 states (booked challans)Tamil Nadu: 7.3 crUttar Pradesh: 7.1 crKerala: 3.6 crHaryana: 1.8 crDelhi: 1.4 crEnd of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJasmin Bhasin’s inspired top 10 glamorous lookstvSamyuktha’s style story: From chic glam to royal eleganceEntertainmentSalmonella isn’t just in chicken: Surprising foods that can make you sickLifestyleFrom Preity Mukundhan to Keerthy Suresh: South actresses' best pictures of the weekEntertainmentHiba Nawab’s stylish and chic lookstvAttractive looks of Megha AkashEntertainmentVarshini Sounderajan’s top 10 gorgeous lookstvTop 10 traditional looks of Bigg Boss fame Siri Hanumanthutv9 simple habits that can help you live longerLifestyle8 books for building self-confidence & self-worthLifestyle Next123 Photostories  The ultimate 4 P formula for continued successWhen leading ladies said no to big rolesWhy do we place Kalash in puja ritualsKidney damage and high BP: Why blood pressure and kidneys are more connected than you thinkFrom managing blood pressure to tackling ‘bad’ cholesterol, 7 teas that are liquid wondersLove in words: Romantic quotes that aren’t cheesy6 Indian snacks you can make entirely in an air fryer10 gender-neutral baby names popular in the US10 kid-friendly destinations in India for that perfect family break7 fashion tips from Jennifer Aniston's iconic character Rachel Green123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingLinkedin Announces ListJosh Allen WifeCiaraMichael PorterAztee Egg in Adopt MeShannon SharpeLeanna LeneeAntonio BrownPatrick MahomesTaylor SwiftTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire Website'Industrial-scale liar': BJP reacts after Gurkirat Dang denies voting multiple times - vote chori rowVoter Adhikar Yatra: Bihar minister takes dig at Rahul Gandhi; tells him to thank Nitish for smooth roads making 'big yatra' possibleSave Delhi-NCR strays: When RSS chief & Rahul Gandhi speak in unison for the voiceless‘Torrents of muddy water’: Video shows Kullu flash floods; NH blocked, restoration under wayAnother cloudburst hits J&K: Heavy rain lashes Kathua village; 7 killed, several injuredBJP Parliamentary Board Meets Today to finalise NDA’s Vice-Presidential Candidate'Crossed all limits of shamelessness': Congress questions EC over refusal to share machine-readable rolls; poll body says parties failed to flag errors on time'State sponsor of terrorism': Ex-diplomat slams Pakistan; says Islamabad glorifying terrorists on I-DayFlash floods hit Himachal: Highway blocked with fresh landslide; Mandi, Kullu, Kinnaur worst hit as continuous rain hampers restoration effortsPMO may shift in Sept from South Block to Executive Enclave-I'When you learn to drive on Indian roads': Truck driver takes wrong U-turn, kills 3 in FloridaWho is Brian O’Kelley?

The structure also seems to have facilitated evasion. There must be a drastic reduction in the number of rates," he said in a statement. Ramesh said simplification of the rate structure is essential, but must be done in a manner that minimises revenue uncertainty to states and also eliminates the classification disputes that have become so common. "The GST compensation cess expires on March 31, 2026. This must be extended to offset any revenue uncertainty from the rationalisation of the rate structure," he said.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousFrom Preity Mukundhan to Keerthy Suresh: South actresses' best pictures of the weekEntertainmentHiba Nawab’s stylish and chic lookstvAttractive looks of Megha AkashEntertainmentVarshini Sounderajan’s top 10 gorgeous lookstvTop 10 traditional looks of Bigg Boss fame Siri Hanumanthutv9 simple habits that can help you live longerLifestyle8 books for building self-confidence & self-worthLifestyleThe world's fastest killers: 10 animals that cause death in secondsLifestyleHow to build an organic kitchen gardenLifestyleChanneling the Sundari: Janhvi Kapoor shines in soft pink saree and delicate glamEntertainment Next123 Photostories  6 Indian snacks you can make entirely in an air fryer10 gender-neutral baby names popular in the US10 kid-friendly destinations in India for that perfect family break7 fashion tips from Jennifer Aniston's iconic character Rachel Green5 saree lessons to steal from the ever-so-graceful Vidya Balan7 fabulous looks inspired by Emma Thompson5 exercises that reverse the hidden damage of a desk job5 reasons to consume Bengali Mishti Doi and how to make it at homeFive flavours India introduced to global cuisineUpcoming Hollywood Sequels: From 'The Conjuring: Last Rites' to 'Wicked: For Good'123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingLinkedin Announces ListJosh Allen WifeCiaraMichael PorterAztee Egg in Adopt MeShannon SharpeLeanna LeneeAntonio BrownPatrick MahomesTaylor SwiftTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteGST 2.0 should be 'good, simple tax', not 'growth suppressing tax': CongressCong overhauls MP units, removes 68 district chiefs5 U'khand Cong zila panchayat men 'abducted', HC seeks reportPAC cop dies of gunshot injury; SIT to probeHealth in mind, Punjab village bans energy drinksHeavy rains disrupt 374 roads in Himachal; monsoon toll now 257Despite tech advancement, lives & assets continue to suffer: Parl panelManipur governor Bhalla to hold additional charge of NagalandIndia appreciates 'progress' at Trump-Putin Alaska meetAs Rahul kicks off yatra, EC to hold presser today to rebut ‘misinformation’Mega-tsunami warning: Could a 1,000-foot tsunami hit the US Pacific Coast?

The system automates request submission, translator assignment, and progress tracking, enhancing efficiency and service quality. It supports real-time interpretation during court proceedings, ensuring accurate communication for non-Arabic speakers and reinforcing transparency within the judicial process.  The Ministry of Justice now handles all judicial translation requests digitally through the e-Litigation platform, improving speed and accuracy/ Image: File The Ministry of Justice in Saudi Arabia has formally launched a centralized translation service through its e-Litigation platform, streamlining all judicial translation processes to support efficient legal communication and case handling.A system-wide overhaul of judicial translation services The Unified Translation Center is now operational on the e-Litigation platform, enabling centralized management of judicial translation requests. The service encompasses the entire translation process, from the initial request by a beneficiary to completion, within a single digital workflow. The platform automates the receipt of translation requests, which can originate from lawsuits or judicial departments, and coordinates their assignment to translators. It also provides tools for monitoring and supervision, ensuring the status of each request can be tracked throughout its lifecycle. The integration allows beneficiaries, such as litigants, legal representatives, and courts, to follow the progress of their translation requests step-by-step, aiming to improve the quality, speed, and efficiency of translation services within judicial procedures.Addressing language barriers in Saudi courts The Unified Translation Center, under the Ministry of Justice, offers remote interpretation services for non-Arabic speakers during court hearings. By utilizing videoconferencing and the e-Litigation system, interpreters, including those specializing in sign language, can assist in real time, ensuring accurate understanding between judicial panels and individuals involved in legal proceedings who do not speak Arabic. This initiative was launched with a clear goal: to eliminate communication barriers in courtrooms and legal environments, providing transparent interpretation to safeguard due process and individual rights. It emphasizes accuracy and ensures that non-Arabic speakers are given full clarity and participation during legal procedures.Platform access through Najiz The Najiz platform, which serves as the Ministry of Justice’s unified digital services portal, hosts the translation functionality. In August 2023, the Ministry introduced a dedicated feature on Najiz titled “Request for an Interpreter”. This allows non-Arabic speaking users to request translation services directly online. Najiz is part of a broader effort by the Ministry to provide comprehensive judicial services digitally, aimed at improving user experience and service accessibility.Institutional context and evolution The Ministry of Justice is one of the most longstanding government entities in Saudi Arabia. Established by Royal Order in 1962, the Ministry was tasked with overseeing all courts and fulfilling their administrative and financial needs. Although it was founded in 1962, the Ministry began executing its formal duties in 1970 under the leadership of the first appointed Minister of Justice, Mohammed Bin Ali al-Harkhan, who served until 1975. Among all ministries under the Council of Ministers, the Ministry of Justice is one of only three that has never undergone a name change, merger, or dissolution, the others being the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Health. The Ministry is headquartered in Riyadh and is managed by a Minister appointed via Royal Order, who also holds membership in the Council of Ministers.Vision 2030 and strategic justice reforms The broader modernization of judicial services, including digital translation and litigation processes, is aligned with the national transformation program Saudi Vision 2030. The Ministry’s active reform phase began after the first meeting of the Council of Economic and Development Affairs in 2016, where His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, Crown Prince and Prime Minister, launched the Vision. As part of this alignment, the Ministry of Justice adopted thirteen strategic goals, all contributing to systemic improvements across its various sectors. These sectors include:  Judiciary   Enforcement   Documentation   Reconciliation   Advocacy   Judicial Training Center   Each plays a role in transforming legal services to be more efficient, accessible, and aligned with global standards.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

'I’m gonna blow you up': Woman arrested for bomb threat call to University of Central Florida; spammed professor with texts and selfies

She also sent a barrage of incoherent texts and photos to a UCF professor. AI Image used for representative purpose A Florida woman was arrested after drunkenly phoning the University of Central Florida just after the summer term ended, and dropped the bomb threat. Kristin Galli, 29, allegedly called UCF’s Student Care Services on May 22, blurting out, “I’m gonna f–king blow you guys up” before hanging up the phone, according to an arrest affidavit recently unsealed, NY Post reported. The staff member attempted to call Galli back, but she did not answer. However, the officer was able to quickly identify her using her voicemail and phone number in the centre’s call history, as stated in the affidavit obtained by Fox 35. Around the same time, Galli also allegedly texted more than 200 “incoherent” messages and pictures of herself to a UCF professor from the same number found in the call history, officials said. The next day, police tracked down Galli, and she admitted to making the calls while she “was angry” and “thought it would be funny” while under the influence, according to the affidavit. Galli was swiftly cuffed and faces charges related to false reporting of a bombing on state-owned property and unlawful use of a two-way communication. After being booked, Galli appeared stunned in her mugshot as she stared dead-eyed at the camera, her clownish makeup messily smudged across her face with crooked glasses and green hair. She is scheduled to appear in court on 21 August. Bomb threats are reportedly a common tactic among multiple Florida criminals. An elderly Florida man made a bomb joke at an airport while trying to flirt with another traveller last year. “If the bomb in my bag goes off prematurely, I apologize to your family in advance,” he reportedly told her. Last fall, another Florida man who was allegedly planning to bomb the New York Stock Exchange was arrested after accidentally making plans with undercover FBI agents.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

She and her boyfriend, Samuel Cabrera, were arrested in 2016. Lyon abused girls she babysat, some with special needs. Parents spoke of betrayal and lasting pain. Text messages showed Lyon trading access to children. Lyon apologized in a letter, but the court delivered a harsh sentence. Image: X@/CollinRugg A babysitter from California was sentenced to 100 years of life in state prison on Thursday for participating with her boyfriend in the sexual abuse of several girls she was hired to care for. Brittney Mae Lyon, 31, along with her boyfriend, Samuel Cabrera, was arrested in 2016 after one of the victims disclosed the abuse to her mother. Lyon, who advertised babysitting services online and told parents she was especially interested in working with children with special needs, sexually abused several young girls and allowed her boyfriend to abuse them as well.The victims were between 3 and 7 years old, as per prosecutors. Two had been diagnosed with autism, and one was nonverbal, reported NBC San Diego. Lyon was sentenced to 100 years to life in prison on August 14. Cabrera was convicted by a jury in 2019 and, in 2021, received eight life sentences without the possibility of parole. Under California parole laws, Lyon will be eligible to petition for parole at age 50, which means she could serve as little as 19 years behind bars.“After the horrific sexual crimes Brittney Lyon committed against children, District Attorney Summer Stephan did her job in securing a just sentence of 100 years-to-life,” State senate minority leader Brian Jones said as quoted by the New York Post.  "What made her the perfect vehicle for these crimes was the benign and harmless nature of her appearance, her background, the way she presented herself to these victims' parents. She seemed like the perfect babysitter, the perfect person someone could trust," deputy district attorney Jodi Breton was quoted as saying by NBC San Diego. At Thursday morning’s sentencing, several parents of the victims spoke of the trust they had placed in Lyon and their devastation upon discovering the abuse."You knew how to win our trust and manipulate to get what you want," a woman said, recounting how Lyon had requested to take her autistic daughter on outings, supposedly to support her studies for a child development degree. "You are the most sick and evil monster that society has. What you did to these innocent and most helpless of children, without any conscience, care or concern, or ounce of remorse, is unfathomable," said another woman whose daughter was 3-and-a-half years old at the time of the abuse. "We let you into our home and into our lives. Because of that, my family has endured almost 10 years of suffering and pain. The betrayal is a wound that has never healed," said the mother of the then 7-year-old girl, the victim whose disclosure ultimately led to the couple’s arrest. Text messages between Lyon and Cabrera reportedly revealed her “bartering” access to a child in exchange for being taken out on dates, said attorney Jodi Breton. Lyon’s defense attorney, Sloan Ostbye, read a letter from her in which she offered an apology to the victims’ families."The words `I'm sorry' are far too simple for the amount of trauma I've caused and the amount of regret I feel. ... You trusted me to keep your children safe and instead I placed them in harm's way. My actions were selfish, inconsiderate and thoughtless to everyone involved,” the letter read.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Afghanistan: Taliban seeks control of rivers; neighbours fear flow cuts

These initiatives, aimed at boosting food security, are raising concerns among neighboring countries like Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Iran, who fear reduced water flows and destabilized water-sharing agreements.

These initiatives, aimed at boosting food security, are raising concerns among neighboring countries like Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Iran, who fear reduced water flows and destabilized water-sharing agreements. AI image After decades of war, Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries. Since taking power in 2021, the Taliban have launched large-scale infrastructure projects, including dams and canals, to harness river flows that spill into Iran, Pakistan, and Central Asia. But as per news agency AFP, these efforts are fuelling disputes, with climate change worsening water shortages across the region.Central Asia on alert over Qosh Tepa canalThe most contentious initiative is the Qosh Tepa canal, a mega-project designed to irrigate 560,000 hectares of farmland in northern Afghanistan. Experts say it could divert up to 21 per cent of the Amu Darya’s flow, a river already vital for water-stressed Central Asian states. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, backed by Kazakhstan, have raised alarms that the project could further shrink the Aral Sea and destabilise the region’s water-sharing arrangements, which date back to the Soviet era.Water governance specialist Mohd Faizee cautioned and was quoted by AFP as saying, “No matter how friendly the tone is now, at some point there will be consequences for Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan when the canal starts operating.”Taliban officials, however, insist the canal will not cause significant harm. Project manager Sayed Zabihullah Miri was cited by AFP as saying that the Amu Darya has “an abundance of water, especially when it floods and glacial meltwater flows into it”. They argue the project is critical to boosting food security in a country where climate-driven crop failures and humanitarian crises remain widespread.Iran revives Helmand disputeIran, Afghanistan’s western neighbour, is the only country with a formal water-sharing treaty, signed in 1973 over the Helmand river. But the accord has never been fully honoured. Tehran frequently accuses Kabul of restricting flows through upstream dams, especially during droughts. The Taliban maintain that water scarcity, worsened by climate change, leaves them unable to release more.A report by the Afghanistan Analysts Network noted that Afghan authorities also believe they have long been denied their fair share of Helmand waters due to poor management and political neglect. Meanwhile, disputes also simmer over the Harirud basin, which flows into Iran and Turkmenistan, where Afghanistan recently inaugurated the Pashdan dam. Analysts say reduced security risks after the war could accelerate such projects, reshaping regional water dynamics.Pakistan watching Kabul basin closelyTo the east, Afghanistan shares the Kabul river basin with Pakistan, which eventually feeds into the Indus. Unlike Iran, no treaty exists between the two neighbours. While water disputes have not dominated their rocky bilateral relations, Kabul’s attempts to revive old river projects and build new ones could trigger friction.Yet, Afghanistan’s financial struggles and lack of technical expertise mean most large-scale projects will take years to complete. This delay may ease immediate diplomatic concerns, but for Afghans grappling with severe water shortages in the capital and beyond, the wait could deepen suffering.Climate crisis drives displacementAfghanistan’s water disputes cannot be separated from the worsening climate emergency. According to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM), nearly five million people were affected by floods, droughts, and other climate shocks in early 2025, with almost 400,000 displaced. “Crop failure, dry pastures and vanishing water sources are pushing rural communities to the edge,” the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation warned in July.Villagers in the north were quoted by AFP as saying that they were pinning hopes on the Qosh Tepa canal to revive farming, though its completion is still more than a year away. In contrast, communities in western Herat have watched the Harirud river run dry, forcing families who were deported from Iran to return to barren land with little to farm.Meanwhile, extreme rainfall has added another layer of crisis. Warmer temperatures mean heavier downpours, often triggering devastating flash floods. In Maidan Wardak, a community leader said, “I’m around 54 years old, and we have never experienced problems like this before.”Taliban officials admit their efforts fall short. Energy and water minister Abdul Latif Mansoor recently conceded that while canal and dam projects are underway, “the measures we have taken so far are not enough”. Limited funding, international isolation and restrictive governance have left Afghanistan struggling to cope with climate shocks, even as it faces one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.For millions of Afghans, everything now comes down to water, too little in times of drought, too much during floods, as the Taliban’s push for control over rivers becomes a defining issue for the country and its neighbours alike.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The LAUSD is responding by increasing security around schools. Cruz's teammates and community members are rallying to support him and his family, highlighting his positive character and the impact of his absence.  A Los Angeles high school senior was taken into custody by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents last week, allegedly leaving his dog loose on the street during the arrest. The student, identified as 18-year-old Benjamin Marcelo Guerrero Cruz, was detained in Van Nuys on Friday, August 8, according to Newsweek citing GoFundMe campaign created on his behalf.'American Nightmare': Anti-ICE Protests Rock NYC Federal Plaza; Arrests Amid Trump DeportationsGuerrero-Cruz helps take care of his 5-month-old twin brothers and his 6-year-old brother, the GoFundMe post said. He's described in the post as a "devoted son, a caring brother, a loyal friend, and a valued member of our community," ABC news reported. The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) confirmed the incident and its spokesperson said, "Los Angeles Unified stands united in protecting every student and family during this period of heightened immigration enforcement.""Working closely with city leaders and municipal partners, we have strengthened safety measures at and around our schools. This includes enhanced communication with various entities, visible presence in impacted communities, and rapid-response protocols should enforcement activity occur."  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) told KTLA that Cruz had overstayed his visa by more than two years, with his visa waiver programme expiring in March 2023. Cruz is currently held in ICE detention in LA. As of Friday morning, over Rs 24,000 had been raised to cover his legal fees and basic needs for his mother and siblings, who also live in fear of federal agents. Friends have expressed support for Cruz, with his soccer teammates describing him as reliable, respectful, and kind. The arrest coincided with the temporary detention of a 15-year-old student with disabilities elsewhere in LA on Monday morning. In response, LAUSD is deploying staff and school police to patrol streets around 100 schools to protect students from ICE and other agents. At a news conference on Thursday, LAUSD Superintendent Alberto Carvalho stated, "He is 18 years old, but he's a kid. He has not been exposed to anything in his life. He drinks water once a day. The food is insufficient. Mom said that there was not enough room for everybody to sit or lie down at the same time." Ronny C, a soccer teammate of Cruz, said on the GoFundMe page, "We're devastated to lose such a good kid and great teammate. On the field, he was rock-solid—always showed up, worked hard, and could be counted on week after week. Off the field, he was just as reliable: kind, respectful, and someone who lifted up the people around him. He brought consistency, heart, and a quiet strength that made the team better in every way. It's heartbreaking to see him taken from us like this, and we'll truly miss not just the player, but the person he was." The standoff between LA officials, including Mayor Karen Bass, and the Trump administration continues, with the President stating that ICE has full authority to arrest and detain individuals in sanctuary cities suspected of being illegally present in the U.S.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The incident occurred after an argument reportedly over a girl. Devan Scott Raper, 19, is accused of fatally shooting Trey Dean Wright. Wright's girlfriend and others are charged as accessories. The investigation revealed that at least one person recorded the killing. . Nine teenagers in South Carolina have been arrested in connection with the death of a 16-year-old boy, which reportedly stemmed from an argument “over a girl” with the alleged gunman, as per local reports. Among those charged is the victim’s 17-year-old girlfriend.Trey Dean Wright, 16, was found fatally shot on June 24, with multiple gunshot wounds, on First Neck Road in Florence County, about 45 miles (approximately 72 km) west of Myrtle Beach, reported Fox News. Deputies arrested 19-year-old Devan Scott Raper of Conway the next day, who is accused of fatally shooting Wright after an argument. At least one teenager allegedly recorded the killing on video, and additional arrests were made in the following weeks as the investigation unfolded."All this court hearing and bond court and stuff is driving me crazy," Ashley Lindsey, Wright’s mother, was quoted as saying by Fox News. "I don't even have time to sit down and think half the time, on top of losing my precious baby."Wright’s 17-year-old girlfriend, Giann Kistenmacher, faces charges as an accessory before the fact for allegedly bringing Raper to meet Wright despite knowing he was armed.Also charged in connection with the setup were 18-year-olds Corrine Belviso and Hunter Kendall, along with 17-year-old Sydney Kearns. Online jail records show Kendall has been in custody since July 31, while Belviso was arrested on Tuesday and Kearns on Monday.Kendall and Belviso are scheduled to appear in Florence County Circuit Court on September 17, while no court date has been listed for Kearns.Details about the four additional suspects have not been released because they are minors, said authorities. “They were complicit in bringing the armed codefendant, Raper to the incident location and knowing that there would be a confrontation,” Maj. Michael Nunn of the Florence County sheriff’s office was quoted as saying by WBTW-TV. “They knew that Raper had presented a firearm to the victim and made threats to shoot him, according to the arrest warrants,” he said. The fatal shooting seemed to have stemmed from an argument tied to a romantic rivalry. "They had issues with each other, and it was over a female," sheriff T.J. Joye was quoted as saying by WBTW-TV.  "The sad thing is, you got a 16-year-old that lost his life. You’ve got a 19-year-old who is going to be in jail the rest of his life. Over what?"Raper has been charged with murder and possession of a weapon during a violent crime and is currently being held without bond.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

'Prince Andrew was horrible to staff’: Bombshell revelations in new documentary—what did the royal biographer claim?
Prince Andrew faces renewed scrutiny over his alleged mistreatment of staff, detailed in a Channel 5 documentary and Andrew Lownie's new book. Accusations include summoning staff for trivial tasks like picking up golf balls and tissues. Further claims suggest Andrew once requested a staff member's transfer due to a mole on his face and another for wearing a nylon tie.

Accusations include summoning staff for trivial tasks like picking up golf balls and tissues. Further claims suggest Andrew once requested a staff member's transfer due to a mole on his face and another for wearing a nylon tie.  Duke of York Prince Andrew mistreated his staff members and will summon his protection officer or maids to pick up his golf balls or tissues to pick that up, the royal biographer Andrew Lonie claimed in one of the episodes in Channel 5's documentary, Andrew and Fergie: The Duke and Duchess of Excess.The new documentary goes into the lives of Prince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, exploring their relationship, lavish lifestyle, business ventures, Ferguson’s financial struggles, and their controversial links to Jeffrey Epstein, as per Express UK reported. During the episode, royal biographer Lonie said, "Andrew was particularly horrible to staff; he doesn't seem to see them as normal people. He treats them as basically subordinates to be bossed around. I think he’s very narcissistic and everything is about him." Lonie further added, "He’ll summon his protection officer to pick up his golf balls after he's teed them down the fairway, he will summon maids from four floors down to open the curtains. He will drop tissues he's used on the floor and expect people to pick that up." The documentary continued: "Andrew has not commented on the new claims about his behaviour towards staff." These bombshells were exposed in a new book about the disgraced royal and his family, "The Rise and Fall Of The House of York", by Andrew Lownie. Earlier this year, it was also reported that the Duke had previously asked for a member of staff to be moved because he "disliked a mole on the man's face." This claim was made by royal author Tom Quinn, who wrote about the royal's temper in "The Times". He penned: "It’s true that some royals can display acts of ill temper. One former servant recalled how Prince Andrew insisted on a member of staff being transferred because he disliked a mole on the man’s face." Andrew Lownie’s scathing book about Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson was released last week. Quinn added: "Speaking of Andrew, that another former servant asked for a man to be 'moved to other duties for wearing a nylon tie.'" Ahead of Andrew Lonie's book release, sources close to the Duke of York reacted to the allegations which surfaced and claimed: "It would be totally inaccurate to say they are devastated or heartbroken by the book, or any of this c***. There are absolutely no new revelations—it’s just a rehash of things already said brought together in one place. The family used to wonder when this would ever end; now they know it never will. It’s just, the tide comes in and the tide goes out," the insider added to the "Daily Beast". Meanwhile, a source close to Fergie, as she is affectionately known, said the family have been "pilloried and bullied" by the British press for years and are "well used to it by now."About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Suffering from severe organic wasting, her case highlights the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where widespread malnutrition and starvation are escalating due to the ongoing conflict. AP file photo  A Palestinian woman, who was evacuated from Gaza to Italy for treatment after suffering from extreme malnutrition, has died at a hospital in Pisa, officials said.Marah Abu Zuhri, 20, traveled with her mother to Pisa on an overnight flight on Wednesday as part of an Italian government evacuation programme. The University Hospital of Pisa said she went into cardiac arrest and died on Friday, less than two days after her arrival.She had a “very complex clinical picture” and was “in a profound state of organic wasting,” stated doctors of the hospital, as per the Guardian. The hospital did not provide further details about her condition, but Italian news agencies, citing medical sources, reported that she had been suffering from severe malnutrition.Thirty-one patients and their companions arrived this week in Rome, Milan, and Pisa, many suffering from severe congenital conditions, injuries, or amputations, as per the Italian foreign ministry. Since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas, Italy has evacuated and received more than 180 children and young people from the besieged Gaza Strip.The UN has raised alarms over widespread malnutrition in Gaza, with experts supported by the organisation warning in a report last month that a “worst-case scenario” of famine is already unfolding.The UN World Food Programme reported in July that one-third of Gaza’s population endures days without food, while around half a million people are facing imminent starvation.“The worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip,” said the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) last month urging an immediate ceasefire to ease “widespread starvation.”Israel’s defence ministry said that it will start supplying Gaza City residents with tents and other equipment on Sunday ahead of relocating them to designated “safe zones”. The announcement came shortly after the government confirmed plans to occupy Gaza City, followed by days of intense bombardment in Zeitoun, the city’s largest district.The situation in Zeitoun was “catastrophic”, a municipal spokesperson was quoted as saying by the BBC, citing mass displacement after six consecutive days of heavy Israeli airstrikes, shelling, and demolitions.There have been more than 250 instances of hunger-related deaths in the war-ravaged territory since the start of the conflict in October 2023. Eleven people died from malnutrition last week, as per the health ministry.  “There is no policy of starvation in Gaza, and there is no starvation in Gaza,” Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last month.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Despite the noise and demonstrations outside, the couple proceeded with their planned ceremony, exchanging vows and taking photos as protesters chanted nearby. AI image used for representative purpose In midtown Manhattan, a Queens couple proved that not even the roar of a protest could overshadow their wedding day.Nicole and Richard Uraga, both 30, tied the knot at the main branch of the New York Public Library in Bryant Park, entering the iconic building just before over 700 pro-Palestine protesters gathered with signs, loud music and bombastic political chants. “When we came out, the whole protest was going on and they were banging and screaming up,” said Nicole. “But nothing can stop love,” the groom told The New York Post.The Uragas entered the building, exchanged their “I do’s” and reemerged outside as husband and wife into protesters swarming the entrance of the library. As the newlyweds took pictures near the steps celebrating their union, the protesters chanted “From the River to the Sea” and banged pots, pans and metal bowls. However, the demonstrators’ shrill shrieks could not disturb their newly minted marital bliss. “We did not let the protest get in the way of our marriage,” Nicole said. “It’s a day we’ve planned and we’ve hired a photographer and officiant and it’s a day that means something to us, August 16. So we decided to keep going on with our ceremony,” she added.

The letter was hand-delivered to the Russian leader by US President Donald Trump ahead of his summit with Putin at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska on Friday, according to Fox News.First lady’s message emphasized the war’s devastating effect on children, describing them as “caught in the crosshairs” of the violence.Her letter began with “Dear President Putin, Every child shares the same quiet dreams in their heart, whether born randomly into a nation’s rustic countryside or a magnificent city-center. They dream of love, possibility, and safety from danger.”“As parents, it is our duty to nurture the next generation’s hope. As leaders, the responsibility to sustain our children extends beyond the comfort of a few”, Melania wrote.letterThe letter marked the first lady’s second involvement in foreign affairs with the Eastern European power. Melania played a role in convincing her husband to increase military aid to Ukraine and adopt a tougher stance on Russia in dealings related to the protracted war.Calling children “a purity, an innocence which stands above geography, government, and ideology,” Mrs. Trump urged Putin to act. “Mr. Putin, you can singlehandedly restore their melodic laughter,” she wrote. “In protecting the innocence of these children, you will do more than serve Russia alone, you serve humanity itself.”The letter concluded with a time-bound note to act on the current situation. “Such a bold idea transcends all human division, and you, Mr. Putin, are fit to implement this vision with a stroke of the pen today. It is time.”The letter was presented to Putin just before the Alaska summit.Trump described the Alaska meeting as “extremely productive,” while clarifying that no formal agreement was reached. Both leaders gave positive accounts of the meeting, though no signed deal emerged. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to travel to Washington DC on Monday to meet President Trump.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Pursued by ICE agents, Montoya ran onto the 210 Freeway and was struck by a vehicle. While ICE denies direct pursuit, the incident sparked outrage, with State Assemblymember John Harabedian condemning the raids. AP file photo A man fleeing an immigration raid at a Home Depot in Southern California was struck by a vehicle and killed on a freeway on Thursday as federal agents closed in, authorities said.The victim has been identified as Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdés, 52, of Guatemala, by the National Day Laborer Organizing Network.Montoya fled a Home Depot in Monrovia, about 20 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents launched their operation Thursday morning, stated Monrovia city manager Dylan Feik. A local police officer observed the raid after the department received a report of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in the area, Feik was quoted as saying by NBC News. During the operation, an individual ran onto the 210 Freeway, he said.Moments later, the fire department and emergency crews were dispatched to a report of a pedestrian struck by a vehicle.Montoya was reportedly attempting to cross north across the eastbound lanes of Interstate 210 when he was struck by an SUV travelling around 60 mph in the far-left lane. He was struck by the vehicle’s front right side, sustained severe injuries, and later died at a hospital.The individual who ran onto the freeway was “not being pursued by any DHS law enforcement,” ICE was quoted as saying by CNN. “We do not know their legal status. We were not aware of this incident or notified by California Highway Patrol until hours after operations in the area had concluded.”The company is not “notified that ICE activities are going to happen, and we aren’t involved in the operations,” Beth Marlowe, a Home Depot spokesperson, was quoted as saying by NBC News.In a statement shared on his Instagram story, State Assemblymember John Harabedian, who represents Monrovia, said 10 people were detained in the raid. "Raids like this do not make our streets safer — they terrorize families, instill fear, and put lives at risk," he said.“CHP can confirm that the incident occurred within the vicinity of a federal enforcement operation,” stated the California Highway Patrol, which is investigating the incident. “However, CHP cannot confirm the connection between the enforcement operation and the fatality at this time.”Dozens gathered in the parking lot of the Monrovia Home Depot for a solemn march honoring Montoya on Friday.“We’re here to just to lift up his humanity, to say his name … and to say that this cannot happen anymore,” Rev. Francisco Garcia, who co-chairs the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles’ Sacred Resistance ministry, was quoted as saying by CNN.Immigration authorities have focused many of their recent operations on Home Depot stores and other home improvement retailers where day laborers often gather.Enforcement Removal Operations agents carried out a “targeted enforcement operation” last week, at a Home Depot in Washington, DC, as part of the Trump administration’s broader crackdown on immigrants and unhoused people in the city.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

While a filet mignon lunch was scrapped, the summit shifted focus from a ceasefire to a broader peace deal. Zelensky's upcoming White House visit will address Putin's proposal for Ukraine to cede territory in exchange for international peacekeepers.  Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump held a nearly three-hour closed-door meeting in Alaska, which produced no concrete deal but went beyond a mere conversation on a Ukraine peace agreement.An eight-page document, accidentally left in a hotel printer ahead of the high-profile Ukraine peace talks, offered a glimpse into the planned meeting between the two presidents, New York Post reported.The page contained details such as President Trump’s planned gift for Vladimir Putin and the lunch menu for their summit. The leak, first reported by NPR, went viral after guests at the Hotel Captain Cook discovered the printouts in a public printer. While the material revealed little sensitive security information — most of the summit agenda at Joint Base Elmendorf–Richardson was already public — it did include some quirky details. Among them, a planned filet mignon lunch with champagne vinaigrette salad that was later scrapped, a seating chart with Trump and Putin at the center, and a pronunciation note instructing aides to say the Russian leader’s name as “POO-tihn.” Another page revealed Trump intended to gift Putin a bald eagle desk statue, along with phone numbers of advance staff. Most of the listed events were either altered or abandoned after Trump shifted his focus from an immediate ceasefire to pursuing a broader peace deal. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to visit the White House on Monday, where discussions are expected to center on Putin’s proposal that Ukraine cede remaining parts of Donetsk in exchange for an international peacekeeping force, including British and French troops, to deter further Russian aggression.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

He is preparing for a meeting with President Trump in DC to discuss necessary steps for resolution.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday said that Russia's refusal to accept a ceasefire was complicating efforts to end Ukraine's war, which has lasted over three years, and added that stopping the killing is a key element of stopping the war. "We see that Russia rebuffs numerous calls for a ceasefire and has not yet determined when it will stop the killing. This complicates the situation," Zelenskyy said in a post on X. "If they lack the will to carry out a simple order to stop the strikes, it may take a lot of effort to get Russia to have the will to implement far greater – peaceful coexistence with its neighbors for decades. But together we are working for peace and security. Stopping the killing is a key element of stopping the war," he added. Talking about his much-awaited meeting in DC with US President Donald Trump, Zelenskyy said that they are preparing for Monday’s meet and added that it is important that everyone agrees there needs to be a conversation at the level of leaders to clarify all the details and determine which steps are necessary and will work. "We in Ukraine welcome the principled statement of the Nordic-Baltic partners and are grateful for their very significant assistance. The unity of all strengthens each one!" he said.What Russia wanted from Ukraine in return of 'peace agreement'This statement came after a report came that Ukraine refused to accept Russian President Vladimir Putin's demand of gaining full control over Donetsk and Luhansk regions as a condition for ending the three-year war. Putin also said that in return, he will halt the frontlines in the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, where his troops control significant territory, and refrain from launching further offensives to seize additional land.Another diplomatic source said the US proposed offering Ukraine a “non-Nato Article 5” security guarantee, a pledge of collective defense-style support without granting Nato membership, which was reportedly discussed and tentatively agreed with Putin.Trump calls for peace agreement while Zelenskyy urges stronger sanctions and trilateral talks on Ukraine While President Trump has called for a comprehensive peace agreement instead of a mere ceasefire, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy urged stronger sanctions on Russia if a trilateral meeting does not take place."In my conversation with President Trump, I said that sanctions should be strengthened if there is no trilateral meeting or if Russia tries to evade an honest end to the war. Sanctions are an effective tool. Security must be guaranteed reliably and in the long term, with the involvement of both Europe and the US. All issues important to Ukraine must be discussed with Ukraine’s participation, and no issue, particularly territorial ones, can be decided without Ukraine," he said.As part of the “coalition of the willing,” Britain, France, and Germany will hold a video call with Ukraine’s allies on Sunday to coordinate peace efforts, just a day before Zelenskyy travels to Washington following the US-Russia summit. The three European powers also expressed support for a proposed trilateral summit between Zelenskyy, Putin, and Trump, after the Alaska meeting failed to deliver a ceasefire.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

‘Incredibly isolated’: New Zealand mom and son freed after weeks in US immigration detention – who is she?
Sarah Shaw, a New Zealand citizen living in the U.S., and her son were detained for over three weeks due to a travel permit error after a trip to Canada. Despite her work permit renewal, Shaw mistakenly believed her travel authorization was also extended.

Despite her work permit renewal, Shaw mistakenly believed her travel authorization was also extended.  A US mother and her 6-year-old son were released this week after spending more than three weeks in US immigration detention, following a brief trip to Canada and what her attorney called a minor paperwork mistake. Sarah Shaw, a 33-year-old New Zealand citizen who has lived legally in the U.S. since 2021, was detained at the Blaine, Washington, border checkpoint while returning from Vancouver, where she had dropped her two older children off for a flight to New Zealand to visit their grandparents. Shaw’s attorney, Minda Thorward, told CNN that Shaw didn’t realize her travel permit—part of a “combo card” granting both work and travel authorization—had expired. Although her son’s documents were valid, both were taken into custody by Customs and Border Protection and transferred nearly 2,000 miles away to the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas.In June, Shaw received confirmation of her work permit renewal, but mistakenly believed it also extended her travel authorization – a “minor administrative paperwork error” – according to her lawyer.“She had completely re-established herself. She had a full-time job, an apartment, adopted a dog, a new boyfriend, and the kids were in school and doing great,” Thorward said. “She made a mistake, but she has no previous convictions – none. This is a very clean case.”Shaw, who works for the state of Washington and had just renewed her work permit, mistakenly believed the renewal also extended her travel authorization. Her attorney said she applied for humanitarian parole, which would have allowed her to return home, but was denied. Requests for her boyfriend or a friend to collect her son were also rejected. A friend of Shaw’s, Victoria Besancon, told CNN Shaw has spent three weeks in a cramped detention facility, feeling “incredibly isolated.” “Each room contains 5 to 6 bunk beds, and rooms are locked from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.,” Besancon told CNN, adding that she has been able to phone Shaw daily and recently video chat. Her son, who had expected to spend summer vacation at home, spent weeks confined indoors with limited activities. “There’s not a lot for kids to do—maybe some coloring books,” Thorward said. Shaw arrived in the U.S. in 2021, married a citizen that year, and later filed an I-360 petition after the marriage ended. Her application remains pending. She has since built a life in Washington—working full time, raising her children, and preparing to begin a master’s degree in psychology this month at Northwest University. A CBP spokesperson defended the detention, saying individuals with expired parole documents must be held under immigration law. ICE has insisted its family facilities are safe and equipped with medical, dental, and mental health services, though critics argue the conditions are traumatizing for children. New Zealand’s foreign ministry confirmed it was in contact with Shaw but declined to share details, citing privacy.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services has asked officers to heavily focus on "good moral character" while considering citizenship applications of immigrants. It is not a new requirement and good moral character usually refers to the absence of criminal offenses of disqualifying conduct outlined in US immigration law, but the new policy said the "good moral character" assessment will be expanded. What is good moral character in the new policy?It is more than a cursory mechanical review focused on the absence of any wrongdoing, the USCIS policy said. Instead, it should be a holistic assessment of an immigrant's behavior, adherence to societal norms, positive contributions towards the community.Mexico Rejects Trump Immigration Crackdown Deal; Claudia Sheinbaum Blasts DC's PoliciesThe markers of a good moral character areCommunity involvementFamily caregiving and tiesEducational attainmentStable and lawful employmentTax-paying statusLength of time spent in the USDifference between lawful and good moral characterTh new USCIS policy explains the difference between a technically lawful immigrant and an immigrant with good moral character. Reckless or habitual traffic infractions, or harassment or aggressive solicitation are some of the actions that make a difference between the two. The new USCIS policy instructed officers to weigh factors that could show that applicants who have engaged in wrongdoing have rehabilitated, such as complying with probation, paying overdue taxes or child support and receiving letters of support from their community."US citizenship is the gold standard of citizenship — it should only be offered to the world's best of the best," USCIS chief spokesman Matthew Tragesser told CBS News. "Today, USCIS is adding a new element to the naturalization process that ensures America's newest citizens not only embrace America's culture, history, and language but who also demonstrate Good Moral Character."A former USCIS official from the Biden administration, Doug Rand, said this is designed to scare legal immigrants from applying for US citizenship. "They're trying to increase the grounds for denial of US citizenship by kind of torturing the definition of good moral character to encompass extremely harmless behavior," Rand said.

After President Donald Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska Friday, eight pages of a document which was supposed to be secret, were found at the business center of an Alaskan hotel -- possibly left behind by the US team by mistake. NPR reported about the papers adding that it's not known whether they were authentic documents but they included US State Department markings and were found on a public printer. The hotel is about 20 minutes away from where Putin and Trump convened at the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, NPR reported.The documents revealed that Trump intended to gift Putin an "American Bald Eagle Desk Statue" and it's not known whether it was gifted to him. The document shared precise locations and meeting time schedules along with the phone numbers of US government employees. The document listed the names of Russian leaders with phonetic spellings, making Putin "Mr President Poo-tihn", NPR reported. NPR posted a menu that included a “green salad” with “champagne vinaigrette” paired with surf and turf consisting of a filet mignon with “brandy peppercorn sauce” and “buttery whipped potatoes and roasted asparagus” with halibut, a fish found in Russia’s arctic waters.For something sweet, crème brûlée was reportedly planned for dessert. But the lunch was for some reason called off.A seating chart shows that Putin and Trump were supposed to sit across from each other during the luncheon. Trump would be flanked by six officials: Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles to his right, and Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and Special Envoy for Peace Missions Steve Witkoff to his left.White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly dismissed the papers as a "multi-page lunch menu" and suggested leaving the information on a public printer was not a security breach.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

A Canadian court has blocked the deportation of Jagjit Singh, an Indian-origin man, citing that his separation from his wife, who has ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder), will cause "irreparable harm" to the wife. According to the court filing, Singh came to Canada in 2021 on a temporary resident visa and made a refugee claim. Then he got married in Canada and his wife applied to sponsor his permanent resident application, and Jagjit Singh withdrew his refugee claim this year.But his removal process already began while his resident application was under review and the Canada Border Services Agency finally ordered him to be deported. Singh appealed to Canada's federal court against the deportation order and claimed that he would be in danger if he were sent back to India.Singh also claimed that his removal would cause "serious prejudices to his spouse due to her health conditions".Federal Judge Avvy Yao-Yao Go said she has evidence in front of her that Singh's wife, referred to as LB in court documents, suffers from ADHD which impairs her ability to manage time and everyday responsibilities. "In the case before me, there is evidence that L.B. suffers from ADHD which impairs her ability to manage time, stress focus and everyday responsibilities and that [Singh] provides her with support by, among other things, helping her maintain daily structure and reminders for medications and appointments, and providing her with emotional stability and mental health support," Go said.The ruling drew backlash on social media, with many users pointing out that ADHD is not that serious. "The judge who halted an Indian man's deportation order because his wife has ADHD was an activist before being appointed to the bench," one wrote. Many social media users said his wife should also go to India with him. "I wonder how his wife survived before she met him?" one person said. "This is beyond insulting. Not only to people with ADHD, but to our country. So pathetic," another wrote.The judge faced backlash for citing his wife’s ADHD as an excuse, with many saying it undermined those who actually suffer from the condition Avvy Yao-Yao Go immigrated to Canada from Hong Kong in the 1980s and worked as Clinic Director of the Chinese and Southeast Asian Legal Clinic before becoming a judge.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

One of the group took his metal water bottle and hit him above the eye, causing heavy bleeding. He was taken to hospital where he received eight stitches. Gardaí confirmed they are investigating the assault and his injuries are “non-life threatening”.An Indian-origin woman has put a post on Reddit saying her 60-year-old father was harassed by boys, aged around seven and eight, who tried to take his wallet at a bus stop in Dublin on Aug 9.These are just the latest in a string of racist attacks targeting Indians in Ireland which have left the Indian community terrified to step outside.India Day in Ireland, which celebrates the country’s cultural ties, has been postponed this Sunday owing to the wave of hate crimes. The event has been organised by the Ireland India Council since 2015. A Ficci India Day event is going ahead in Dublin on Aug 17.Indian community leaders met Ireland deputy PM Simon Harris on Monday after which he condemned the “despicable acts of violence and racism”.Chairman of the Ireland India Council Prashant Shukla told Ireland AM: “We weren’t worried about the event itself as the Gardaí assured us about safety, but we were worried about the perception it could lead to further attacks. Our message to the Irish community is that these attacks are attacks on your economy and industry. Policing needs to go to the next level. I feel there are not proper investigations and arrests. We are all working, paying taxes and contributing to the economy. No one is getting a free house. People are spreading misinformation that Indians buying houses is causing house prices to go up.”President of Ireland Michael D Higgins on Tuesday also condemned the attacks. “A lot of Indians are reconsidering their choices and may move back to India if the situation doesn’t improve. It is mostly being caused by far-right groups encouraging teenagers to attack immigrants. Indians are the most visible immigrants here,” said Indian national Some Aditya Mandal, who has worked in Dublin for eight years.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle10 baby names that mean creativity and visionLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?Maharashtra’s UNESCO World Heritage Sites and other iconic monuments for history loversRajinikanth completes 50 years in cinema: Lesser-known facts about the ‘Coolie’ star6 lizards that prove reptiles can be adorableHow to unrot your brain: 5 effective steps to sharpen focus and boost mental clarityFrom Mullum Malarum to Kabali: Rajinikanth’s most emotional movies that fans still cherish123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

Dr Ajay Aggarwal, an Indian-origin pain medicine doctor from Houston, has agreed to pay over $2 million to resolve allegations of medical fraud against him, the US Justice Department revealed. Between 2021 and 2023, the 63-year-old doctor billed federally funded health care programs like Medicare and the Department of Labor’s Workers’ Compensation Programs for surgical implants that he never performed. Dr Aggarwal received thousands of dollars per procedure, but patients received simple devices which required no surgery. And all device placements used to take place at Aggarwal's clinic, not a hospital or surgical center. “A doctor who uses simple medical devices on his patients, yet bills Medicare for a sophisticated spinal surgery, is billing the American taxpayer, plain and simple,” said US Attorney Nicholas J Ganjei.. “The Southern District of Texas will ensure that losses to federally funded healthcare programs from fraudulent billing, like what happened here, are recouped and that wrongdoers are held accountable.”PollDoes the healthcare billing system need stricter monitoring to prevent fraud?YesNoA 2023 document of the DOJ revealed that earlier he was accused of giving unnecessary treatment to federal employees with federal workers' compensation benefits and his pharmacy Medley, which was officially owned by his wife, filed the prescriptions. An employee of Medley acted as a whistleblower and said that during his term of employment, he saw patients being sent unnecessary with unnecessary medications being prescribed. In some cases, the patients did not even see or meet Dr Aggarwal. And Medley employees were allegedly instructed to auto-fill medications on a monthly basis and to use pre-printed prescription pads to submit the prescriptions to DOL-OWCP without consideration of medical need. The new fraud of Dr Aggarwal came to be reported at a time when foreign doctors are under fire, while several Republican leaders said US needs more doctors and foreign doctors can fill the gap.

Indian-origin foreign nationals holding an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card could now lose it if they face serious criminal charges or convictions, the government has announced.In a fresh gazette notification, the ministry of home affairs said that the OCI registration will be cancelled if the holder is sentenced to imprisonment for two years or more, or is named in a charge sheet for an offence carrying a jail term of seven years or more."In exercise of the powers conferred by the clause (da) of section 7D of the Citizenship Act, 1955 (57 of 1955), the central government hereby states that an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) registration shall be liable to get cancelled when a person has been sentenced to imprisonment for term of not less than two years or has been charge-sheeted for an offence entailing punishment of imprisonment for seven years or more," the notification said, as cited by PTI.PollShould stricter rules be applied to Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) cardholders?NoYesThe OCI card allows Indian-origin foreign nationals to visit India without a visa. The scheme, introduced in August 2005, enables registration as OCI for all persons of Indian origin who were citizens of India on January 26, 1950 or later, or were eligible to become citizens on that date, except for those who are, or have been, citizens of Pakistan, Bangladesh or any other country specified by the government in the official gazette.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Indian-origin Dr Vinay Prasad returns to FDA weeks after exit
Dr Vinay Prasad, previously ousted from his FDA vaccine chief position due to criticism from Laura Loomer over past anti-Trump comments and drug approval decisions, has been reinstated. This unusual move suggests the influence of RFK Jr within the Trump administration despite pressure from right-wing activists. RFK Jr opposed anti-vaxxer Dr Prasad's exit and remained invested to bring him back.

This unusual move suggests the influence of RFK Jr within the Trump administration despite pressure from right-wing activists. RFK Jr opposed anti-vaxxer Dr Prasad's exit and remained invested to bring him back.  Dr Vinay Prasad is back at his FDA job weeks after exit that was prompted by right-wing activist Laura Loomer's campaigning against Prasad. Dr Vinay Prasad, the Indian-origin vaccine chief of the FDA who was forced to resign in July after far-right activist Laura Loomer led a campaign against him, has been reinstated to his job in an unusual instance. Laura Loomer pointed out the critical comments that Dr Prasad made about President Donald Trump before joining the administration, while some of his decisions to deny drug approvals also came under fire. A Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson confirmed to the New York Times that Dr Prasad is returning to the agency. “At the F.D.A.’s request, Dr. Vinay Prasad is resuming leadership of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research,” Andrew Nixon, a health department spokesman, said in a statement.The NYT report observed that Dr Prasad's rehiring suggests that the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr., and the FDA commissioner, Dr Marty Makary, remain influential enough in the Trump administration to employ someone who had previously expressed disdain for Trump and his followers.Loomer reacted to the reinstatement and called in another "egregious personnel decision". "In another egregious personnel decision under the Trump administration, it is now being reported that longtime progressive Marxist Vinay Prasad who referred to President Trump’s supporters as criminals and compared them to drug addicts after saying he stabbed a Trump voodoo doll to “curse Trump” is apparently back at FDA," Loomer wrote.RFK Jr tapped Dr Prasad in May when the previous head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation left the role. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Dr Prasad gained prominence as an outspoken critic of vaccines and mask mandate. In his short stint at the FDA since May, Dr Prasad limited the use of Covid-19 vaccines and promoted warnings about a rare side effect of the vaccines. When he resigned from his role weeks ago, a department spokesperson told the NYT: "Dr. Prasad did not want to be a distraction to the great work of the FDA in the Trump administration and has decided to return to California and spend more time with his family."Kennedy, however, opposed Prasad's departure from the role and remained invested in bringing him back. Dr Prasad was born and brought up in Ohio and Chicago to Indian immigrant parents.

An Indian-origin techie, Manasi Mishra, who graduated with a computer science degree from Purdue University, revealed in a TikTok video as she was getting ready that the only company that called her for an interview was Chipotle. Titled 'Chipotle Interview GRWM', the TikTok video went viral as she appealed 'somebody pls hire me'. In an interview with New York Times, after the video went viral, Mishra revealed that growing up near Silicon Valley, she was used to the narrative that if she learned to code, worked hard and studied computer science, she could get a six-figure starting salary. But recent graduates are finding it hard because of the spread of AI programming tools and also the recent layoffs at companies like Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft.The NYT story confirmed that Mishra did not get the burrito-making gig at Chipotle, and she finally found a sales position job at a tech company.Mishra's story and the NYT article triggered a major debate on the present job situation, layoff and how much of it should be blamed on foreign workers, AI etc. "This is why I really do feel for Gen Z. This young woman was told her whole life by every authority figure that she should study hard, do well in school, and pursue a career in tech. She went to Purdue, one of the best engineering schools in the country. She studied computer science, not gender ideology or basket weaving," one viral comment read on X. "And still she could not even get a job at Chipotle let alone in her field. She did literally everything “right” but, to what end? This situation is not sustainable. H1B and other work visas, as well as offshoring, are getting out of control and abusive. Policymakers should care about the young generation," the person wrote. Many people commented that the jobs that the Indian-origin person missed must have gone to people from India who are on H-1B.

(Photo: DailyEcho/Padharo) Ankit Vaghela, an Indian-origin restaurant owner in Southampton, was told by the police that they could not come to his 'Padharo' when he called 999 to report a break-in. The vandals broke in and fled with several bottles of expensive alcohol and cash but the police helpline asked them to email the CCTV footage of the three burglars who broke in last week.Vaghela decided to get proactive and review the footage first. He discovered his cash register without the cash, abandoned along with some smashed liquor bottles strewn on a nearby road. “It was very heartbreaking to be told that officers will be able to review the damage in three to five working days and that no forensics was available at the time,” said Vaghela.“There was glass everywhere. As a business, we can’t afford to remain closed and had to get things cleaned up and the glass fixed. We are still struggling to operate smoothly without a proper cash register, which will take time, but are determined to welcome our guests with the same level of service we are known for in the city,” he said.The Hampshire Police said they did not underestimate the July 31 case but they understood that their investigation could start without their immediate attendance at the site, as the offenders were not there. “Every deployment decision is based on informed risk assessments to make sure the most serious cases are prioritised, and officers are on scene where there is an immediate threat to life or a crime in action,” the police force said in a statement.“On this occasion, based on the initial information we were given regarding the offenders no longer being at the scene, our investigation could get underway without any immediate attendance.

In a separate incident, Laxman Das, an Indian sous chef in Dublin, was attacked and robbed while going to work. These incidents follow a series of recent assaults targeting Indians in Ireland, raising concerns about racism.  TOI correspondent from London: A six-year-old Indian-origin girl and an Indian sous chef are the latest victims in the ongoing spate of racist attacks targeting Indian nationals and Indian-origin Irish people in Ireland.The girl, whose family hail from Kottayam, Kerala, was playing outside her house in Waterford City, southeast Ireland, with friends at 7.30pm on Monday evening when a gang of boys and one girl called her a “dirty Indian” and told her to “go back to India”. She was born in Ireland. Five of the gang also punched her in the face, hit her private parts with a bicycle, punched her neck and twisted her hair.Her mother moved to Ireland eight years ago from Kottayam to work as a nurse with her husband and recently became an Irish citizen.The mother said the gang was made up of boys aged 12 to 14 and a girl aged eight. She said her daughter came home in floods of tears and is now too scared to play outside. She told the Irish Mirror: “I never expected that such an incident would happen. I thought she would be safe here. Even in front of our own house she can’t play safely. I am a nurse, I am doing my best to take care of people. I do my work and I am 100% professional. I changed my citizenship, but still we are called dirty people and even my kids are not safe. We came here to fill a labour gap. We are professionals — we have all the certificates…”The mother studied BSc Nursing at University of Calicut and went to Mount Carmel Higher Secondary School in Kottayam.“Gardaí (Irish national police) responded to a report of an alleged assault in the Kilbarry area of Waterford city on the evening of Monday 4 August. Investigations are ongoing,” a Garda spokesperson told TOI.On Wednesday morning Laxman Das from Kolkata, who works as a sous chef at the Anantara The Marker Dublin hotel, was assaulted near the Hilton Hotel by three people while on his way to work. He was taken to St Vincent's University Hospital. His phone, cash and electric bike were stolen.These come following a spate of attacks against Indians in Ireland in recent weeks — on July 19, July 24, July 27, and on Aug 1 when a cab driver was assaulted.The Gardaí said they are still investigating these attacks and no one has been arrested.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning looks of Binny Sebastiantv10 baby names that mean ‘divine light’ or ‘sacred glow’Lifestyle10 Birds with the "wildest dating rituals"LifestyleRaksha Bandhan: 10 iconic lines of famous Hindi poets that capture essence of the festivalLifestyleKarishma Tanna Stuns with Style and SpiritEntertainmentFrom Moong to Chia Sprouts: How to grow your breakfast in balconyLifestyleBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Here’s how much each contestant earns dailytv10 creatures that survive in the deepest parts of the oceanLifestyleRaksha Bandhan: 10 quotes that describe the beautiful bond between brothers and sistersLifestyleHow to do step-by-step Ayurveda hair therapy at homeLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Threads of Love, Threads of Tradition: How different Indian states celebrate Raksha BandhanFrom chapatis to cake: 7 delicious ways to use overripe bananasInternational Cat Day 2025: From Persian to Bengal Cat-- 5 most beautiful and popular pet cat breeds in the world5 diseases moles on your body might indicate and should not be ignoredNot-so popular drinks that help in weightloss10 places in South Africa that aren’t to be missed in a lifetimeMemorable style outings of Princess CharlotteHow Kangana Ranaut turned fame into fearless politicsFrom ₹6 Lakh to ₹40 Lakh: A peek into Kamal Haasan’s ultra-luxe watch closetFrom Archana reacting to a hate comment to son Aaryamann revealing how he impressed girlfriend Yogita Bihani: Archana Puran Singh shares candid moments123Hot PicksGlobal Standard indexUS stocks todayIndia-US tariffIntel CEOMukesh AmbaniUS jobless dataRussia crude oilTop TrendingTom BradyDonald TrumpSouth Park EpisodeCall of DutyMalik BeasleyBattlefield 6 Beta OpensPrivate School in IndianaLuka Doncic Weight LossLinda McMahonLakers RumorsTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteUAE launches national programme to train Emiratis in space mission design and satellite engineering'PM Modi can't, shouldn't bend knee to Donald Trump': US tariffs on India draws rare bipartisan concern in US - watch'Enormous mistake': What Trump's former NSA John Bolton said on India tariffChild assault under false identity: Indian man commits suicide in US jail months after 35-year prison sentence, claim reportsLove gone wild: Indian man faces deportation for harassing UK zoo colleague for 6 months; didn’t stop even after restraining order'Before judging...': Wife of Pakistani man Salman Iftikhar who threatened Virgin Atlantic air hostess with gangrape defends outburstFriedrich Merz halts German military exports to Israel over Gaza issue; urges aid accessGround invasion in Gaza?

The arrest occurred due to possession of a fake resident card. Authorities took him into custody in Niagara Falls, New York. He faces a potential 10-year prison sentence. The arrest is part of 'Operation Take Back America'. This initiative targets illegal immigration.  An Indian national has been arrested in the United States for allegedly possessing a forged alien resident card, according to the Justice Department. Swapnil Ramesh Tejale, 34, was taken into custody following a traffic stop in Niagara Falls, New York, and now faces a federal charge that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.“On July 10, 2025, the Niagara Falls Border Patrol Station received a request from the Niagara Falls Police Department to help identify three individuals that they had encountered during a traffic stop,” said Assistant US Attorney Michael J. Smith, who is prosecuting the case. “Agents arrived at the scene and questioned the three individuals as to their citizenship. Tejale presented a Lawful Permanent Resident Card but voluntarily admitted that the card was fictitious.”Authorities later confirmed that Tejale was in the country unlawfully and did not possess any valid immigration documents. Following his arrest, agents discovered a Social Security card in his name, which was also found to be counterfeit.The case falls under “Operation Take Back America”, a Justice Department initiative aimed at tackling illegal immigration and dismantling transnational criminal organisations. The operation seeks to “repel the invasion of illegal immigration” and “protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime”, the department said.The investigation was led by the US Border Patrol Niagara Falls Station, under the direction of Patrol Agent in Charge Brady Waikal.Tejale’s arrest is part of a series of immigration enforcement actions involving Indian nationals this year. In a related incident, an Indian man from Santa Rosa, California, was sentenced in March to six months in prison for conspiracy to transport aliens for profit. Meanwhile, Manjot Singh, a 25-year-old Indian national, was recently arrested in the Seattle area for repeat offences including robbery, assault, and criminal impersonation. Singh, who entered the U.S. illegally, is currently in ICE custody pending deportation.ICE officials have said that Singh’s arrest is a warning to repeat offenders: “Those who violate US laws while in the country illegally face arrest and deportation.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Viral footage shows firefighters inspecting the scene as the family performed the ritual. (Photo: X) A housewarming ceremony involving a Hindu havan at a Texas home took an unexpected turn when local firefighters arrived at the scene, mistaking the ritual for a fire emergency.The incident was captured on video. The footage has gone viral and has fuelled an online debate over cultural awareness and fire safety. The clip was originally shared on Instagram. It shows a fire truck from the Bedford fire department pulling up outside the house as smoke from the ceremony fills the garage. Inside, an Indian family can be seen performing a traditional havan, a religious ritual involving fire, as part of their housewarming puja.The video includes on-screen text stating, "Cultural misunderstanding 101: A Hindu puja is not a fire emergency. When you're having a housewarming havan and the fire department pulls up."Shortly after the fire crew arrives, they are seen speaking with members of the family and inspecting the area. However, it remains unclear whether any formal action was taken or if any fire codes were violated during the ritual.The footage has since been widely circulated across social media platforms, with users offering differing views on the incident. Some social media users criticised the family for conducting a ritual involving fire in a residential setting, arguing it could pose safety risks.

Indian-origin Mathura Sridharan was appointed as Ohio's 12th solicitor general, inviting the wrath of online trolls who questioned why a 'non-US-origin' person was not picked for the post. Sridharan's LinkedIn went viral as critics questioned her credibility -- forcing Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost to issue a clarification, or a clapback at the trolls. Dave Yost, who announced Mathura's promotion, said Mathura is wrongly being portrayed as a non-American. "A few commenters have asserted incorrectly that Mathura is not American. She is a United States citizen, married to a US citizen, and the child of naturalized US citizens," he said. "If her name or her complexion bother you, the problem is not with her or her appointment," he added."Mathura is brilliant… she won her argument at SCOTUS last year. Both the SGs she worked under (Flowers & Gaiser) recommended her. I told her when I originally hired her I needed her to argue with me. She does… All the time! Excited to promote her. She will serve Ohio well," Yost wrote.Yost's clapback also met trolling as people commented that she is not "American-American". "Is she a Christian? That’s the biggest factor that concerns me. Based on the bindi on her forehead, I worry she is not," one wrote. "Another American job… given away to foreigners," another wrote. "She's Indian. They all have a loyalty first to other Indians. horrible pick. Totally un-American. the GOP is pathetic," a third user wrote."No one with the last name 'Sridharan' fought in the US Civil War. She's not an American," another wrote.Before joining the Ohio Solicitor’s Office, Mathura clerked for Judge Steven J. Menashi of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and Judge Deborah A. Batts of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. She holds a Juris Doctor from New York University School of Law, a Master’s Degree in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as a Bachelor’s Degree in Economics and in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Following Nikhil Ravishankar's appointment as Air New Zealand's CEO, media outlets in New Zealand disabled social media comments due to a surge of racist remarks targeting his Indian ethnicity.

News organizations like New Zealand Herald, Radio New Zealand, and 1News cited their inability to moderate the hateful content as the reason for shutting down comments.   After Indian-origin Nikhil Ravishankar was appointed as the new chief executive of Air New Zealand, the country's media said they had to disable comments on social media as there was a barrage of racist remarks targeting Ravishankar's ethnicity. Ravishankar was the chief digital officer of Air New Zealand before getting the major promotion which is the first for an Indian-origin person in the country.New Zealand Herald, Radio New Zealand, 1News said they had to disable comments as they can't allow hatred. The New Zealand Herald issued a statement in which it clarified that there were several racist comments owing to which they had to take the extreme step. "We appreciate the high level of interest in this story but cannot safely moderate it at this time," the news outlet said in a post in the comment thread."We want to foster a safe online community by reducing instances of hate, racism, abuse and misinformation. We welcome your feedback on articles but there has to be some parameters, and these are explained in our community house rules...We cannot tolerate hate. We cannot tolerate abuse towards individuals in our stories or other commenters," the company's social media policy says. Radio New Zealand had to do the same on the social media post on Ravishankar's appointment. "Under RNZ's comments policy, we will proactively disable comments on posts which may attract abusive or harmful comments or when resources are required elsewhere," a spokesperson for RNZ said. "In this instance, the comments were disabled after our monitoring found racist comments," the spokesperson said. "We want people to feel safe and respected on our community forums and will continue to proactively disable comments where necessary. We will not tolerate harmful communications."1News said it received a large number of comments on the post that announced Ravishankar's appointment and a vast majority were inappropriate. Who is Nikhil Ravishankar?Nikhil Ravishankar was born in India but brought up in New Zealand. He studied in New Zealand -- holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) from the University of Auckland. Before joining Air New Zealand, Ravishankar was Chief Digital Officer at Vector New Zealand (from 2017), and also worked as a Managing Director at Accenture across Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand, and in senior technology roles at Spark (formerly Telecom NZ).About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

After her TikTok video went viral, another ICE official offered help. Chatterjee highlights the broader issue of poor ICE communication, impacting immigrants facing detention and difficult bond policies, leading some to abandon their asylum claims. Trisha Chatterjee (Picture source: LinkedIn) Trisha Chatterjee, an Indian-origin immigration lawyer in Ohio, has alleged she was given the number of a Taco Bell outlet when she called ICE for urgent client support. Chatterjee posted about the incident on TikTok, where it went viral and ultimately led to help from another ICE official. But she says the larger issue lack of clear access to immigration authorities continues to cause serious harm to her clients."I called and they answered and they said, 'Hello, Taco Bell?' And I said, 'Taco Bell?' And the guy who was working said, 'Yeah, Taco Bell. Ma'am, you called me," Chatterjee recalled."I was in such disbelief," she said. "So, I called the ICE officer back, just really frustrated with what had just happened. He says, 'Oh, I'm sorry. I was trying to lighten the mood and make you laugh.'"ICE has denied the accusation. Homeland security called it a “lie and a smear.” Chatterjee stood by her version of events.Who is Trisha Chatterjee? Trisha Chatterjee is an Indian-origin immigration lawyer based in Greater Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio. She graduated from Miami University in 2020 and the University of Dayton School of Law in 2023.She works with the law office of Emily Feliz Garcia, a small immigration firm in Springdale. Before this, she worked at Abdallah law offices.For the last two years, she has handled immigration cases, especially those involving clients detained at the Butler County Jail in Ohio, which has a contract with ICE.Chatterjee was trying to submit "stay of removal" applications—urgent paperwork that can pause deportation for clients with pending immigration cases. ICE requires these to be submitted in person at the Detroit field office, but she hoped to file them locally in Blue Ash.After being unable to reach anyone by phone or email, she finally spoke to an ICE officer who gave her a phone number that turned out to be for Taco Bell. When she called back, the officer reportedly said he was trying to make her laugh.She posted a video about the incident on TikTok, which gained over 38,000 views. Many users sympathised, and one even helped her connect with a helpful ICE official in Blue Ash, who is now assisting her.Chatterjee said the larger problem is the lack of access and communication with ICE. She also highlighted how a stricter bond policy is making it harder for immigrants to stay out of detention during legal proceedings. Bonds can cost up to $50,000 and must be paid upfront.According to Chatterjee, some clients are abandoning their asylum cases or choosing to self-deport out of fear. She mentioned recent local arrests of people attending ICE check-ins, which has only deepened anxiety in immigrant communities.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The alleged abuse occurred in Contra Costa County, according to the district attorney’s office.Jennifer Powell, 45, has also been charged with 24 counts in a related felony complaint. Both Bhagwagar and Powell are being held at the Martinez detention facility. Bhagwagar’s bail has been set at $15 million.The charges in both cases carry possible prison terms of 15 years to life. Bhagwagar is expected to be arraigned Wednesday in Martinez, California.“Our office stands firmly committed to protecting children and holding those who cause harm accountable,” said Contra Costa county district attorney Diana Becton in a statement. “Every child deserves to feel safe, protected and heard when an injustice like this occurs.”According to the Contra Costa county sheriff’s office, detectives had been investigating Bhagwagar since April. His arrest was made with the assistance of Homeland Security Investigations after a warrant was issued.A short video published by aviation blog View From the Wing shows officers with badges exiting the plane’s cockpit.Delta Air Lines released a statement saying it was “appalled by reports of the charges related to the arrest” and confirmed that Bhagwagar had been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation. “Delta has zero tolerance for unlawful conduct,” the airline said.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani faces criticism for visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam due to his past support for defunding the police. Critics accuse Mamdani of shifting his stance for political gain, especially after his 2020 tweets resurfaced. Mamdani defends his actions, clarifying his current position on public safety and police funding. Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is facing backlash after visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam, as critics pointed to his past 2020 tweet supporting "defund the police" stance.The controversy erupted after Mamdani, who recently returned from a trip to Uganda, visited the grieving family of officer Islam, one of four victims killed in a mass shooting in Midtown Manhattan. Zohran Mamdani’s SECRET Wedding Triggers Fury Amid Local Tragedy | WATCHThe shooter, Shane Tamura, opened fire on Monday, killing Islam and three others before shooting himself.Sharing a post on X, Mamdani wrote: “Two days ago, an act of senseless violence took the lives of Officer Didarul Islam, Wesley LePatner, Aland Etienne, and Julia Hyman. Today, I visited Officer Islam's family and learned of his legacy. I ask you to join me in honoring the memory of these four New Yorkers.”However, the post quickly drew criticism, with users referencing Mamdani’s previous tweets during the height of the “Defund the Police” movement in 2020.Many accused him of changing his stance for political gain. One user wrote, “You can't go from defund the police to never mind I love the police. You're asking New Yorkers to forgo their guns meanwhile you just had a wedding in Uganda with armed guards.”While another posted, “Zohran Mamdani exposed as a total fraud. Mocking cops, calling them racist, then acting like he cares? No loyalty to America. He belongs in Uganda, not leading NYC. Deport him and protect our city!”Earlier at a press conference following his visit to the officer’s home in The Bronx, Mamdani addressed the criticism and attempted to clarify his position saying: “I am not defunding the police; I am not running to defund the police.”“Over the course of this race, I’ve been very clear about my view of public safety and the critical role that the police have in creating that public safety,” he added.Standing alongside members of the Bangladeshi American Police Association—of which Officer Islam was a member—and labor union 32BJ, which represented another victim, Aland Etienne, Mamdani tried to strike a unifying tone.During the peak of the "Defund the Police" movement in 2020, Zohran Mamdani repeatedly called for major cuts to the NYPD budget. In one post, he wrote, “We don’t need an investigation to know that the NYPD is racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety. What we need is to #DefundTheNYPD.”In another, he said, “There is no negotiating with an institution this wicked & corrupt. Defund it. Dismantle it. End the cycle of violence,” referencing budget talks around proposed NYPD cuts.Now, Mamdani has distanced himself from those remarks. When asked about them, he responded, “My statements in 2020 were made amidst a frustration that many New Yorkers held at the murder of George Floyd.”Mamdani claimed that his current stance is more nuanced, stating that his previous posts were “clearly out of step” with his recent campaign platform. He now supports maintaining the NYPD headcount while reducing its overtime budget.Despite this clarification, skepticism remains. Many police officers and political observers have accused Mamdani of shifting positions purely for political gain in a city where public safety remains a top concern for voters, New York Post reported.Adding to the political firestorm, former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams, who are both trailing Mamdani in early polling for the 2025 mayoral race, weighed in shortly after the shooting. Mamdani fired back, accusing Cuomo of politicising the tragedy saying, “It is beyond me that politicians are looking to use these days to score such cynical political points, on the very day that I held the father of Officer Islam in my arms and he could not utter a single word.”“For the former governor to spend an entire day speaking almost exclusively about me and barely about the New Yorkers who have been killed is indicative of the very politics New Yorkers want to leave in the past,” he added.All three, Mamdani, Cuomo, and Adams are expected to attend officer Islam’s funeral on Thursday.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The high court found him guilty of rape and outrage of modesty, following incidents at his Jurong West shop in 2021. Despite his denials and claims of erectile dysfunction, the judge deemed the victim's testimony credible.  An Indian national was sentenced to more than 14 years in jail on Thursday by the Singapore high court for sexually assaulting a minor, reports the Straits Times.Ramalingam Selvasekaran was handed a sentence of 14 years, three months and two weeks after being found guilty of rape and two counts of outrage of modesty after assaulting an 11-year-old at his provision shop in Jurong West.According to the court, the assaults occurred between 4.50 pm and 5.05 pm on October 28, 2021. The girl had visited Ramalingam’s store and returned later to buy ice cream. Prosecutors said he led her into a back area and forced her to perform oral sex. After the incident, the girl sought help from a passerby, who called the police.Ramalingam represented himself during the trial, which began on January 16. He was convicted on all charges on 7 July.“The fact that she had not run off after the first act of molest, or that she did not resist the assaults, or inform her grandfather, were all to my mind sufficiently explained, particularly given that she was still young and immature,” said Justice Aidan Xu, who found the girl’s account credible and consistent.Ramalingam’s earlier statements to police reportedly included admissions of hugging, kissing, and oral sex. However, he later denied any wrongdoing, claiming he was suffering from erectile dysfunction and that no DNA evidence was found on the victim.The judge ruled that these claims did not undermine the girl’s testimony. “While there was no dispute that Ramalingam suffered from erectile dysfunction, the prosecution’s expert witness gave a cogent explanation that oral rape remained possible,” Justice Xu was quoted as saying to Straits Times.Following sentencing on July 30, Ramalingam said he would appeal and was granted bail of S$80,000. He attempted to negotiate with the judge over the conditions, asking for the removal of his electronic tag and exemption from reporting to the Police Cantonment Complex. Both requests were denied.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The incidents, condemned by authorities and community leaders, are being treated as linked. This follows a separate racist assault in Adelaide, where an Indian man was brutally attacked after being told to "f--- off, Indian."  A Hindu temple in Melbourne’s eastern suburb of Boronia was defaced with racist graffiti this week prompting widespread condemnation and police investigation.As reported by The Brisbane Times and The Sydney Morning Herald, offensive red graffiti with the words “Go home” and other racial slurs were found daubed across the Shree Swaminarayan Temple on Wadhurst Drive, as well as two nearby Asian-operated restaurants Kingsland Chinese Restaurant and Charles King Dumpling.Police said a healing centre on Mountain Highway was also defaced the same night, bringing the total number of sites attacked to four. “There is absolutely no place at all in our society for hate-based and racist behaviour,” Victoria Police said in a statement. Authorities confirmed that all four incidents are being treated as linked and that an investigation is under way.PollShould harsher penalties be implemented for hate crimes?Yes, definitelyNo, current laws are sufficient'An attack on our right to worship'Makrand Bhagwat, President of the Hindu Council of Australia’s Victoria chapter, told Australia Today the vandalism of the temple was “heartbreaking” for the community. “Our temple is meant to be a sanctuary of peace, devotion and unity,” he said. “To have it targeted in this way feels like an attack on our identity, our right to worship and freedom of religion.”Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan sent a personal message of support to temple management. “What happened this week was hateful, racist and deeply disturbing,” she wrote. “It wasn’t just vandalism – it was a deliberate act of hate, designed to intimidate, isolate, and spread fear.”Local interfaith networks, including the City of Greater Knox’s Multifaith Network, have expressed support. “We want to show that love and solidarity triumph over hate,” said community leader Vikrant Thakur.Indian man targeted in racist attackThis came after a 23-year-old Indian man, Charanpreet Singh, was brutally attacked and left unconscious on a street in Adelaide following a reported racist assault linked to a parking dispute. According to 9News, the men allegedly told Singh to "f--- off, Indian" before launching a violent, unprovoked assault.“They just said ‘f--- off, Indian’, and after that they just started punching,” Singh said. “I tried to fight back, but they beat me until I was unconscious.”He sustained serious injuries, including brain trauma and facial fractures. A 20-year-old from Enfield was arrested and charged, but others involved remain at large.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Singh and his wife were allegedly ambushed by a group of men who shouted racial slurs before inflicting serious injuries. The incident has sparked outrage and renewed calls for enhanced safety measures for international students in the area.  An Indian international student has been hospitalised with serious injuries after a violent assault in Australia's Adelaide that is being investigated as a possible racially motivated attack. The incident has sparked outrage across the Indian community and renewed calls for better safety measures for international students.Charanpreet Singh, 23, was with his wife near Kintore Avenue on Saturday evening (July 19) when they were allegedly ambushed by a group of five men. According to Australia Today, the couple had just parked their car to view the city’s light displays around 9:22pm when the attackers emerged from another vehicle.Viral video shows assaultEyewitnesses and video footage shared on social media reportedly show the men striking Singh with what appeared to be metal knuckles or sharp objects, while shouting racial abuse including: “F--- off, Indian”. The attackers then fled the scene, leaving Singh unconscious and seriously injured on the road.PollWhat should be prioritized to improve safety for international students?Awareness campaigns and community supportStronger law enforcement and quicker actionSingh, who spoke to 9News from his hospital bed, said the altercation began over a car parking dispute but escalated into a racially charged assault. “They just said, ‘F--- off, Indian,’ and after that they just started punching,” he recalled. “You can change anything in your body, but you can’t change the colours.”He sustained facial fractures and brain trauma, and was taken by emergency services to the Royal Adelaide Hospital for overnight treatment. The assault has left members of the local Indian community shaken, with many expressing solidarity with Singh online.“When things like this happen, it makes you feel like you should go back,” Singh said.Police investigation under waySouth Australia Police confirmed they were called to Kintore Avenue shortly before 9.30pm and found Singh with facial injuries. “He was taken to hospital for treatment. Investigations are continuing,” a police spokesperson told The Indian Sun. One man, a 20-year-old from Enfield, has been arrested and charged with assault causing harm. The other suspects remain at large.Authorities are reviewing CCTV footage from the area and have urged witnesses to come forward. “We ask anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers,” the police said.Premier Peter Malinauskas has condemned the incident, calling it “completely unwelcome in our state”. He added, “Any time we see any evidence of any racial attack, it is just not consistent with where the majority of our community are at.”Another attack in DublinThis follows another attack targeting an Indian individual. An Indian man in his 40s was hospitalised after being brutally attacked by a group of teenage boys in a violent, racist assault in Dublin on Saturday evening. The gang falsely accused him of inappropriate behaviour with children before beating him and pulling down his trousers. “Gardaí in Tallaght were alerted to an incident at Parkhill Road... Investigations are ongoing,” police said. Councillor Baby Pereppadan said, “He couldn’t speak much because of the shock.” Sinn Féin’s Seán Crowe added, “You are sowing hate, fear, and division.” A protest is planned for July 26 to condemn rising racist violence in Ireland.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Arjun Tendulkar’s fiancée Saaniya Chandhok with future sister-in-law Sara Tendulkar in an old video (Screengrab via Instagram/@saratendulkar) A resurfaced social media post has offered a glimpse into the long-standing friendship between Sara Tendulkar and Saaniya Chandok, who is now engaged to Sara’s brother, Arjun Tendulkar. The video, shared by Sara in October 2024, appears to be from a girls’ trip. Captioned “table for three”, it features Sara, Saaniya and a friend showing off their outfits and enjoying different locations. The clip, now in the spotlight after the news of Saaniya's engagement with Arjun Tendulkar, highlights how close Saaniya has been to the Tendulkar family long before her engagement. That bond has now taken on a new meaning, with Arjun Tendulkar and Saaniya Chandok formalising their relationship earlier this week. The 25-year-old cricketer, son of Sachin Tendulkar, got engaged to 26-year-old Saaniya on August 13 in a private ceremony attended by close friends and family. Saaniya, the granddaughter of businessman Ravi Ghai, comes from a family deeply connected to India’s food and hospitality industry. The Ghai family runs the Graviss Group, which manages Baskin Robbins’ India operations and owns The Brooklyn Creamery. Graviss Food Solutions Private Limited reported ₹624 crore in revenue for FY23-24. Fans have also been given a rare look at the Tendulkars’ personal celebrations through recent Instagram photos. The images show Sachin Tendulkar performing a pooja alongside his wife Anjali, daughter Sara, son Arjun and future daughter-in-law Saaniya. The intimate family gathering, has further showcased the growing bond between the two families. Sara recently launched a pilates academy in Andheri, Mumbai.  The age gap between Arjun and Saaniya, a little over a year, has already drawn attention online, drawing comparisons to Sachin Tendulkar’s own marriage. The cricket icon married Anjali in 1995 despite her being five years older.PollDo you believe age differences matter in relationships?Yes, they can be significantNo, it doesn't matterIt depends on the individuals For now, though, the focus remains on the Tendulkars’ newest chapter. From old trip videos to quiet family rituals, glimpses of Arjun and Saaniya’s journey together are steadily emerging, and cricket fans are taking note.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

I asked him what kind of meat is available here. He told me about the different kinds of meat. Then I asked if dog meat was available. Afridi was sitting right there. Razzaq was shocked to hear this and said, 'Hey Irfan, why are you saying this?'" Pathan said on Lallantop.PollDo you believe that verbal exchanges in sports can impact performance?Yes, they can motivate playersNo, they are just distractionsIt depends on the player"I said, 'He (Afridi) has eaten dog meat, he has been barking for a long time.'"After that, Afridi couldn’t say anything. Whatever he might have said, I would have just replied, 'Look, he is barking again.' After this, he remained silent throughout the flight."From this incident, he understood that he could not win against me verbally. That’s why he never said anything to me again," he added.Pathan, who had immense success against Pakistan in his career — taking 67 wickets and scoring 807 runs, including a century — revealed what led to the verbal altercation."Afridi came and placed his hand on my head, messing up my hair.

He would try to imitate his walk, his cover drive, his celebration, and even played most of his early career with a red handkerchief tucked in his trousers.Around 8,782 kilometers from Mohali, in Pretoria, in the Brevis’ backyard, Dewald and his elder brother Reinardt, wearing Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers’ Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) jerseys, used to mimic both the legends with match simulations -- imagining themselves pulling off a heist for RCB.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Brevis has had a similar trajectory to Gill. Like Gill, he was portrayed as the next “prince.”Both of them hit a wall. Form deserted them, critics came out with swords, but their heroes stood like rocks and kept backing them. Back in 2019, when Gill first entered the Indian dressing room in New Zealand, Kohli famously said: “I saw him bat in the nets and I was like 'wow -- I was not even 10 percent of that when I was 19.'”Similarly, De Villiers also helped Brevis in his early days. “I have been his mentor for about two years now and helped him with his batting and his attitude towards cricket,” De Villiers had told Netwerk24 in 2022, when the youngster burst onto the scene in the U19 World Cup.In the last couple of months, Gill, the anointed prince, found his feet in Test cricket, smashing 754 runs in his first Test series as captain. It was Kohli again who wrote a special message for his successor at No. 4: “Well played star boy. Rewriting history. Onwards and upwards from here. You deserve all this,” Kohli wrote after Gill scored a sublime 269 and 161 at Edgbaston.Likewise, earlier this week, when Brevis smoked a 41-ball hundred against Australia, De Villiers went gung-ho over his countryman’s knock and took a shot at the IPL teams, saying: “The boy can play.”What changed for Gill and Brevis?Before Shubman Gill was appointed Team India’s Test captain, he wanted to prove himself in England. He practiced with the red Dukes, worked on his trigger movement, and sought help from his cricket-tragic father Lakhwinder Singh Gill.Gill Sr. reminded the youngster why he was such a prolific run-scorer at the age-group level and in the Ranji Trophy, and asked him to “go back to the basics.” A confident Shubman even predicted that he wanted to be the best batter in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, and boy, did he walk the talk.Dewald Brevis with his childhood coach Deon Botes. (Special Arrangement)For Dewald Brevis, it was his childhood coach Deon Botes -- who has played a massive role in the development of several South African cricketers, including AB de Villiers and Faf du Plessis.Botes, an Economics professor and former Director of Sport at Afrikaans Hoër Seunskool, more popularly known as Affies, shared how the child prodigy battled his dark phase and turned it around.“He went back to his basics. So, I think with the T20 game, he might have gone a bit loose technically,” Botes told TimesofIndia.com.PollWho do you think has a brighter future in cricket, Shubman Gill or Dewald Brevis?Shubman GillDewald BrevisBoth have equal potentialNeither will make a significant impact“In T20 cricket, obviously power hitting plays a big role. And I think he got a bit stuck with that. Playing a bit more red-ball cricket in the domestic league, I think, helped him just to fine-tune his technique a bit. So, it just looks like the old Dewald Brevis that we knew. I think he’s basically gone back to what he knows works, and it’s been successful for him.”Brevis’ redemptionLast year, after Christmas, Brevis called Botes asking for help.“So, last year, on the 28th of December, he came back to me and we worked for three days on his game again. Just going back to the basics, to what he was used to,” shared Botes.“He just wanted to get back to basics, which we did. And we basically gave him a clearer mind of what he wanted to do. A lot of people talk to you and there’s a lot of noise about you, and at times, you kind of lose track of what you actually want to do and what works for you.Dewald Brevis with coach Deon Botes at the Afrikaans Hoër Seunskool. (Special Arrangement)“So, he came back to me at the end of last year to just get back to his roots, back to the basics, and to find the right way for him to score. It was tough, but we had lots of conversations and lots of sessions to work through it.”When asked whether playing too much T20 cricket had corrupted Brevis’ technique, Botes said: “He really wanted to play cricket at the highest level and to show his skills and abilities. So, I think it was never about that for him.“He just wanted to play and score runs and be good. That’s basically all. Somewhere in this process, he might have got a bit confused about what he wanted to do. Like I said, there’s a lot of noise around playing like that, with people talking to him as a youngster. It’s probably difficult for him to work out who to listen to and who not. But he can’t listen to everybody. So when he came back to me, it was just about having one voice and going back to what works for him.”Dewald Brevis of South Africa bats during the T20 international cricket match between Australia and South Africa in Darwin, Australia, Tuesday, Aug. 12, 2025. (Jono Searle/AAPImage via AP)Botes feels his ward is ready to take all three formats by storm.“I think he can definitely play in all three formats for South Africa. He’s already played in two of them. So it’s just the 50-over game he hasn’t debuted in yet, but I think that will come now.“Yes, I think he’ll be successful in all three. I think Dewald would actually appreciate the long format, red-ball cricket. And I think he’s good enough to make it in all three formats,” he said.Make way for the Next GenEvery cricket lover has lived that moment, standing before a mirror, trying to mimic a hero’s batting stance or a bowler’s graceful run-up and release. Most imitations end in awkward copies, but a rare few manage to carry those borrowed styles all the way to the international stage. It’s the perfect embodiment of the saying: fake it till you make it.CAIRNS, AUSTRALIA - AUGUST 16:  Dewald Brevis of South Africa bats during game three of the Men's T20 International series between Australia and South Africa at Cazaly's Stadium on August 16, 2025 in Cairns, Australia. (Photo by Emily Barker/Getty Images)Experts often insist that a player’s trademark shot or bowling action is inimitable, something born of instinct and impossible to reproduce. Yet, some youngsters tune that noise out and keep practicing what inspires them.Take Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers, for instance. They have long been the blueprint for aspiring cricketers. And Shubman Gill and Dewald Brevis, their biggest admirers, seem to have unlocked that template. From cover drives to the lap shot, from the scoop to the front-foot punch, to the reverse sweep -- Gill and Brevis mirror the range of their idols with astonishing ease.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Phil Tufnell and Jack Russell of England (Images via Getty Images) Former England cricketer Phil Tufnell has revealed a rather unusual tactic once used by his wicketkeeper Jack Russell to unsettle opposition batters. In a light-hearted discussion, Tufnell said Russell would deliberately avoid brushing his teeth for a couple of days before a match. “My wicketkeeper, Jack Russell, didn’t use to brush his teeth for a couple of days. He said he wanted to put the batters off when he was standing up to the crease. Lots of little shenanigans go on there,” Tufnell revealed on BBC, leaving listeners amused at the extent wicketkeepers sometimes go to in order to gain an edge.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! The role of a wicketkeeper has often extended beyond just their skills with the gloves. They play a crucial part in controlling the energy on the field, especially through their chatter behind the stumps. Some use humour, some rely on constant encouragement, and others employ more unusual methods like sledging and as in this case - Russell’s tactic.29 Aug 1989:  Jack Russell of England waits behind the wicket during the Sixth Ashes Test match against Australia at the Kennington Oval in London. The match ended in a draw. (Credit: Adrian  Murrell/Allsport) West Indies all-rounder Carlos Brathwaite, also part of the discussion, underlined how wicketkeepers can influence the flow of a game. “Yeah, there are some that, when you’re batting, it’s just like, shut up. But as a bowler, you just love it. It brings a different energy. When you have a quiet keeper, it feels like the game takes so long,” Brathwaite said, pointing to how a vocal presence can lift a bowling side’s intensity.PollHow important is a wicketkeeper's chatter behind the stumps?Essential for team moraleHelpful but not crucialNot important at all From playful banter to strange personal routines, wicketkeepers often find their own ways to get under a batter’s skin and keep their teammates engaged.

With senior players retired, Gambhir is implementing his philosophy, prioritizing IPL talent and specialist players. He emphasizes impactful plays on every ball and values all-rounders for increased flexibility. LONDON, ENGLAND - JULY 30: India coach Gautam Gambhir speaks with captain Shubman Gill during a net session at The Kia Oval on July 30, 2025 in London, England. (Photo by Gareth Copley/Getty Images) New Delhi: Moments after India pulled off a miraculous draw in the fourth Test in Manchester last month, head coach Gautam Gambhir turned up at the press conference in his usual feisty avatar. It was the only Test during the two-month long tour in which India had been trailing England for almost four days. Gambhir wasn’t merely there to express his glee or relief. He was there to reiterate that those who doubted his strategies weren’t clued in. The coach feeds off the challenges thrown at him. In coming back from England with a 2-2 scoreline, he has been vindicated for some of the tough calls he took.The next six months, starting with the Asia Cup in UAE next month, will be the first time Gambhir will truly get to work on the T20I team for a period of time. Yet, the current T20I side is more his baby. His stint as India’s head coach started with Suryakumar Yadav being propelled to T20I captaincy ahead of Hardik Pandya. With Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli already retired from the format at the start of his stint, he could seamlessly drive home his philosophy in the dressing room. It didn’t matter if India were the new T20I world champions.Explained: Why The India-Pakistan Asia Cup Clash Cannot Be Cancelled Despite BacklashGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!“T20 World Cup, T20 side for India should be selected from IPL,” Gambhir said on former India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin’s YouTube channel just before assuming the role with the Indian team. Gambhir isn’t looking to rock the boat. But by now, it has been well established that he doesn’t mind dragging established names out of their comfort zones. He is rarely inhibited while giving more responsibility to unheralded cricketers — be it Suryakumar Yadav and Manish Pandey at KKR in 2014 or backing Ayush Badoni at Lucknow Super Giants.Much of Washington Sundar’s evolution as a Test allrounder is down to Gambhir’s unwavering backing. Gambhir swears by continuity. Despite all the talk of flexibility, he seeks stability at the top. The chatter in Indian cricket is that he would prefer an all format captain soon to build a common culture. Gambhir has been very clear with his vision. He walked in with an idea to rebrand the T20 team. India have often been accused of not being able to move with the times in the shortest format. Gambhir has decided to address it with players who can be branded as T20 specialists. He doesn’t mind if the pool swelled. That’s why Ramandeep Singh and Mayank Yadav were given their opportunities last year. India’s attacking brand of T20 cricket over the last 12 months is proof enough of how the Delhi man wants to go about his job.PollDo you believe Gautam Gambhir's strategies will lead India to success in T20 cricket?Yes, absolutelyNo, I have doubtsMaybe, it depends on executionI need more time to decideThis is the format that brought him recognition as a tactician. He won two IPL titles with KKR as a captain more than a decade ago before returning as a mentor in 2024 and delivering their third. He also stands out, being quite bullish about ‘results’ rather than process. Those who share the dressing room with Gambhir say that the coach loves breaking the game up into 120 balls rather than looking at it as a 20-over entity. ‘Every ball has to have an impact’ is his go-to phrase.There’s no room for getting comfortable. Roles are assigned as per skills, not batting numbers. He is comfortable with this facet of a modern-day T20 cricketer. Shivam Dube, for one, will always get preference since he can go up the order and blast the bowling if the openers get off to great starts. There are no designated finishers.Gambhir’s inclination towards having allrounders stems from the need to have more options. The Asia Cup may give us a glimpse of how he wants to go about his business in the next few months, but nothing is cast in stone yet. With the success in Champions Trophy and England, things have started to fall in place for Gambhir. Till the transition button is pressed in ODIs, it won’t be surprising to see a few unexpected moves in T20 cricket.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Obituary | Even when past his prime, Bobby Simpson always got the better of India
Bobby Simpson, who passed away at 89, made a remarkable comeback at 41 to captain Australia against India in 1977 after a nine-year retirement. Tasked with leading a team of newcomers due to Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket, Simpson not only captained with tactical brilliance but also topped the run charts, playing a crucial role in Australia's 3-2 series victory.

Tasked with leading a team of newcomers due to Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket, Simpson not only captained with tactical brilliance but also topped the run charts, playing a crucial role in Australia's 3-2 series victory. Legendary cricketer and World Cup-winning coach Bob Simpson dies at 89 Cricket was in chaos in 1977. Billionaire TV mogul Kerry Packer had lured Australia’s best, barring speed demon Jeff Thomson, for a never-before seen pro league cobbled from cricket’s reigning stars. The Australian board was forced to pull out a mothballed Bobby Simpson, then 41, to skipper the side against Bishan Singh Bedi’s touring India.The desperate decision turned out to be a masterstroke. Simpson, who passed away on Saturday at 89, not only skippered the squad filled with newbies with tactical acumen but also became the team’s leading run-scorer (539). Interestingly, he had played his last Test against MAK Pataudi’s India in 1968 and was making a comeback from retirement after nine long years.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!In the three Tests that Australia won of the five-match series, Simpson’s resolute batting was vital, indeed the difference between the two sides: 7 and 89 in Brisbane, 176 and 39 in Perth and 100 and 51 in Adelaide. In the two Tests he failed, Melbourne (2 and 4) and Sydney (38 and 33), India won handsomely.In both these games, Chandrashekhar’s googly had his number. Unlike in his prime when he batted as an opener, Simpson turned up in the middle-order for this series.The home side prevailed 3-2 but the series continues to be rated among the finest and closest that India was ever involved in. As Mihir Bose wrote in his book, ‘A History of Indian Cricket,’ “In a head-tohead confrontation with Packer’s circus, the traditional game proved that nothing could replace real Tests.”Praising Simpson, who also took four wickets in the series, TOI’s KN Prabhu wrote in a series analysis, “A man of his experience and character was needed to nurse the many fledglings in his charge to full stature – and how successful he was proved in his achievements.As a cricketer, Simpson always emphasised on fitness and was also regarded among the finest slip fielders of all time. He also epitomised grit.Writing for Sportsweek’s World of Cricket in 1978, renowned cricket writer Ray Robinson revealed that the Aussie captain’s century in the decisive fifth Test against India had come under exceptional circumstances. “Not till after the match did he (Simpson) reveal he batted with a broken little finger from a dropped catch in the fourth Test,” Robinson wrote.PollWhich aspect of Bobby Simpson's game do you admire the most?His batting skills.His leadership qualities.His fielding ability.In his 62 Test career, Simpson struck 10 centuries. Of them four came against India, the other two in the 1968 series against Pataudi’s men. His overall Test average was close to 47, but his average against India was a little above 53. Clearly, he relished batting against quality spinners often using the pad to great effect.But in the famous Bombay Test in 1964, Simpson was at the receiving end when India wrenched out a nail-biting victory by two wickets on Dussehra day. “It was the most exciting Test seen in India since the 1948 (India vs West Indies in Bombay) one, some said the most exciting ever,” wrote Bose.Incidentally, not many know that Simpson was among the first to moot the idea of a cricket World Cup to secure the sport’s future.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Jordan Cox creates history as The Oval Invincibles set highest-ever The Hundred total (Image via X/@Cricket_World) Jordan Cox produced one of the most explosive batting displays seen in The Hundred as Oval Invincibles stormed to a record total of 226/4 before crushing Welsh Fire by 83 runs at The Kia Oval. The right-hander blasted 86 not out from just 29 deliveries, including 10 sixes, which equaled the competition’s individual record set by Liam Livingstone. His most spectacular moment came in the 11th over against Ajeet Singh Dale, where he hit him for 26 runs.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Cox launched the first three balls for consecutive sixes, over long-on, deep mid-wicket, and again over mid-wicket respectively, before a wide and a dot briefly halted the charge. He finished the set in style, reversing his stance to scoop a full toss over short fine leg, a shot that had the crowd on its feet. Cox’s merciless attack, a rapid opening partnership of 76 between Tawanda Muyeye and Will Jacks, Sam Curran adding 34 in a 97-run partnership with the star of the night all meant that the Invincibles set multiple records in the process. In total, they cleared the ropes 17 times, the most ever in a Hundred innings. Remarkably, Cox had managed only eight runs from his first eight balls before starting to fire on all cylinders. Welsh Fire never recovered in the chase. Jason Behrendorff struck with his first delivery, and Cox added a highlight in the field by sprinting back from mid-on to dismiss Steve Smith. Some resistance came in the form of Jonny Bairstow, whose 50 off 28 balls helped, but Tom Curran’s 4/15 wrapped up the innings for 143 in 93 balls.PollWhat aspect of Jordan Cox's innings impressed you the most?The number of sixes he hitHis strike rate of 296.55The variety of shots played The margin of defeat was the third largest in the competition’s history.

(PTI Photo/Kunal Patil) Former India allrounder Irfan Pathan has launched a scathing attack on Pakistan, accusing them of acting like self-appointed guardians of Muslims worldwide. Speaking candidly, Pathan said it was a “misconception” that Pakistan carried the responsibility of all Muslims, urging them to focus on their own issues first — a sentiment he admitted feeling at a personal level."Ek toh Pakistaniyo ko na ye lagta hai ki saare jo musalman hai duniya ke unki jo zimmedaari hai unhone le rakhi hai (One thing about Pakistanis is that they feel as if they’ve taken responsibility for all the Muslims in the world)," Pathan told The Lallantop.EXCLUSIVE: India to boycott Pakistan in Asia Cup?

I have a different kind of fight with him [Afridi] because when I was new and young in the team, there was an interview of Afridi with Harsha Bhogle,” Pathan said. “Afridi had said, ‘I am the real Pathan, he is a fake Pathan’. Badtameez aadmi hai (He is an ill-mannered man). Mujhe laga ki aap sirf mere baare mein nahi bol rahe ho, mere waalid ke baare mein bhi baat kar rahe (I felt he wasn’t just talking about me but also about my father, which he shouldn’t have done).”Pathan admitted the comment fueled his determination whenever he bowled to Afridi. “Toh jab jab mere haath mein ball tha, mere jahan mein yeh tha ki isko toh main out kar dunga (So whenever I had the ball in my hand, my only thought was that I would dismiss him). Maine out karke usko gyara baar bata chuka hoon ki asli Pathan kaun hai (By dismissing him 11 times, I’ve shown him who the real Pathan is). Bade bade maukon mein out kiya hai — series decider mein, World Cup final mein (I got him out on big occasions — in a series decider, in a World Cup final),” he added.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) Former India seamer Irfan Pathan has weighed in on the workload management debate. Without directly taking Jasprit Bumrah's name, Pathan strongly criticised the idea."I believe that technology and recovery should go hand in hand," he told Lallantop.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!"You should also listen to your body. But once you step onto the field, workload shouldn't be a consideration anymore. Once you step in, you are wearing the Indian jersey."After that, don't look back. You can't say, 'I will just bowl four overs' or 'I will bowl three overs.' People don’t just say this, they actually do it. That's how it works these days."I am talking about everyone, not just one player. Siraj, on the last day of the last Test, was bowling at 145 kmph. He has a workload too, right? This applies to everyone. But once you step in, you give it your all."PollDo you agree with Irfan Pathan's view that workload shouldn't be a consideration once players are on the field?AgreeDisagreeBefore the Indian team left for England, chief selector Ajit Agarkar and head coach Gautam Gambhir had said Bumrah wouldn’t feature in more than three Tests on tour due to workload management, especially after he picked up a back injury in the Sydney Test against Australia in January this year.Bumrah featured in the first Test at Headingley, Leeds, followed by the third and fourth games at Lord’s and Old Trafford, Manchester, respectively. In those three matches, Bumrah picked up 14 wickets, including two five-wicket hauls, bowling 119.4 overs at an average of 26. He wasn’t included in the playing XI for the fifth Test at The Oval and was subsequently released from the squad ahead of day two’s play.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Pathan admitted that Afridi's words fueled his determination to dismiss him, which he achieved 11 times across formats, including key moments like the 2007 T20 World Cup final. Irfan Pathan and Shahid Afridi NEW DELHI: Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has opened up about his long-standing on-field rivalry with Pakistan’s Shahid Afridi, recalling both the personal barbs and the cricketing battles that defined their encounters.Pathan, who had immense success against Pakistan in his career — taking 67 wickets and scoring 807 runs, including a century — dismissed Afridi 11 times across formats, including a golden duck in the 2007 T20 World Cup final. Speaking on Lallantop, the former left-arm pacer revealed how the rivalry turned personal early on.IRFAN PATHAN FLYING FROM MUMBAI SPOTTED AT AIRPORTGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!“Dismissed him 11 times. I have a different kind of fight with him [Afridi] because when I was new and young in the team… there was an interview of Afridi with Harsha Bhogle,” Pathan said. “Afridi had said, ‘I am the real Pathan, he is a fake Pathan’. Badtameez aadmi hai. Mujhe laga ki aap sirf mere baare mein nahi bol rahe ho, mere waalid ke baare mein bhi baat kar rahe, jo aapko nahi karna chahiye tha.”PollWho do you think had the upper hand in the Pathan-Afridi rivalry?Irfan PathanShahid AfridiBoth were equally matchedPathan admitted the comment fueled his determination whenever he bowled to Afridi. “Toh jab jab mere haath mein ball tha, mere jahan mein yeh tha ki isko toh main out kar dunga. Maine out karke usko gyara baar bata chuka hoon ki asli Pathan kaun hai. Bade bade maukon mein out kiya hai — series decider mein, World Cup final mein,” he added.The rivalry also played out off the field. Pathan recalled a heated exchange during India’s 2006 tour of Pakistan when both teams were traveling by flight from Karachi to Lahore. “Afridi came and placed his hand on my head, messing up my hair. He asked me, ‘How are you kid?’ I said, ‘Since when have you become my father?’ The childish behaviour was actually his,” Pathan recounted.What followed was a verbal spat, with Pathan landing the sharper wordplay. “I said, ‘He (Afridi) has eaten dog meat, he has been barking for a long time.’ After that, Afridi couldn’t say anything. Whatever he might have said, I would have just said, ‘Look, he is barking again.’ From that moment, he understood he could not win against me verbally,” Pathan explained.For Pathan, Afridi’s remarks may have crossed a line, but the Indian all-rounder believes his performances on the field offered the most fitting reply. “I showed him who the real Pathan is — not once, but 11 times.”Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Glenn Maxwell (Pic credit: CA) Glenn Maxwell, 62 not out off 36 balls, once again showed why he remains Australia’s ultimate match-winner in white-ball cricket, powering his side to a nerve-wracking two-wicket victory over South Africa in Cairns on Saturday. With this win, Australia sealed the three-match T20I series 2-1 in front of a packed home crowd that witnessed a grandstand finish to the first-ever T20I at the venue.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Chasing 173 on a tricky surface, the game went down to the wire. With four runs needed off two balls, Maxwell produced a moment of magic. Facing a full toss, he unleashed a premeditated reverse scoop that sailed over the infield and trickled to the boundary. The crowd erupted, Maxwell roared in delight, and Adam Zampa sprinted across the field to embrace him in celebration. The dugout rose in unison, acknowledging a vintage display from one of the finest ball-strikers in the game.Inside The Oval: An Exclusive Tour of the Stadium Where India Played the Final TestThe "Big Show" had been written off too many times, but on this night, he silenced doubters with his trademark flair as he guided his team home in style.Scorecard: Australia vs South Africa, 3rd T20IEarlier, captain Mitchell Marsh and Travis Head steadied the chase with a 66-run stand in eight overs after a slow start. Marsh, who struck 54 off 37 balls with three fours and five sixes, targeted the deep square-leg boundary with telling effect. But South Africa clawed their way back into the contest, picking three wickets in the space of 13 balls around the halfway mark. Just when the visitors sensed an opening, Maxwell took charge to tilt the balance decisively.Speaking after receiving the Player of the Match award, Maxwell credited his calm approach. “Corbin bowled a brilliant over. Nice to get over the line. I just stayed calm, watched the ball, and understood where to find the boundaries. We’ve had a great run with this T20 group. It’s great for our confidence — we’re building something nice,” he said.Tim David, named Player of the Series, was quick to acknowledge Maxwell’s brilliance: “Without Maxi playing a blinder here, I wouldn’t have been standing here. I’m just enjoying going out there and competing. Keeping it simple, not trying too hard. Form comes and goes.”Australia’s recent form in T20Is now makes for imposing reading: series wins over Scotland, Pakistan, West Indies, and South Africa, alongside a drawn series in England. With Maxwell back in full flight, the Aussies look every bit the force heading into a packed white-ball calendar.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Serious Injury Replacement: BCCI introduces new rule after Pant's injury
The BCCI has introduced a "Serious Injury Replacement" rule for multi-day domestic cricket starting in the 2025-26 season, prompted by injuries in the recent India-England series. This allows teams to replace players injured by external blows, like fractures, with like-for-like substitutes approved by the match referee. While welcomed by some, like India's coach Gautam Gambhir, the rule has faced criticism.

This allows teams to replace players injured by external blows, like fractures, with like-for-like substitutes approved by the match referee. While welcomed by some, like India's coach Gautam Gambhir, the rule has faced criticism. Rishabh Pant (Getty Images) The BCCI has formally introduced a new clause in its playing conditions for the 2025–26 domestic season, allowing “Serious Injury Replacements” in multi-day cricket. The move, inspired by incidents in the recent Anderson–Tendulkar Trophy between India and England, is one of the most significant amendments to the game’s rules in years.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!The rule was sparked by the dramatic fourth and fifth Tests of the series, where Rishabh Pant fractured his foot and Chris Woakes dislocated his shoulder, leaving both teams effectively a player short. While concussion substitutes have been in place for several years, no provision existed for replacements due to other serious injuries.“If a player sustains a serious injury during the course of the relevant match, a Serious Injury Replacement may be permitted,” the BCCI’s updated Playing Conditions state. The injury must occur within the field of play and be the result of an external blow, such as a fracture, deep cut, or dislocation.The call for such a move had drawn mixed reactions. India head coach Gautam Gambhir, speaking after Pant’s injury in Manchester, welcomed the change: “Absolutely, I’m all for it. If umpires and referees see it’s a major injury, why should a team be punished? Imagine playing 10 vs 11 in a closely fought Test. There’s nothing wrong with allowing a visible, like-for-like replacement.”However, England captain Ben Stokes dismissed the concept outright: “It’s absolutely ridiculous that there’s even a conversation around injury replacements. Injuries are part of the game. I understand concussion replacements for player safety, but this will create loopholes. You pick your eleven; that’s it.”Despite Stokes’ stance, his own teammate Woakes’ dislocated shoulder in the very next Test added weight to the calls for reform.Serious Injury Replacement: The Rules in DetailReplacements must be like-for-like and drawn from the nominated substitutes named at the toss.The match referee, after consultation with doctors and on-field umpires, will decide on the legitimacy of the replacement.A replacement player inherits all warnings, penalty time, or suspensions of the injured player.Wicketkeeper replacements may be permitted from outside the nominated substitutes if no reserve keeper is available.Both the injured player and the replacement will be recorded as having played the match.The BCCI clarified that this rule will only apply to multi-day domestic tournaments, including the CK Nayudu Trophy (U19s), and will not extend to white-ball competitions like the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy or Vijay Hazare Trophy for now. The Indian Premier League (IPL) also remains outside its scope.The rule has already been explained to umpires at a seminar in Ahmedabad, with the BCCI stressing that the match referee’s decision is final and not open to appeal.TOI had reported on July 25 that the ICC is contemplating the introduction of injury replacements.Although the International Cricket Council (ICC) has yet to implement such a rule, India’s domestic experiment could pave the way for wider discussions on whether Test cricket should evolve to shield teams from the setback of untimely injuries.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Karun Nair NEW DELHI: For Karun Nair, the recently concluded Anderson–Tendulkar Trophy in England was a bittersweet experience. The India batter, who travelled with a mountain of domestic runs behind him, returned with 205 runs from eight innings at an average of 25.62. The top score of 57 at The Oval was his lone half-century, but what truly rankled were the missed chances: scores of 40, 31, 26 and 21 — good starts that fizzled out.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

But I was just not able to convert it, which was frustrating for me more than anyone else,” Nair admitted to PTI. “The one lesson I’ve reflected upon is making sure that I convert the start that I get. I’ve spoken to a lot of people about it, and I’m going to work on it very soon.”EXCLUSIVE | Harbhajan Singh on Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Shubman Gill, India vs Pakistan and moreYet, the 33-year-old takes pride in being part of a side that fought England to a 2–2 draw. “Not many teams have gone to England and levelled the series in five Tests. I’m really proud to be part of this amazing team,” he said.Nair credited skipper Shubman Gill and head coach Gautam Gambhir for fostering clarity and resilience. “The best part was that the messaging was clear. We showed that we never give up, and the attitude was to always keep fighting. You could see that on the field,” he noted.Back in India, Nair’s immediate focus will be Karnataka, where he returns after two seasons with Vidarbha. “It was a tough decision to leave, but due to personal reasons I had to. Now it’s about helping Karnataka and guiding the youngsters whenever needed,” he said.Currently leading Mysore Warriors in the KSCA Maharaja Trophy, Nair insists his eyes are set firmly on improvement. “For me, it’s about working on myself day by day and improving every single day on my skills and fitness,” he said.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Instead, Kaif backed Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma as his opening pair, with Tilak Varma slotted at No. 3. India’s T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav was Kaif’s choice to lead the side, with Axar Patel named as vice-captain — another unusual pick that sparked debate among fans.PollDo you agree with Mohammad Kaif's decision to leave Shubman Gill out of the playing XI for the Asia Cup?Yes, it was a good callNo, Gill should be in the XIKaif’s middle and lower order featured Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Washington Sundar, and Kuldeep Yadav, while the pace attack was led by Jasprit Bumrah, supported by Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Siraj. For the bench, Kaif listed Gill, Siraj, Jitesh Sharma, and Varun Chakaravarthy, meaning the Test captain, Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy’s star pacer, a wicketkeeper-batter, and a mystery spinner all missed out from his preferred XI.Kaif justified his bold selection by stressing the need for balance and versatility in the shortest format, highlighting Samson’s attacking ability at the top and Abhishek’s recent all-round performances. His choices, however, have already triggered strong reactions, particularly given Gill’s stature and recent form.As the Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee finalises its squad, all eyes will be on whether Gill not only makes the cut but also secures vice-captaincy in India’s squad for the Asia Cup.Kaif's India squad for Asia CupSanju Samson, Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma, Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Shubman Gill, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Varun Chakaravarthy, Jitesh Sharma and Mohammed Siraj.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Arjun Tendulkar’s fiancée Saaniya Chandhok with future sister-in-law Sara Tendulkar in an old video (Screengrab via Instagram/@saratendulkar) A resurfaced social media post has offered a glimpse into the long-standing friendship between Sara Tendulkar and Saaniya Chandok, who is now engaged to Sara’s brother, Arjun Tendulkar. The video, shared by Sara in October 2024, appears to be from a girls’ trip. Captioned “table for three”, it features Sara, Saaniya and a friend showing off their outfits and enjoying different locations. The clip, now in the spotlight after the news of Saaniya's engagement with Arjun Tendulkar, highlights how close Saaniya has been to the Tendulkar family long before her engagement. That bond has now taken on a new meaning, with Arjun Tendulkar and Saaniya Chandok formalising their relationship earlier this week. The 25-year-old cricketer, son of Sachin Tendulkar, got engaged to 26-year-old Saaniya on August 13 in a private ceremony attended by close friends and family. Saaniya, the granddaughter of businessman Ravi Ghai, comes from a family deeply connected to India’s food and hospitality industry. The Ghai family runs the Graviss Group, which manages Baskin Robbins’ India operations and owns The Brooklyn Creamery. Graviss Food Solutions Private Limited reported ₹624 crore in revenue for FY23-24. Fans have also been given a rare look at the Tendulkars’ personal celebrations through recent Instagram photos. The images show Sachin Tendulkar performing a pooja alongside his wife Anjali, daughter Sara, son Arjun and future daughter-in-law Saaniya. The intimate family gathering, has further showcased the growing bond between the two families. Sara recently launched a pilates academy in Andheri, Mumbai.  The age gap between Arjun and Saaniya, a little over a year, has already drawn attention online, drawing comparisons to Sachin Tendulkar’s own marriage. The cricket icon married Anjali in 1995 despite her being five years older.PollDo you believe age differences matter in relationships?Yes, they can be significantNo, it doesn't matterIt depends on the individuals For now, though, the focus remains on the Tendulkars’ newest chapter. From old trip videos to quiet family rituals, glimpses of Arjun and Saaniya’s journey together are steadily emerging, and cricket fans are taking note.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

(Image: Special Arrangement)12 New Delhi: Growing up in Mohali, in a 2BHK flat, Shubman Gill’s favourite pastime was copying his childhood hero -- Virat Kohli. He would try to imitate his walk, his cover drive, his celebration, and even played most of his early career with a red handkerchief tucked in his trousers.Around 8,782 kilometers from Mohali, in Pretoria, in the Brevis’ backyard, Dewald and his elder brother Reinardt, wearing Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers’ Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) jerseys, used to mimic both the legends with match simulations -- imagining themselves pulling off a heist for RCB.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Brevis has had a similar trajectory to Gill. Like Gill, he was portrayed as the next “prince.”Both of them hit a wall. Form deserted them, critics came out with swords, but their heroes stood like rocks and kept backing them. Back in 2019, when Gill first entered the Indian dressing room in New Zealand, Kohli famously said: “I saw him bat in the nets and I was like 'wow -- I was not even 10 percent of that when I was 19.'”Similarly, De Villiers also helped Brevis in his early days. “I have been his mentor for about two years now and helped him with his batting and his attitude towards cricket,” De Villiers had told Netwerk24 in 2022, when the youngster burst onto the scene in the U19 World Cup.In the last couple of months, Gill, the anointed prince, found his feet in Test cricket, smashing 754 runs in his first Test series as captain. It was Kohli again who wrote a special message for his successor at No. 4: “Well played star boy. Rewriting history. Onwards and upwards from here. You deserve all this,” Kohli wrote after Gill scored a sublime 269 and 161 at Edgbaston.Likewise, earlier this week, when Brevis smoked a 41-ball hundred against Australia, De Villiers went gung-ho over his countryman’s knock and took a shot at the IPL teams, saying: “The boy can play.”What changed for Gill and Brevis?Before Shubman Gill was appointed Team India’s Test captain, he wanted to prove himself in England. He practiced with the red Dukes, worked on his trigger movement, and sought help from his cricket-tragic father Lakhwinder Singh Gill.Gill Sr. reminded the youngster why he was such a prolific run-scorer at the age-group level and in the Ranji Trophy, and asked him to “go back to the basics.” A confident Shubman even predicted that he wanted to be the best batter in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, and boy, did he walk the talk.Dewald Brevis with his childhood coach Deon Botes. (Special Arrangement)For Dewald Brevis, it was his childhood coach Deon Botes -- who has played a massive role in the development of several South African cricketers, including AB de Villiers and Faf du Plessis.Botes, an Economics professor and former Director of Sport at Afrikaans Hoër Seunskool, more popularly known as Affies, shared how the child prodigy battled his dark phase and turned it around.“He went back to his basics. So, I think with the T20 game, he might have gone a bit loose technically,” Botes told TimesofIndia.com.PollWho do you think has a brighter future in cricket, Shubman Gill or Dewald Brevis?Shubman GillDewald BrevisBoth have equal potentialNeither will make a significant impact“In T20 cricket, obviously power hitting plays a big role. And I think he got a bit stuck with that. Playing a bit more red-ball cricket in the domestic league, I think, helped him just to fine-tune his technique a bit. So, it just looks like the old Dewald Brevis that we knew. I think he’s basically gone back to what he knows works, and it’s been successful for him.”Brevis’ redemptionLast year, after Christmas, Brevis called Botes asking for help.“So, last year, on the 28th of December, he came back to me and we worked for three days on his game again. Just going back to the basics, to what he was used to,” shared Botes.“He just wanted to get back to basics, which we did. And we basically gave him a clearer mind of what he wanted to do. A lot of people talk to you and there’s a lot of noise about you, and at times, you kind of lose track of what you actually want to do and what works for you.Dewald Brevis with coach Deon Botes at the Afrikaans Hoër Seunskool. (Special Arrangement)“So, he came back to me at the end of last year to just get back to his roots, back to the basics, and to find the right way for him to score. It was tough, but we had lots of conversations and lots of sessions to work through it.”When asked whether playing too much T20 cricket had corrupted Brevis’ technique, Botes said: “He really wanted to play cricket at the highest level and to show his skills and abilities. So, I think it was never about that for him.“He just wanted to play and score runs and be good. That’s basically all. Somewhere in this process, he might have got a bit confused about what he wanted to do. Like I said, there’s a lot of noise around playing like that, with people talking to him as a youngster. It’s probably difficult for him to work out who to listen to and who not. But he can’t listen to everybody. So when he came back to me, it was just about having one voice and going back to what works for him.”Dewald Brevis of South Africa bats during the T20 international cricket match between Australia and South Africa in Darwin, Australia, Tuesday, Aug. 12, 2025. (Jono Searle/AAPImage via AP)Botes feels his ward is ready to take all three formats by storm.“I think he can definitely play in all three formats for South Africa. He’s already played in two of them. So it’s just the 50-over game he hasn’t debuted in yet, but I think that will come now.“Yes, I think he’ll be successful in all three. I think Dewald would actually appreciate the long format, red-ball cricket. And I think he’s good enough to make it in all three formats,” he said.Make way for the Next GenEvery cricket lover has lived that moment, standing before a mirror, trying to mimic a hero’s batting stance or a bowler’s graceful run-up and release. Most imitations end in awkward copies, but a rare few manage to carry those borrowed styles all the way to the international stage. It’s the perfect embodiment of the saying: fake it till you make it.CAIRNS, AUSTRALIA - AUGUST 16:  Dewald Brevis of South Africa bats during game three of the Men's T20 International series between Australia and South Africa at Cazaly's Stadium on August 16, 2025 in Cairns, Australia. (Photo by Emily Barker/Getty Images)Experts often insist that a player’s trademark shot or bowling action is inimitable, something born of instinct and impossible to reproduce. Yet, some youngsters tune that noise out and keep practicing what inspires them.Take Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers, for instance. They have long been the blueprint for aspiring cricketers. And Shubman Gill and Dewald Brevis, their biggest admirers, seem to have unlocked that template. From cover drives to the lap shot, from the scoop to the front-foot punch, to the reverse sweep -- Gill and Brevis mirror the range of their idols with astonishing ease.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Wicketkeepers use various methods, from banter to quirky routines, to impact the game beyond their primary role. Phil Tufnell and Jack Russell of England (Images via Getty Images) Former England cricketer Phil Tufnell has revealed a rather unusual tactic once used by his wicketkeeper Jack Russell to unsettle opposition batters. In a light-hearted discussion, Tufnell said Russell would deliberately avoid brushing his teeth for a couple of days before a match. “My wicketkeeper, Jack Russell, didn’t use to brush his teeth for a couple of days. He said he wanted to put the batters off when he was standing up to the crease. Lots of little shenanigans go on there,” Tufnell revealed on BBC, leaving listeners amused at the extent wicketkeepers sometimes go to in order to gain an edge.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! The role of a wicketkeeper has often extended beyond just their skills with the gloves. They play a crucial part in controlling the energy on the field, especially through their chatter behind the stumps. Some use humour, some rely on constant encouragement, and others employ more unusual methods like sledging and as in this case - Russell’s tactic.29 Aug 1989:  Jack Russell of England waits behind the wicket during the Sixth Ashes Test match against Australia at the Kennington Oval in London. The match ended in a draw. (Credit: Adrian  Murrell/Allsport) West Indies all-rounder Carlos Brathwaite, also part of the discussion, underlined how wicketkeepers can influence the flow of a game. “Yeah, there are some that, when you’re batting, it’s just like, shut up. But as a bowler, you just love it. It brings a different energy. When you have a quiet keeper, it feels like the game takes so long,” Brathwaite said, pointing to how a vocal presence can lift a bowling side’s intensity.PollHow important is a wicketkeeper's chatter behind the stumps?Essential for team moraleHelpful but not crucialNot important at all From playful banter to strange personal routines, wicketkeepers often find their own ways to get under a batter’s skin and keep their teammates engaged. Whether it is through non-stop chatter, sharp instructions, or quirky antics, their influence goes far beyond the scorecard.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

The two Test victories India achieved did not feature Virat (Kohli), (Cheteshwar) Pujara, Rohit (Sharma), (Mohammed) Shami or Bumrah!"It reminded us of the eternal truth of sport and life — no one, however great, is indispensable. And this is how India must handle Bumrah,” he added.Manjrekar also maintained that Indian cricket should not adjust for Bumrah.PollDo you agree with Sanjay Manjrekar's criticism of Jasprit Bumrah's participation in the Tests?Yes, he should have played betterNo, he is a key playerPartially, he needs to improveI don't have an opinion“As for Bumrah, of whom I am a fan, if he really wants to serve Indian Test cricket, longevity and durability are imperative for him. After all, the true test of a great athlete is to still turn up when not 100% fit and deliver,” said Manjrekar.“Indian cricket must not adjust for Bumrah — Bumrah must.

Obituary | Even when past his prime, Bobby Simpson always got the better of India
Bobby Simpson, who passed away at 89, made a remarkable comeback at 41 to captain Australia against India in 1977 after a nine-year retirement. Tasked with leading a team of newcomers due to Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket, Simpson not only captained with tactical brilliance but also topped the run charts, playing a crucial role in Australia's 3-2 series victory.

Tasked with leading a team of newcomers due to Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket, Simpson not only captained with tactical brilliance but also topped the run charts, playing a crucial role in Australia's 3-2 series victory. Legendary cricketer and World Cup-winning coach Bob Simpson dies at 89 Cricket was in chaos in 1977. Billionaire TV mogul Kerry Packer had lured Australia’s best, barring speed demon Jeff Thomson, for a never-before seen pro league cobbled from cricket’s reigning stars. The Australian board was forced to pull out a mothballed Bobby Simpson, then 41, to skipper the side against Bishan Singh Bedi’s touring India.The desperate decision turned out to be a masterstroke. Simpson, who passed away on Saturday at 89, not only skippered the squad filled with newbies with tactical acumen but also became the team’s leading run-scorer (539). Interestingly, he had played his last Test against MAK Pataudi’s India in 1968 and was making a comeback from retirement after nine long years.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!In the three Tests that Australia won of the five-match series, Simpson’s resolute batting was vital, indeed the difference between the two sides: 7 and 89 in Brisbane, 176 and 39 in Perth and 100 and 51 in Adelaide. In the two Tests he failed, Melbourne (2 and 4) and Sydney (38 and 33), India won handsomely.In both these games, Chandrashekhar’s googly had his number. Unlike in his prime when he batted as an opener, Simpson turned up in the middle-order for this series.The home side prevailed 3-2 but the series continues to be rated among the finest and closest that India was ever involved in. As Mihir Bose wrote in his book, ‘A History of Indian Cricket,’ “In a head-tohead confrontation with Packer’s circus, the traditional game proved that nothing could replace real Tests.”Praising Simpson, who also took four wickets in the series, TOI’s KN Prabhu wrote in a series analysis, “A man of his experience and character was needed to nurse the many fledglings in his charge to full stature – and how successful he was proved in his achievements.As a cricketer, Simpson always emphasised on fitness and was also regarded among the finest slip fielders of all time. He also epitomised grit.Writing for Sportsweek’s World of Cricket in 1978, renowned cricket writer Ray Robinson revealed that the Aussie captain’s century in the decisive fifth Test against India had come under exceptional circumstances. “Not till after the match did he (Simpson) reveal he batted with a broken little finger from a dropped catch in the fourth Test,” Robinson wrote.PollWhich aspect of Bobby Simpson's game do you admire the most?His batting skills.His leadership qualities.His fielding ability.In his 62 Test career, Simpson struck 10 centuries. Of them four came against India, the other two in the 1968 series against Pataudi’s men. His overall Test average was close to 47, but his average against India was a little above 53. Clearly, he relished batting against quality spinners often using the pad to great effect.But in the famous Bombay Test in 1964, Simpson was at the receiving end when India wrenched out a nail-biting victory by two wickets on Dussehra day. “It was the most exciting Test seen in India since the 1948 (India vs West Indies in Bombay) one, some said the most exciting ever,” wrote Bose.Incidentally, not many know that Simpson was among the first to moot the idea of a cricket World Cup to secure the sport’s future.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Thieves broke into her ancestral home in Hooghly and stole over 150 medals and mementos. The stolen items included her Padma Shri brooch and SAF Games gold medals. Household fittings were also taken. The theft was discovered by her brother. Police are investigating the incident and have questioned suspects. TOI reported that over 150 medals were stolen from Bula Choudhury's house in Hindmotor (Images via IANS & CCI) Bula Choudhury, one of India’s celebrated swimmers and a Padma Shri recipient, has been left devastated after thieves looted her ancestral home in Hindmotor, Hooghly district. The 54-year-old, popularly known as the “Queen of Seas,” is a former SAF Games champion who also famously crossed the English Channel twice, in 1989 and 1999. She now resides in Kolkata’s Kasba area. Choudhury’s career was decorated with remarkable achievements. Born in 1970, she first made her mark as a nine-year-old at the 1979 national swimming competition, dominating her age group.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!She went on to win multiple gold medals at the South Asian Federation (SAF) Games, with four in Kathmandu in 1984 and six in Colombo in 1991. In recognition of her achievements, she was honoured with the Arjuna Award in 1990 and the Padma Shri in 2009. The glory of her long career now feels diminished after a break-in at her Hindmotor residence. Thieves stole more than 150 medals and mementos, including her Padma Shri brooch and 10 SAF Games gold medals, along with household fittings such as taps and washbasins. “They took away things that are of no value to them but invaluable to me. From 1979, when I started competing as a nine-year-old, till I retired in 1995, all that I earned were medals. They are all gone,” Choudhury told TOI. The theft came to light on Independence Day when her brother Dolan arrived to clean the property and found the back gate broken, the lock pried open, and the rooms ransacked. “All the medals from the drawing room glass cabinet are missing. The basins in the bathrooms had been smashed and the taps removed. Even the stop cocks in the cisterns are missing,” he told TOI.PollDo you believe that more security measures should be implemented for the homes of celebrated athletes?Yes, definitelyNo, it is the athlete's responsibility Police said this was the third such incident at the house, which remains unoccupied most of the time. Similar thefts in 2014 saw jewellery, mementos and electronics stolen. TOI earlier reported that Chandernagore deputy commissioner of police Arnab Biswas confirmed that five suspects have been picked up for questioning, while forensic teams are examining the site.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

The right-hander blasted 86 not out from just 29 deliveries, including 10 sixes, which equaled the competition’s individual record set by Liam Livingstone. His most spectacular moment came in the 11th over against Ajeet Singh Dale, where he hit him for 26 runs.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Cox launched the first three balls for consecutive sixes, over long-on, deep mid-wicket, and again over mid-wicket respectively, before a wide and a dot briefly halted the charge. He finished the set in style, reversing his stance to scoop a full toss over short fine leg, a shot that had the crowd on its feet. Cox’s merciless attack, a rapid opening partnership of 76 between Tawanda Muyeye and Will Jacks, Sam Curran adding 34 in a 97-run partnership with the star of the night all meant that the Invincibles set multiple records in the process. In total, they cleared the ropes 17 times, the most ever in a Hundred innings. Remarkably, Cox had managed only eight runs from his first eight balls before starting to fire on all cylinders. Welsh Fire never recovered in the chase. Jason Behrendorff struck with his first delivery, and Cox added a highlight in the field by sprinting back from mid-on to dismiss Steve Smith. Some resistance came in the form of Jonny Bairstow, whose 50 off 28 balls helped, but Tom Curran’s 4/15 wrapped up the innings for 143 in 93 balls.PollWhat aspect of Jordan Cox's innings impressed you the most?The number of sixes he hitHis strike rate of 296.55The variety of shots played The margin of defeat was the third largest in the competition’s history.

Coach Javier Mascherano admitted the staff would monitor Messi’s recovery closely after he appeared to stretch his leg at times. “The important thing is that he finished (the match),” Mascherano said as quoted by AP.

Gautam Gambhir, fresh off a drawn Test series in England, is set to reshape India's T20I team.

With senior players retired, Gambhir is implementing his philosophy, prioritizing IPL talent and specialist players. He emphasizes impactful plays on every ball and values all-rounders for increased flexibility. LONDON, ENGLAND - JULY 30: India coach Gautam Gambhir speaks with captain Shubman Gill during a net session at The Kia Oval on July 30, 2025 in London, England. (Photo by Gareth Copley/Getty Images) New Delhi: Moments after India pulled off a miraculous draw in the fourth Test in Manchester last month, head coach Gautam Gambhir turned up at the press conference in his usual feisty avatar. It was the only Test during the two-month long tour in which India had been trailing England for almost four days. Gambhir wasn’t merely there to express his glee or relief. He was there to reiterate that those who doubted his strategies weren’t clued in. The coach feeds off the challenges thrown at him. In coming back from England with a 2-2 scoreline, he has been vindicated for some of the tough calls he took.The next six months, starting with the Asia Cup in UAE next month, will be the first time Gambhir will truly get to work on the T20I team for a period of time. Yet, the current T20I side is more his baby. His stint as India’s head coach started with Suryakumar Yadav being propelled to T20I captaincy ahead of Hardik Pandya. With Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli already retired from the format at the start of his stint, he could seamlessly drive home his philosophy in the dressing room. It didn’t matter if India were the new T20I world champions.Explained: Why The India-Pakistan Asia Cup Clash Cannot Be Cancelled Despite BacklashGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!“T20 World Cup, T20 side for India should be selected from IPL,” Gambhir said on former India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin’s YouTube channel just before assuming the role with the Indian team. Gambhir isn’t looking to rock the boat. But by now, it has been well established that he doesn’t mind dragging established names out of their comfort zones. He is rarely inhibited while giving more responsibility to unheralded cricketers — be it Suryakumar Yadav and Manish Pandey at KKR in 2014 or backing Ayush Badoni at Lucknow Super Giants.Much of Washington Sundar’s evolution as a Test allrounder is down to Gambhir’s unwavering backing. Gambhir swears by continuity. Despite all the talk of flexibility, he seeks stability at the top. The chatter in Indian cricket is that he would prefer an all format captain soon to build a common culture. Gambhir has been very clear with his vision. He walked in with an idea to rebrand the T20 team. India have often been accused of not being able to move with the times in the shortest format. Gambhir has decided to address it with players who can be branded as T20 specialists. He doesn’t mind if the pool swelled. That’s why Ramandeep Singh and Mayank Yadav were given their opportunities last year. India’s attacking brand of T20 cricket over the last 12 months is proof enough of how the Delhi man wants to go about his job.PollDo you believe Gautam Gambhir's strategies will lead India to success in T20 cricket?Yes, absolutelyNo, I have doubtsMaybe, it depends on executionI need more time to decideThis is the format that brought him recognition as a tactician. He won two IPL titles with KKR as a captain more than a decade ago before returning as a mentor in 2024 and delivering their third. He also stands out, being quite bullish about ‘results’ rather than process. Those who share the dressing room with Gambhir say that the coach loves breaking the game up into 120 balls rather than looking at it as a 20-over entity. ‘Every ball has to have an impact’ is his go-to phrase.There’s no room for getting comfortable. Roles are assigned as per skills, not batting numbers. He is comfortable with this facet of a modern-day T20 cricketer. Shivam Dube, for one, will always get preference since he can go up the order and blast the bowling if the openers get off to great starts. There are no designated finishers.Gambhir’s inclination towards having allrounders stems from the need to have more options. The Asia Cup may give us a glimpse of how he wants to go about his business in the next few months, but nothing is cast in stone yet. With the success in Champions Trophy and England, things have started to fall in place for Gambhir. Till the transition button is pressed in ODIs, it won’t be surprising to see a few unexpected moves in T20 cricket.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

(PTI Photo/Kunal Patil) Former India allrounder Irfan Pathan has launched a scathing attack on Pakistan, accusing them of acting like self-appointed guardians of Muslims worldwide. Speaking candidly, Pathan said it was a “misconception” that Pakistan carried the responsibility of all Muslims, urging them to focus on their own issues first — a sentiment he admitted feeling at a personal level."Ek toh Pakistaniyo ko na ye lagta hai ki saare jo musalman hai duniya ke unki jo zimmedaari hai unhone le rakhi hai (One thing about Pakistanis is that they feel as if they’ve taken responsibility for all the Muslims in the world)," Pathan told The Lallantop.EXCLUSIVE: India to boycott Pakistan in Asia Cup?

Jo mujhe lagta hai yaar thoda thehro, apne aap pe thoda phle dhyan do (What I feel is — hold on a bit, first focus on yourselves).""I’ve felt this at a personal level."Pathan also opened up about his long-standing on-field rivalry with Pakistan’s Shahid Afridi, recalling both the personal barbs and the cricketing battles that defined their encounters.The former India allrounder, who enjoyed immense success against Pakistan in his career — taking 67 wickets and scoring 807 runs, including a century — dismissed Afridi 11 times across formats, including for a golden duck in the 2007 T20 World Cup final.“Dismissed him 11 times. I have a different kind of fight with him [Afridi] because when I was new and young in the team, there was an interview of Afridi with Harsha Bhogle,” Pathan said. “Afridi had said, ‘I am the real Pathan, he is a fake Pathan’. Badtameez aadmi hai (He is an ill-mannered man). Mujhe laga ki aap sirf mere baare mein nahi bol rahe ho, mere waalid ke baare mein bhi baat kar rahe (I felt he wasn’t just talking about me but also about my father, which he shouldn’t have done).”Pathan admitted the comment fueled his determination whenever he bowled to Afridi. “Toh jab jab mere haath mein ball tha, mere jahan mein yeh tha ki isko toh main out kar dunga (So whenever I had the ball in my hand, my only thought was that I would dismiss him). Maine out karke usko gyara baar bata chuka hoon ki asli Pathan kaun hai (By dismissing him 11 times, I’ve shown him who the real Pathan is). Bade bade maukon mein out kiya hai — series decider mein, World Cup final mein (I got him out on big occasions — in a series decider, in a World Cup final),” he added.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

SUBSCRIBE NOW!However, her businessman father Sanjay Batra provided unwavering support, ensuring that societal pressure did not impede her ambitions to represent the country and win medals. On Tuesday earlier this week, the 24year-old became the first Indian ever to win a World Games medal in wushu, finishing runner-up in the women’s sanda 52kg event in Chengdu, China.India have won a total of seven medals in different editions of the World Games – one gold, two silver and four bronze – but Namrata’s wushu medal was a first in the quadrennial multisport event’s 44-year-long history.Today, Namrata’s grandparents feel immensely proud as they see her medal winning photos in the country’s newspapers and websites.PollWhat do you think has the biggest impact on an athlete's success?Support from familyPersonal determinationAccess to training facilitiesSocietal acceptance “I come from a big joint family. My grandparents earlier didn’t like theh fact that I had to wear shorts and t-shirts to pursue myu dreams. They initially put a lot of restrictions and didn’t even allow me to venture out alone for training and competition purposes. They were like what would the society say. For them, it was all about studying, getting good grades and looking for a settled job. But my father was always supportive of my career choices. He stood by me like a rock and backed my decision to become a martial arts player. Today, my grandparents and the same set of people who discouraged me, feel proud about my achievements. They fully support my journey,” Namrata told TOI after returning from Chengdu.Namrata boasts of an impressive CV. She is one of the country’s leading female wushu (sanda) athletes with several domestic and international medals to her name. Wushu, a Chinese martial art, is categorised into two disciplines: Taolu (forms) and Sanda (sparring). Taolu involves choreographed routines with empty hands or weapons, while Sanda is a full-contact combat sport.Apart from the historic silver at the World Games, she finished second at the Asian championships last year, won bronze at the Asia Cup earlier this year, a gold medal at the Moscow Wushu Star championships and had podium finishes at the Uttarakhand and Gujarat editions of the National Games. She was the junior national champion from 2015 to 2018 and continued her success as a senior, winning gold medals from 2018 to 2021 in the 48kg division before moving to the 52kg category in 2022.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

(Jono Searle/AAPImage via AP) R Ashwin has issued a clarification after his comments on Chennai Super Kings’ (CSK) acquisition of South Africa's Dewald Brevis sparked a huge controversy on social media.CSK had to put out a statement after Ashwin claimed that the franchise paid an “extra" amount to Dewald Brevis, who had a base price of Rs 75 lakh in the mega auction and went unsold. The South African was later roped in by CSK as an injury replacement for Gurjapneet Singh.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!“I just want to say this. I focus more on cricket rather than the chatter on social media," Ashwin said on his Hindi YouTube channel Ash Ki Baat."We make videos on YouTube to give our opinions. People who watch our videos don’t do any wrongdoing. However, those who don’t watch can twist the statements according to their whims and fancies.

The decision to bring him on board is very good."The franchise has struck gold during the purple patch of Dewald Brevis. He has been batting really well; he hits big sixes. Power-striker, monstrous hitter against spin,” he added.South African batting sensation Dewald Brevis scored the fastest T20I fifty for his country against Australia, reaching the milestone in just 22 balls during the series-deciding third T20I at Cazaly's Stadium in Cairns on Saturday. His explosive innings of 53 runs from 26 balls included multiple boundaries and consecutive sixes.Brevis surpassed his own record of 25 balls set earlier in the week during the second T20I in Darwin. The previous record was held by JP Duminy, who scored a 31-ball fifty in Melbourne in 2009.The 22-year-old also broke the record for the quickest fifty against Australia on their home soil, beating Ravi Bopara's 23-ball effort in Hobart in 2014.Prior to this match, Brevis had demonstrated his batting prowess in the second T20I with an unbeaten 125 off 56 balls. This innings included the second-fastest century for South Africa in T20Is, achieved in 41 balls, second only to David Miller's 35-ball century against Bangladesh in 2017.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) Former India seamer Irfan Pathan has weighed in on the workload management debate.

SUBSCRIBE NOW!"You should also listen to your body. But once you step onto the field, workload shouldn't be a consideration anymore. Once you step in, you are wearing the Indian jersey."After that, don't look back. You can't say, 'I will just bowl four overs' or 'I will bowl three overs.' People don’t just say this, they actually do it. That's how it works these days."I am talking about everyone, not just one player. Siraj, on the last day of the last Test, was bowling at 145 kmph. He has a workload too, right? This applies to everyone. But once you step in, you give it your all."PollDo you agree with Irfan Pathan's view that workload shouldn't be a consideration once players are on the field?AgreeDisagreeBefore the Indian team left for England, chief selector Ajit Agarkar and head coach Gautam Gambhir had said Bumrah wouldn’t feature in more than three Tests on tour due to workload management, especially after he picked up a back injury in the Sydney Test against Australia in January this year.Bumrah featured in the first Test at Headingley, Leeds, followed by the third and fourth games at Lord’s and Old Trafford, Manchester, respectively. In those three matches, Bumrah picked up 14 wickets, including two five-wicket hauls, bowling 119.4 overs at an average of 26. He wasn’t included in the playing XI for the fifth Test at The Oval and was subsequently released from the squad ahead of day two’s play.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

The foul on Joan Garcia (Image via X/@BarcaUniversal) Barcelona’s 3-0 win over Mallorca in La Liga on Saturday was overshadowed by a shocking incident involving debutant goalkeeper Joan García, who was on the receiving end of a brutal challenge. The 24-year-old, playing his first league game for the Catalan side, was struck in the face by Mallorca striker Vedat Muriqi in the 36th minute at Son Moix. Muriqi, stretching to reach a loose ball, raised his boot dangerously high and caught García full on the face. The impact stunned players and fans alike, with silence briefly falling over the stadium.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Initially, play continued, but referee intervention followed after a VAR review. The footage confirmed the severity of the foul, and Muriqi was shown a straight red card. The expulsion left Mallorca further crippled, having already lost Manu Morlanes to a red card just three minutes earlier. Reduced to nine men before halftime, the home side’s chances of getting a result plummeted. The challenge quickly became one of the talking points of the match. Clips of the incident became viral immediately, with many labeling it among the most reckless fouls seen in La Liga in recent times.  For García, it was a debut that will be remembered less for his contributions in goal and more for the violent moment that marked it. Despite the scare, he remained solid, maintained a clean sheet and was called on to make just one save.PollShould Vedat Muriqi face further disciplinary action after the incident?Yes, he shouldNo, a red card is enoughAs for the match itself, Raphinha opened the scoring for the visitors, Ferran Torres doubled the lead, and teenage star Lamine Yamal sealed the result late with a spectacular strike. The win added three points to Barcelona’s tally, but the evening will be recalled above all for the shocking blow García suffered in his first La Liga appearance.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Erling Haaland and Richarlison (Images via Getty Images) Manchester City began their Premier League campaign in emphatic fashion, crushing Wolves 4-0 at Molineux on Saturday, as newcomers Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki made instant impacts. Reijnders, a summer signing from AC Milan, was involved in three of the goals, showcasing the creativity Pep Guardiola wanted in order to replace Kevin De Bruyne. The Dutch midfielder assisted Erling Haaland’s opener with a cheeky flick in the 34th minute, before scoring himself three minutes later with an accurate strike into the bottom corner.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! He continued to control the game, combining with Oscar Bobb to set up Haaland’s second just past the hour. France international Cherki added the finishing touch, curling home from distance soon after coming on as a substitute. Tottenham also impressed, easing past Burnley 3-0 at home. Richarlison struck twice, both set up by Mohammed Kudus from the right flank, including a spectacular scissor kick for his second. Brennan Johnson added a third from Pape Sarr’s through ball to secure a comfortable win for last season’s Europa League champions. At Villa Park, Newcastle failed to take advantage of their dominance in a goalless draw against Aston Villa. Without striker Alexander Isak, who continues to push for a move away, the visitors lacked a cutting edge. New signing Anthony Elanga looked lively, but Villa held firm despite being reduced to 10 men when Ezri Konsa was dismissed for denying a goalscoring chance. Promoted Sunderland stunned West Ham with a 3-0 victory at home. Eliezer Mayenda and Dan Ballard both scored headers in the second half before Wilson Isidor sealed the result in stoppage time. Brighton looked set for three points when Matt O’Riley converted a penalty in the 55th minute after Sander Berge fouled Georginio Rutter. But deep into added time, Fulham snatched a draw as Rodrigo Muniz pounced on a corner to equalize in the 96th minute. Earlier in the day, the Premier League held moments of silence and applause across grounds in memory of Diogo Jota, the former Liverpool and Wolves forward who recently died in a car crash alongside his brother. Wolves fans displayed a large tifo and chanted his name in the 18th minute, honoring the number he wore for the club.PollWhich player had the biggest impact in Manchester City's victory over Wolves?Tijjani ReijndersErling HaalandRayan CherkiSomeone else The tributes followed Friday’s emotional scenes at Anfield, where Liverpool supporters remembered Jota in the club's 4-2 win over Bournemouth.

Orbiting 460 miles above Earth, it will capture high-resolution radar images, penetrating clouds and darkness. This breakthrough will provide critical data on climate change, natural hazards, and agricultural trends, offering global benefits through open data access.  In a landmark achievement for global space cooperation, NASA and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) have successfully deployed the world’s largest radar antenna in orbit. The 33-foot antenna, part of the joint NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission, is designed to capture Earth’s surface in unprecedented detail. Orbiting about 460 miles above the planet, the mission will provide high-resolution radar images that can penetrate clouds and operate both day and night. This breakthrough will empower scientists, policymakers, and disaster-response teams worldwide by offering critical data on climate change, natural hazards, and agricultural trends. The milestone marks a new era in Earth observation, combining advanced engineering with international collaboration.NASA, ISRO, and NISAR: Redefining Earth observationThe NISAR satellite, jointly managed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and ISRO, is equipped with dual-frequency L- and S-band synthetic aperture radar. This system allows it to track Earth’s surface changes with remarkable precision. Unlike optical satellites limited by weather or lighting conditions, NISAR provides continuous, reliable data, making it a game-changer for monitoring glaciers, forests, seismic activity, and farmlands. NASA emphasizes that this technology will revolutionize how nations prepare for disasters and manage resources.The 33-foot antenna, the largest ever used in a NASA Earth science mission, was built by Astro Aerospace, a Northrop Grumman company. Compact at launch, it expanded in orbit into its full umbrella-like shape. Engineers designed it to survive the extreme pressures of launch, the vacuum of space, and constant rotation at 4.5 revolutions per minute. This massive aperture is crucial for generating sharp radar images that will enable groundbreaking scientific studies.Synthetic aperture radar: Seeing the unseenSynthetic aperture radar (SAR) works like a powerful camera lens, simulating a larger antenna to produce high-resolution images. Using interferometric techniques, NISAR can compare radar images over time, creating 3D models of surface changes. These models can reveal subtle shifts such as slow land subsidence, early signs of landslides, or glacier retreat that would otherwise remain invisible.

This Oligocene-era predator, unlike modern baleen whales, possessed sharp teeth and large eyes, indicating an active hunting lifestyle. The remarkably preserved fossil offers crucial insights into whale evolution, particularly the transition from toothed predators to filter feeders.  In a groundbreaking discovery, scientists from Monash University and Museums Victoria have unearthed a 26-million-year-old whale skull at Jan Juc Beach in Victoria, Australia. The fossil belongs to a newly identified species, Janjucetus dullardi, a small but fierce predator from the Oligocene epoch. According to the research published on Tuesday, August 12, 2025 in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, the whale specimen (Janjucetus dullardi) represents a juvenile or subadult individual, estimated to be about 7 feet (2.1 meters) in length. Unlike modern baleen whales that filter-feed, Janjucetus had sharp teeth and large eyes, indicating it actively hunted prey like fish and squid.The fossil is exceptionally well-preserved, including the skull, ear bones, and teeth, rare features that offer vital insights into whale evolution. This species represents a key stage between land-dwelling ancestors and fully aquatic whales, helping scientists understand how early whales adapted to life in the ocean. The discovery not only sheds light on the evolutionary shift from toothed predators to filter feeders, but also provides a rare glimpse into ancient marine ecosystems. It highlights southern Australia’s importance in understanding the rich history of life in prehistoric oceans.How the whale skull fossil was discoveredScientists have revealed a 26-million-year-old whale skull fossil found in 2019 by fossil enthusiast Ross Dullard at Jan Juc Beach, Victoria, Australia. The fossil, embedded in ancient marine sediments, belongs to a newly identified species named Janjucetus dullardi, a small but fierce predator from the Oligocene epoch. Unlike modern baleen whales that filter-feed, Janjucetus had sharp teeth and large eyes, indicating it actively hunted prey such as fish and squid. Measuring just 2–3 meters in length, it was much smaller than today’s whales but well-adapted for predation in the warm, subtropical seas of its time.The fossil’s exceptional preservation, including parts of the skull, teeth, and ear bones, offers paleontologists an unprecedented look into early whale anatomy. Detailed examination of its jaw structure, sensory organs, and hearing system provides valuable insight into the evolutionary transition from land-dwelling mammals to fully aquatic whales. This discovery significantly advances our understanding of whale evolution and ancient marine ecosystems.What the whale skull fossil reveals about anatomyIn a groundbreaking discovery, scientists have unveiled a 26-million-year-old whale skull fossil, found in 2019 by fossil enthusiast Ross Dullard at Jan Juc Beach in Victoria, Australia. The fossil belongs to a newly identified species, Janjucetus dullardi, a small but powerful predator from the Oligocene epoch. Unlike modern baleen whales, Janjucetus had large forward-facing eyes, indicating sharp vision for hunting, and a jaw lined with sharp teeth suited for catching fish and other marine animals. Measuring 2–3 meters in length, it was much smaller than today’s whales but well-adapted for life as an agile marine hunter. Exceptionally preserved, the fossil includes parts of the skull, teeth, and ear bones. These features reveal early hearing adaptations, helping researchers understand how ancient whales detected prey underwater. By studying this skull, scientists gain rare insight into the evolutionary shift from active predation to filter feeding, and into the behavior, anatomy, and ecology of early whales in prehistoric oceans.Why this whale skull fossil matters for evolutionThe whale skull fossil of Janjucetus dullardi is key to understanding early whale evolution. As part of the mammalodontid lineage, this species illustrates the diversity of feeding strategies in ancient oceans. The fossil shows how whales adapted from land mammals to aquatic predators with specialized hunting features. Examining the whale skull helps researchers trace evolutionary steps toward modern whales, highlighting the shift from active predation to filter feeding. Fossils like this illuminate the ecological pressures that shaped marine life millions of years ago.The broader importance of fossil whale skullsDiscoveries like this fossil whale skull highlight the value of fossils in studying life’s history. Whale skulls are rarely preserved due to oceanic erosion, making this find exceptionally significant. Fossils allow scientists to analyze skull morphology, sensory adaptations, and feeding strategies in detail. By studying ancient whale fossils, researchers can better understand how whales responded to environmental changes over millions of years and trace the evolutionary lineage of today’s marine giants.The 26-million-year-old whale skull fossil of Janjucetus dullardi is a milestone in paleontology. Its well-preserved skull, teeth, and ear bones provide a window into the life of ancient predatory whales and their adaptations. Studying this fossil enhances our understanding of early whales, their hunting behaviors, and their ecological roles. Ongoing research into fossils like this continues to illuminate the complex history of marine life and the evolutionary path that led to the majestic whales we see in our oceans today.Also read| Toothpaste made from hair: A sustainable innovation to repair teeth naturallyAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Researchers successfully translated imagined words into text using brain implants and AI. The study, part of the BrainGate2 trial, demonstrated that brain signals for imagined speech are similar to those for attempted speech.  For decades, neuro-engineers have dreamed of helping people who have been cut off from the world of language. A disease like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, weakens the muscles in the airway. A stroke can kill neurons that normally relay commands for speaking. Perhaps, by implanting electrodes, scientists could record the brain's electric activity and translate that into spoken words.Now a team of researchers has made an important advance toward that goal. Previously they succeeded in decoding the signals produced when people tried to speak. In the new study, published Thursday in the journal Cell, their computer often made correct guesses when the subjects simply imagined saying words.Christian Herff, a neuroscientist at Maastricht University in the Netherlands who was not involved in the research, said the result went beyond the merely technological and shed light on the mystery of language. "It's a fantastic advance," Herff said. The new study is the latest result in a long-running clinical trial, called BrainGate2, that has already seen some remarkable successes.One participant, Casey Harrell, now uses his brain-machine interface to hold conversations. In 2023, after ALS had made his voice unintelligible, Harrell agreed to have electrodes implanted in his brain. A computer recorded the electrical activity from the implants as Harrell attempted to say different words. Over time, with the help of AI, the computer predicted 6,000 words, with 97.5% accuracy.But successes like this raised a troubling question: Could a computer accidentally record more than patients actually wanted to say?Could it eavesdrop on their inner voice? "We wanted to investigate if there was a risk of the system decoding words that weren't meant to be said aloud," said Erin Kunz, a neuroscientist at Stanford University and an author of the study. She and her colleagues also wondered if patients might actually prefer using inner speech.Kunz and her colleagues decided to investigate the mystery for themselves. The scientists gave participants seven different words, including "kite" and "day," then compared the brain signals when participants attempted to say the words and when they only imagined saying them.As it turned out, imagining a word produced a pattern of activity similar to that of trying to say it, but the signal was weaker. The computer did a good job of predicting which of the seven words the participants were thinking. For Harrell, it didn't do much better than a random guess would have, but for another participant it picked the right word more than 70% of the time.The researchers put the computer through more training, this time specifically on inner speech. Its performance improved significantly, including on Harrell. Now when the participants imagined saying entire sentences, such as "I don't know how long you've been here," the computer could accurately decode most of the words.Herff, who has done his own studies, was surprised that the experiment succeeded. Before, he would have said that inner speech is fundamentally different from the motor cortex signals that produce actual speech. "But in this study, they show that, for some people, it isn't that different," he said.Kunz emphasized that the computer's current performance involving inner speech would not be good enough to let people hold conversations. "The results are an initial proof of concept more than anything," she said. But she is optimistic that decoding inner speech could become the new standard for brain-computer interfaces. In recent trials, she and her colleagues have improved the computer's accuracy. "We haven't hit the ceiling yet," she said.

A chance find on an Australian beach has revealed a rare, entirely new species, Janjucetus dullardi, that could unlock new clues about whale evolution.The 25-million-year-old juvenile specimen, small enough to fit in a single bed, was identified in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. It had bulging, tennis-ball-sized eyes, a shark-like snout, and sharp teeth designed for hunting. “It was, let’s say, deceptively cute,” said Erich Fitzgerald, senior curator of vertebrate paleontology at Museums Victoria. “It might have looked like some weird mash-up between a whale, a seal and a Pokémon, but they were very much their own thing.”The partial skull, including ear bones and teeth, was found in 2019 along Victoria’s Jan Juc Beach, a site known for unusual whale fossils. Janjucetus dullardi is only the fourth species ever identified in the mammalodontid group, early whales that lived during the Oligocene Epoch, about 34–23 million years ago. These predators, around three metres long, were an early branch of the lineage that led to modern baleen whales, but looked radically different. “They may have had tiny little nubbins of legs just projecting as stumps,” Fitzgerald said, a mystery that will remain unless a more complete skeleton is found.The species name honours Ross Dullard, the amateur fossil hunter who spotted something black protruding from a cliff during a low-tide search. When he poked it, a tooth fell out. “I thought, geez, we’ve got something special here,” he said. Museums Victoria confirmed this week it was a new species. Dullard, a school principal, said the news was “the greatest 24 hours of my life,” describing rock-star treatment at work with “high fives coming left, right and centre.”This is the first mammalodontid found in Australia since 2006 and only the third in the country. Whale fossils of this quality are rare because most skeletons are lost to erosion, scavengers, and currents over millions of years. “It’s only the chosen few… that actually get preserved as fossils,” Fitzgerald noted.Researchers say Janjucetus dullardi could help reveal how early whales fed, moved, and adapted to ancient warm oceans, insights that could inform how modern marine life responds to climate change. Dullard plans to mark the occasion with a “fossil party” featuring cetacean-themed games and whale-shaped jello, to celebrate his nightmare Muppet find. “I’ve had sleepless nights,” he admitted. “I’ve dreamt about this whale.”About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Researchers used diamond anvil cells and X-ray diffraction to observe mineral behavior under extreme conditions, explaining seismic wave anomalies and linking deep mantle processes to plate tectonics, volcanism, and Earth's magnetic field. Something ‘big’ is moving inside Earth; here’s what scientists just found For decades, scientists have sought to unravel the mysteries hidden deep beneath Earth’s surface. One of the most puzzling regions has been the D" layer, located about 2,700 kilometres (1,700 miles) beneath the surface, at the boundary between the planet’s lower mantle and outer core. This zone has long been known for its unusual seismic properties, which have sparked debates about its composition and behaviour.Now, a groundbreaking study conducted by researchers at ETH Zurich has revealed that solid rock in this deep layer of Earth’s mantle can move like a fluid, while still maintaining its solid state. Led by Professor Motohiko Murakami, the research team has provided experimental evidence explaining how minerals in the D" layer align and deform over geological timescales. The findings, published in Communications Earth & Environment, shed new light on mantle convection, plate tectonics, volcanic activity, and even the generation of Earth’s magnetic field.Earth’s hidden D" layer finally comes into focusThe D" layer sits just above the outer core and plays a key role in the planet’s internal dynamics. It has been a focal point for geoscientists because seismic waves passing through it behave differently than expected, often travelling faster in some regions and slower in others. Understanding the cause of these variations has been a challenge, as conditions in this layer involve extreme pressures and temperatures that are difficult to replicate in laboratory experiments.To study the D" layer, Murakami’s team used diamond anvil cells—devices capable of generating pressures exceeding those found deep within Earth—and X-ray diffraction techniques to examine the atomic structure of minerals under such conditions.The researchers recreated the high-pressure, high-temperature environment of the D" layer and observed how minerals behaved. They used magnesium germanate crystals as an experimental analogue for mantle minerals because they exhibit similar structural properties but are easier to work with in the lab.Role of post-perovskite in mantle dynamicsThe study focused on post-perovskite, a high-pressure phase of the mineral perovskite that forms under the extreme conditions of the D" layer. Post-perovskite has unique structural properties that allow its crystals to align in specific patterns when subjected to geological stress over long periods.This alignment enables solid-state flow, a process in which solid rock deforms and moves like a viscous fluid without melting. Such movement plays a critical role in mantle convection—the slow circulation of rock that drives the movement of tectonic plates at Earth’s surface.Explaining seismic wave anomaliesOne of the major outcomes of the research is the explanation for why seismic waves can accelerate by up to seven percent when passing through certain regions of the D" layer. The alignment of post-perovskite crystals changes the way seismic energy travels through the rock, matching patterns observed in global seismological data.This discovery effectively resolves a long-standing puzzle in geophysics and provides a clear link between deep mantle mineral behaviour and surface-level seismic measurements.Impact on plate tectonics and volcanismThe movement of solid rock in the D" layer has significant implications for plate tectonics. Mantle plumes—columns of hot rock rising from deep within the Earth—can be guided by the alignment of post-perovskite minerals, directing heat and material toward the upper mantle and crust.These processes are responsible for creating volcanic hotspots such as those in Hawaii and Iceland. The study also helps explain how deep mantle processes influence the formation of mountain ranges and the activity along subduction zones where one tectonic plate slides beneath another.Connection to Earth’s magnetic fieldBeyond plate tectonics, the findings have important implications for understanding the geodynamo—the mechanism that generates Earth’s magnetic field. The distribution of heat from the deep mantle to the outer core affects convection within the liquid iron core, which in turn influences magnetic field generation.By showing how the D" layer channels heat through solid-state flow, the study reveals a previously underappreciated link between deep mantle processes and the stability and variations of Earth’s magnetic field over the past 200 million years. This breakthrough opens new pathways for future research into how Earth’s deep interior continues to shape the planet’s surface and long-term habitability.Methodology and experimental insightsMurakami’s team achieved their results by:Using diamond anvil cells to create pressures of hundreds of gigapascals, similar to those at the core-mantle boundary.Applying high-temperature lasers to simulate the intense heat found deep underground.Analysing the crystal structures with synchrotron X-ray diffraction to observe how minerals deform under such conditions.Studying magnesium germanate as a stand-in for mantle perovskite allows the researchers to observe mineral alignment and flow properties.Significance for Earth scienceThe discovery that solid rock can behave like a fluid deep within the Earth provides:A more complete model of mantle convection and its effects on surface geology.An explanation for seismic anomalies detected in the D" layer.New insights into the heat flow between Earth’s core and mantle.A better understanding of how mantle plumes form and influence volcanism.A link between deep Earth processes and magnetic field generation.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

NASA captured 10 mysterious dark voids over remote island near Antarctica: What they reveal about the bizarre natural phenomena
In May 2016, NASA satellites detected ten unusual dark voids within cloud cover above Heard Island, a remote volcanic landmass. These formations, linked to von Kármán vortices, exhibited an atypical darkness, tight spiral structure, and a sharp directional change. This rare event provides scientists with a unique opportunity to study small-island wind effects and their impact on atmospheric patterns.

These formations, linked to von Kármán vortices, exhibited an atypical darkness, tight spiral structure, and a sharp directional change. This rare event provides scientists with a unique opportunity to study small-island wind effects and their impact on atmospheric patterns.  NASA satellites have captured a rare and eerie sight: 10 swirling “dark voids” puncturing thick cloud cover above Heard Island, an isolated volcanic landmass in the southern Indian Ocean, around 900 miles (1,500 km) north of Antarctica. The black patches, each averaging 8 miles (13 km) wide, formed in May 2016 and appear as part of an unusual atmospheric pattern. While these formations are linked to von Karman vortices, swirling air currents formed when wind passes around a tall obstacle, scientists note their unusual darkness, tight spiral structure, and dramatic change in direction make this event exceptional.The 10 dark voids show isolation’s impact on rare weatherThe 10 massive dark voids, captured in May 2016, are a striking example of how Heard Island’s extreme environment fuels rare atmospheric phenomena. This uninhabited Australian territory lies in one of the most remote and storm-battered regions on Earth, within the “Furious Fifties,” where powerful westerly winds dominate. Towering above the island is Mawson Peak, a 9,000-foot (2,700-meter) active volcano that disrupts airflow and cloud formations. The combination of volcanic terrain, fierce winds, and the island’s isolation provides perfect conditions for unusual cloud patterns, but seeing them so distinctly in satellite imagery is extraordinarily rare.Von Karman vortices: Nature’s swirling wind patternsVon Karman vortices form when fast-moving winds encounter an obstacle, such as an island or mountain, disrupting airflow and creating alternating spinning eddies on either side. These patterns are named after physicist Theodore von Karman, who first described the phenomenon. While von Karman vortices are occasionally observed in other regions of the world, such as the Canary Islands or Guadalupe Island, they usually appear as long, wispy trails of clouds. The vortices over Heard Island were instead marked by dense, perfectly circular gaps in the clouds, making this event stand out from typical occurrences.Unusual shape and sharp bend make it uniqueMost von Karman vortex streams appear smooth and aligned, flowing in a consistent direction. In contrast, the May 2016 formation over Heard Island bent sharply by nearly 90 degrees midstream, an abrupt shift likely triggered by intense westerly winds exceeding 50 mph (80 km/h). Additionally, the presence of thick clouds meant that only the vortex cores were visible, creating the illusion of black voids in the sky. This combination of strong winds, sudden directional change, and isolated visibility of the vortex centers is rarely seen in satellite imagery. Such extraordinary formations provide scientists with valuable insights into extreme weather behavior in isolated regions.A rare chance to study small-island wind effectsBecause Mawson Peak is smaller than most peaks that generate von Karman vortices, such patterns in this location are uncommon. This event offered researchers a rare opportunity to analyze how atmospheric flows interact with smaller volcanic landmasses. Studying these effects can improve understanding of how wind patterns influence global weather systems, climate, and even the transport of airborne particles across oceans. The Heard Island vortices also highlight how relatively minor topographic features can cause significant disturbances in large-scale airflow under the right conditions.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

This follows closely after an Indian astronaut's visit to the International Space Station. (Photo: X) NEW DELHI: In a landmark achievement, India has successfully sent its aquanauts to depths of over 5,000 metres in the North Atlantic Ocean.The mission marked a major step towards the country’s Deep Ocean Mission, also known as Samudrayaan. The feat comes just weeks after Shubhanshu Shukla became the first Indian to reach the International Space Station.Historic Moment: Shubhanshu Shukla Touches Down Earth With Spashdown Off U.S. Coast | Axiom-4The expedition was carried out in collaboration with France and involved two Indian aquanauts who completed separate deep dives in the French submersible Nautile earlier this month.PollWhich achievement do you think is more significant for India's scientific progress?Diving over 5,000 metres in the oceanReaching the International Space StationOn 5 August, Raju Ramesh, a scientist at the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), descended 4,025 metres. A record-setting 5,002-metre dive by retired Navy Commander Jatinder Pal Singh the next day followed this.Union Earth Sciences Minister Jitendra Singh said, "We have an Indian going into space and an Indian going into the deep ocean almost simultaneously." He called it part of India’s “double conquest” in underexplored frontiers, which he believes will contribute to the country’s economic growth.The minister added that PM Narendra Modi has shown a strong interest in the Deep Ocean Mission and blue economy.The Deep Ocean Mission, cleared by the Union Cabinet in 2021, covers crewed and uncrewed submersibles, deep-sea mining technology, biodiversity research and ocean-based energy projects. It aims to explore and utilise resources within India’s Exclusive Economic Zone and continental shelf.Matsya 6000M Ravichandran, Secretary in the ministry of Earth sciences, said the Deep Ocean Mission was carried out to gain firsthand experience before India tries the same with its own submersible, Matsya 6000. "One of the verticals of the DOM aims to develop technology to harness non-living ocean resources and a submersible which can carry humans to the deepest parts of the ocean for exploration," he said.The Matsya 6000, likely to be ready by December 2027, will carry three people to depths of 6,000 metres inside a titanium alloy sphere. It will have scientific instruments, communication systems and safety features with emergency endurance of up to 96 hours.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Source: X NASA astronaut Don Pettit has shared a striking near-infrared image of the Ganga River delta on X (formerly Twitter), captured during his Expedition 73 mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Posted on social media, the image provides a rare, high-contrast perspective of the world’s largest river delta, showcasing the vast, fertile landscapes across eastern India and Bangladesh. The photograph highlights the power of space-based observation in understanding Earth’s geography and the delicate ecosystems that sustain millions of people in the region.NASA astronaut captures Ganga river delta: Near-infrared photography reveals hidden ecosystem featuresPettit captured the delta using near-infrared photography, a technique that highlights features invisible to the human eye. Healthy vegetation appears luminous, while rivers, marshes, and agricultural land stand out with remarkable clarity. Scientists use these images to monitor plant health, water distribution, and environmental changes over time. By revealing fine details of the landscape, near-infrared photography allows researchers to track the effects of climate change, urbanisation, and deforestation, providing crucial data to protect this vital ecosystem.Accompanying the image, Pettit described the region as “the largest river delta on Earth,” underscoring both its geographical significance and natural splendour. The photograph quickly drew admiration from scientists, nature lovers, and photography enthusiasts alike and was praised for blending technical precision with artistic expression.Beyond its scientific value, Pettit’s photograph has captured attention for its visual appeal. The glowing greenery, winding rivers, and patchwork of farmland create a composition that blends art and science seamlessly. Social media users and science communities alike have praised the image, noting both its technical precision and aesthetic beauty. Pettit’s work highlights how space photography can inspire curiosity and appreciation for Earth’s landscapes, offering a perspective rarely seen from the ground.The Ganga-Brahmaputra delta: Asia’s largest river delta and vital biodiversity hotspotThe Ganga or Ganges delta, also called the Bengal Delta or Sundarbans Delta, covers more than 100,000 square kilometres and flows into the Bay of Bengal. It is home to millions who depend on its rich soils for agriculture, and it contains the UNESCO-listed Sundarbans mangrove forest. This unique ecosystem provides a habitat for endangered species like the Bengal tiger and supports biodiversity through its dense forests and interwoven waterways. Seasonal flooding replenishes nutrients in the soil, creating highly productive farmland, but also poses challenges for communities living in the delta.The Ganga river delta: Vital ecosystem and environmental stabilityThe Ganga river delta is not only vital for human livelihoods but also plays a crucial role in environmental stability. Its wetlands act as natural buffers against floods, while mangroves prevent coastal erosion and storm damage. These tools also assist in assessing biodiversity, identifying areas of habitat loss, and planning sustainable conservation efforts to protect both wildlife and local communities. Satellite and aerial imagery help scientists monitor these ecosystems, track seasonal flooding, and study the impact of climate change. Pettit’s near-infrared photograph contributes to this research by providing a detailed view of vegetation and land use, complementing other scientific tools used to safeguard the delta’s delicate balance.NASA astronaut Don Pettit’s near-infrared images of the Ganga river delta provide a striking perspective on one of the world’s most vital and expansive ecosystems. Covering over 100,000 square kilometres, the delta sustains millions of people, supports rich biodiversity, and safeguards coastal regions from natural disasters. Pettit’s work combines scientific observation with artistic vision, emphasising the importance of monitoring waterways, vegetation, and ecological health from space. Such imagery not only showcases the beauty and fragility of our planet but also inspires greater environmental awareness, highlighting the urgent need for conservation and fostering a deeper global appreciation of Earth’s natural landscapes.Also Read: NASA and Google collaborating together to develop AI medical assistant to boost astronaut health on Moon and Mars missionsAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

He was aided by Tiffany Fowler and Shae Saur. The stolen rocks were valued at $21 million. Roberts claimed it was for love, but the FBI found he planned to sell them. Roberts and his accomplices were arrested. The heist damaged scientific research. Source: LADbible In one of the most audacious and bizarre crimes in NASA history, Thad Roberts, a 24-year-old intern, stole moon rocks valued at $21 million in 2002, driven by romance rather than greed. Alongside his girlfriend Tiffany Fowler and fellow intern Shae Saur, Roberts executed a meticulously planned burglary at Houston’s Johnson Space Center, using authentic NASA badges, rewired security cameras, and Neoprene suits to bypass alarms. Their theft of 17 pounds of lunar samples included historic moon rocks from Apollo missions 1969–1972. While Roberts claimed the act was “for love,” the FBI revealed he had attempted to sell the rocks secretly online. This extraordinary heist destroyed priceless scientific research, embarrassed NASA, and shocked the world, blending science, crime, and obsession in an unforgettable story.$21 million moon rock theft at Johnson Space Center shocks scientists worldwideOn a July night in 2002, Roberts, Fowler, and Saur infiltrated Building 31 at Johnson Space Center. Roberts and Fowler donned Neoprene bodysuits, which allowed them to bypass thermal alarms, while Saur acted as a lookout. Using a power saw, they cracked open a 601-pound safe containing moon rocks and meteorites, including samples from every Apollo mission, many of which were irreplaceable and scientifically invaluable. The stolen lunar samples were worth approximately $21 million and represented decades of scientific research, experimentation, and NASA missions. The planning and execution demonstrated not only audacity but also technical sophistication, showing how a combination of insider knowledge, meticulous preparation, and determination can circumvent the most secure facilities. Source: Live ScienceWho is Thad Roberts? From NASA Intern to mastermind behind the $21 million moon rock theftThad Roberts graduated from the University of Utah with a triple degree in physics, geology, and geophysics, making him highly qualified to work at NASA. He met Tiffany Fowler, a 22-year-old stem cell researcher, and the couple quickly became romantically involved. Roberts reportedly told Fowler he wanted to “give her the moon,” framing the theft as a grand romantic gesture. According to People.com , the FBI considered financial motives, Roberts maintained that the act symbolized devotion rather than profit.Moon rock theft ends with FBI arrests and millions in NASA lunar samples lostRoberts and Fowler’s motivation went beyond romance—they symbolically “had sex on the moon” by placing stolen lunar samples under a blanket during intimate moments. Roberts later stated, “No one had ever had sex on the moon before,” underscoring the bizarre, almost surreal nature of the crime. While Roberts claimed love was the driving factor, the FBI discovered he had negotiated with a Belgian buyer willing to pay up to $5,000 per gram, proving the theft had financial implications.The heist came to a dramatic end when Roberts and Fowler traveled to Orlando to meet the potential buyer, only to be apprehended by undercover FBI agents. Saur and Gordon McWhorter, who helped arrange the sale, were arrested shortly afterward. The investigation revealed that the theft had caused irreversible damage: the moon rocks were now “virtually useless to the scientific community,” and three decades of NASA research notes were destroyed as reported.Moon rock theft from NASA leads to jail, house arrest, and finesThad Roberts pleaded guilty to the theft of moon rocks and other NASA artifacts, serving over six years of an eight-year prison sentence before his release in 2008. Tiffany Fowler and Shae Saur received house arrest, community service, and were required to pay restitution to NASA. Gordon McWhorter was convicted at trial for his involvement in the theft and sentenced to six years in prison. The case highlighted serious security breaches and led to stricter controls on NASA’s valuable collections.Also Read | NASA and Google collaborating together to boost astronaut health on Moon and Mars missionsAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Bermuda Triangle ‘mystery’ solved? Scientist explains the real cause behind vanishings of ships and planes
The Bermuda Triangle's infamous reputation for unexplained disappearances is largely unfounded, according to scientist Karl Kruszelnicki and supported by NOAA and Lloyd's of London. The region's high traffic volume, combined with challenging environmental conditions like the Gulf Stream and frequent storms, accounts for the incidents. Human error and equipment failure also play significant roles, debunking myths of supernatural forces.

Scientist explains the real cause behind vanishings of ships and planesTOI Science Desk / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Updated: Aug 14, 2025, 10:01 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLargeThe Bermuda Triangle's infamous reputation for unexplained disappearances is largely unfounded, according to scientist Karl Kruszelnicki and supported by NOAA and Lloyd's of London. The region's high traffic volume, combined with challenging environmental conditions like the Gulf Stream and frequent storms, accounts for the incidents. Human error and equipment failure also play significant roles, debunking myths of supernatural forces. Image: Getty Images  For decades, the Bermuda Triangle, the stretch of ocean roughly bounded by Miami, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico, has been the subject of mystery, fear, and speculation. From tales of ships vanishing without a trace to aircraft disappearing mid-flight, the region has inspired theories about supernatural forces, alien abductions, and even time warps. But according to Australian scientist Karl Kruszelnicki, backed by research from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Lloyd’s of London, these myths do not hold up. Far from being a cursed zone, the Bermuda Triangle’s so-called mysteries can be explained by natural environmental conditions, human error, and statistical probability. The truth, Kruszelnicki emphasizes, is far less otherworldly and far more rooted in the realities of nature and navigation.Bermuda Triangle poses no greater risk than other oceansKruszelnicki, supported by NOAA and Lloyd’s of London, has long maintained that the Bermuda Triangle is no more dangerous than any other ocean region. Disappearances occur at roughly the same proportional rate as elsewhere in the world’s waters. As noted by Kruszelnicki, the higher number of incidents is largely due to the Triangle being one of the busiest shipping and flight corridors in the world, where heavy traffic naturally means more recorded accidents. Statistical data confirms that when the volume of vessels and aircraft is taken into account, the accident rate is completely ordinary. This directly challenges the very foundation of the Triangle’s mythical reputation.Environmental and navigational challenges of 'Bermuda Triangle'According to Kruszelnicki, the geography and weather patterns of the Bermuda Triangle create conditions that can challenge even experienced navigators. The Gulf Stream, a powerful ocean current, can cause sudden changes in weather, generate violent storms, and push vessels off course within minutes. The region is also prone to tropical storms, hurricanes, waterspouts, and rogue waves that can overwhelm ships and planes without warning. Numerous islands and coral reefs make for hazardous, shallow navigation routes, increasing the risk of grounding or collision. Kruszelnicki also points out that certain areas experience magnetic anomalies where compasses may point to true north instead of magnetic north, leading to potential navigation errors. Furthermore, unpredictable microbursts and rapidly forming squalls can make navigation extremely hazardous, even for experienced crews. Sudden changes in visibility and wind patterns have historically contributed to numerous near-miss incidents in the area. When all these factors combine, even a minor miscalculation can turn deadly.Human error and equipment failureAs Kruszelnicki explains, a significant number of accidents in the Bermuda Triangle can be traced to pilot or captain mistakes, faulty equipment, or outdated forecasting methods. These human and technical shortcomings often occur alongside the already challenging weather and navigational conditions of the region. In earlier decades, limited communication systems and slower emergency response times meant that vessels or aircraft in trouble had little chance of rescue. Even today, with advanced technology, mistakes and malfunctions can quickly escalate into disasters when compounded by sudden storms or rough seas. Kruszelnicki stresses that the human factor is often underestimated in popular explanations of the Triangle’s incidents.Origins of the myth of the Bermuda Triangle The term “Bermuda Triangle” was first coined in 1963 by writer Vincent Gaddis, who linked the region to a series of unexplained disappearances. His writings sparked public curiosity, but the myth gained massive momentum in 1974 when author Charles Berlitz published a bestselling book that embellished these stories with speculation about Atlantis, alien abductions, and other sensational claims. Kruszelnicki has often criticized such accounts for their lack of credible evidence and reliance on anecdotal storytelling. The entertainment value of the myth overshadowed scientific explanations, cementing its place in pop culture for generations despite the absence of verifiable proof.Famous anecdote – the Bruce Gernon storyIn 1970, pilot Bruce Gernon reported encountering a strange tunnel-like cloud while flying through the Bermuda Triangle. He claimed his instruments malfunctioned, and upon exiting the cloud, he experienced a time discrepancy of about 30 minutes. The story has been widely discussed in books, documentaries, and paranormal circles, with some suggesting it could be evidence of a time warp. Kruszelnicki, however, remains skeptical, noting that the account is anecdotal and lacks corroborating evidence. Many experts, including Kruszelnicki, believe it could be explained by meteorological phenomena such as unusual cloud formations or optical illusions.Scientific consensus over Bermuda TriangleThe conclusion from NOAA, the US Navy, and Lloyd’s of London — all echoed by Kruszelnicki — is clear: the Bermuda Triangle is not more hazardous than any other heavily traveled ocean region. The so-called mystery is a product of natural hazards, geographic challenges, human mistakes, and decades of exaggerated storytelling. Statistically, the accident rates are consistent with those in other busy maritime and aviation areas. While the legend of the Bermuda Triangle may continue to inspire curiosity and creativity, the evidence, as Kruszelnicki emphasizes, points to a reality grounded in science, not the supernatural. Ultimately, the Bermuda Triangle’s greatest power lies not in sinking ships, but in captivating imaginations. It is a reminder that mystery often thrives where facts are overlooked, and that reality can be just as fascinating as myth.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

This ancient water, isolated for millennia, provides unprecedented insights into Earth's early conditions and potential for life in extreme environments. Professor Barbara Sherwood Lollar's team's findings challenge existing assumptions and open new avenues for astrobiological research.  In 2016, scientists discovered the oldest water on Earth deep within a Canadian mine, estimated to be over 2 billion years old. This rare water had been trapped underground, isolated from surface influences, offering unique insights into Earth’s ancient geological past and extreme environments. Professor Barbara Sherwood Lollar and her team made this remarkable discovery in the Kidd Creek Mine in Ontario, Canada. The water's extraordinary age and composition have important implications for understanding subterranean ecosystems and the possibility of life in harsh conditions, including on other planets.This finding marks a groundbreaking moment in geology and astrobiology, revealing how Earth’s deepest waters can hold secrets from billions of years ago.Discovery of the oldest water on Earth in Kidd Creek MineThe oldest water on Earth was uncovered at a depth of about 3 kilometers in the Kidd Creek Mine, Ontario. This water had remained sealed away for roughly 1.5 to 2.6 billion years, surpassing previous finds of ancient water worldwide. The research team, led by geologist Barbara Sherwood Lollar, tested the water’s age using isotopic analysis, confirming its unprecedented age. The longevity and isolation of this water make it a living snapshot of early Earth conditions, preserved untouched for billions of years.This groundbreaking discovery and detailed scientific analysis were published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications in 2014, offering a comprehensive look at the water’s age, chemistry, and significance. The findings challenge previous assumptions about Earth’s hydrological cycles and open new questions about the movement and preservation of water in the planet’s deep crust.Scientific importance of the oldest water on earth discoveryFinding the oldest water on Earth has major scientific significance. It offers clues about how microbial life could survive in isolated environments for billions of years, far from sunlight. This challenges previous assumptions about life’s limits on Earth and extends hope for discovering life in similar extraterrestrial environments, such as Mars or icy moons like Europa. The high salinity and unique chemical composition of this ancient water also provide insight into geological processes that occurred billions of years ago. These findings expand our understanding of Earth’s deep biosphere and the resilience of life. Moreover, studying such ancient water helps scientists understand how life might adapt to extreme conditions, pushing the boundaries of astrobiology and earth sciences.Tasting the oldest water on earth: A geologist’s unique experienceIn a remarkable gesture, Professor Sherwood Lollar tasted the oldest water on Earth herself.

Woman astronomer paid 30 cents an hour: unlocked cosmic distances; still missed out on Nobel Prize
Henrietta Swan Leavitt worked as a Harvard “computer” earning just 30 cents an hour, yet her groundbreaking discovery of the period-luminosity relationship transformed astronomy. Her work enabled scientists to measure cosmic distances and understand the expanding universe. Despite this monumental contribution, Leavitt never received a Nobel Prize during her lifetime, highlighting the challenges faced by women in science.

Her work enabled scientists to measure cosmic distances and understand the expanding universe. Despite this monumental contribution, Leavitt never received a Nobel Prize during her lifetime, highlighting the challenges faced by women in science.  Henrietta Swan Leavitt, an American astronomer whose groundbreaking discovery revolutionized how we measure the cosmos. Born in 1868, Leavitt began working at the Harvard College Observatory at a time when women were excluded from operating telescopes and instead employed as “computers” to analyze astronomical data. Despite earning just 30 cents an hour, her dedication and meticulous research led to one of the most important astronomical breakthroughs of the 20th century.In 1908, Leavitt discovered the period-luminosity relationship of Cepheid variable stars, showing a direct link between their brightness and pulsation period. This discovery became the key to measuring vast cosmic distances and ultimately helped astronomers like Edwin Hubble prove that the universe is expanding. Yet, despite her monumental contributions, Leavitt was never awarded a Nobel Prize during her lifetime.The discovery that changed astronomy foreverLeavitt’s key insight came from studying Cepheid variable stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, a galaxy assumed to be at a uniform distance from Earth. By carefully analyzing photographic plates, she found that the brightness of these stars varied in a predictable way tied to their pulsation period: the longer the period, the brighter the star. This relationship, now known as Leavitt’s Law, gave astronomers a powerful “standard candle,” an object of known brightness that can be used to calculate distances in space.Using this standard candle method, astronomers could measure how far away these stars and by extension, the galaxies they reside in actually were. This was a breakthrough in cosmic distance measurement, allowing scientists to determine the scale of the universe with unprecedented accuracy. Leavitt’s discovery became the foundation for Edwin Hubble’s later work in the 1920s where he used Cepheid variables to prove that the Milky Way was just one of many galaxies and that the universe itself was expanding.Overcoming barriers as a woman in scienceHenrietta Swan Leavitt’s career unfolded during a time when women faced serious discrimination in science. Women were largely relegated to supportive roles and denied opportunities such as telescope operation and academic recognition. Leavitt was paid a modest wage of about 30 cents an hour as a “computer” at Harvard, tasked with analyzing star data rather than conducting independent research.Despite these limitations, she showed extraordinary focus and persistence. Leavitt’s progressive hearing loss later in life made her work even more challenging, yet she continued her observations and calculations until her untimely death at the age of 53. Tragically, although her work was foundational for modern astronomy, she never received the Nobel Prize or equivalent accolades during her lifetime, and a posthumous nomination was not permitted.Legacy and lasting impact on cosmologyLeavitt’s period-luminosity relationship remains one of the cornerstones of astrophysics. It revolutionized the way distances to faraway celestial objects are measured, enabling astronomers to map the universe on a grand scale. This method underpins modern cosmology, helping scientists determine not only distances but also the rate at which the universe is expanding, key to the Big Bang theory.Edwin Hubble famously used Leavitt’s discovery to measure the distances to galaxies beyond the Milky Way and uncover the expanding nature of the universe, a milestone that forever changed humanity’s understanding of our place in the cosmos. Today, Henrietta Swan Leavitt is celebrated as a pioneering figure in astronomy whose brilliance and perseverance overcame societal and physical obstacles, leaving a profound legacy that continues to guide scientific exploration.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

These magnetic nanobots address tooth sensitivity. CalBots seal dentinal tubules using a bioceramic formula. Tests on extracted teeth show promising results. Animal trials demonstrate complete behavioral recovery. The team sees this as a step towards advanced nanorobotics. This innovation offers lasting relief for millions. The CalBots are made from safe materials.  BENGALURU: For millions of people, the sudden, sharp pain of tooth sensitivity can turn a sip of cold water into a jolt. Now, researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), in collaboration with Bengaluru-based deep-tech startup Theranautilus, have engineered “CalBots” – magnetic nanobots that can seal the problem at its source.As per IISc, CalBots are 400-nanometre particles loaded with a calcium silicate-based bioceramic formula, designed to travel deep inside dentinal tubules, the tiny tunnels in the tooth that lead to nerve endings. Guided by an external magnetic field, the bots can penetrate up to 500 micrometres into the tubules and self-assemble into stable, cement-like plugs that recreate the tooth’s natural barrier. One application, the team says, can offer lasting relief.Dental hypersensitivity affects nearly one in four people worldwide and occurs when enamel erosion or gum recession exposes the dentine layer beneath, IISc said. The tubules in dentine act as direct pathways to the nerves, which is why even mild temperature changes can trigger pain. “We didn’t want to create a slightly better version of what’s already out there. We wanted a technology that solves a real problem in a way that no one’s attempted before,” Shanmukh Peddi, postdoctoral researcher at IISc’s Centre for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE) and co-founder of Theranautilus. The team used a completely new class of bioceramic cement for the nanobots. While bioceramics are common in orthopaedics and dentistry, the formulation was designed specifically for hypersensitivity – to travel deeper and last longer.To test the approach, they worked first on extracted human teeth. “On these samples, we applied CalBots under a magnetic field for 20 minutes, during which the bots sealed the dentinal tubules by forming deep, stable plugs – a result confirmed through high-resolution imaging,” Peddi said.They then moved to animal trials, inducing sensitivity in mice and tracking their drinking behaviour. “Healthy mice drank both cold and room temperature water equally. But sensitive mice completely avoided cold water. After treatment, they started drinking it again. We saw 100% behavioural recovery. That was a big moment for us,” he said.The CalBots are made entirely from materials classified as ‘Generally Recognised as Safe’ and passed toxicity tests in mice. “This is a compelling demonstration of what nanorobotics can achieve, and how they could significantly impact future healthcare,” said Ambarish Ghosh, professor at CeNSE and one of the study’s corresponding authors.Debayan Dasgupta, former PhD student at CeNSE and co-founder of Theranautilus, sees this as part of a bigger technological shift. “We’ve created a regenerative, active nanomaterial – a step towards the kind of ‘tiny mechanical surgeons’ Richard Feynman once envisioned,” he said.Peddi added: “This is something we’ve worked towards silently for years. And the fact that we’ve done it here, in India, makes us very happy.”About the AuthorChethan KumarChethan Kumar is a Senior Assistant Editor with the Times of India.

Though smaller than initially thought, it remains the largest interstellar visitor known. Confirmed as a comet with a glowing tail, 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be twice as old as our solar system, offering a glimpse into the early universe.  NASA has revealed exciting new information about a mysterious interstellar object called 3I/ATLAS, speeding through our solar system at extraordinary velocities. First detected on July 1, this visitor from beyond our star system has fascinated scientists globally with its astonishing speed of 130,000 miles per hour and intriguing characteristics. Recent observations from the Hubble Space Telescope have captured the clearest images to date, offering key insights into its size, makeup, and path. These discoveries represent a significant advancement in our understanding of these rare travelers crossing the galaxy into our cosmic neighborhood.NASA confirms 3I/ATLAS as the fastest interstellar object ever detectedNASA’s Hubble Space Telescope observations have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is travelling through our solar system at an extraordinary speed of 130,000 miles per hour (209,000 km/h), making it the fastest interstellar object ever recorded. This speed far exceeds that of previous interstellar visitors such as ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. Scientists explain that the object’s velocity is the result of billions of years of gravitational interactions, known as the “gravitational slingshot effect,” where passing stars, planets, and nebulae impart additional momentum to the comet. This extreme speed means the object is only briefly visible as it races through, providing a fleeting window of opportunity for study. NASA’s continuous monitoring aims to capture as much data as possible during its swift passage.Image: Daily MailSize estimates refined: NASA reveals 3I/ATLAS is smaller but still immenseInitial observations by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory suggested that 3I/ATLAS’s icy core might be around seven miles (11.2 km) wide. However, NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has now refined these estimates, revealing that the core is smaller — at most 3.5 miles (5.6 km) across, and possibly as little as 1,000 feet (320 meters) in diameter. Despite being smaller than first believed, this still makes 3I/ATLAS the largest interstellar object ever discovered, dwarfing the next largest known visitor by up to 14 times. The high-resolution images also highlight the comet’s glowing gas halo, which had made it appear larger in earlier, less detailed observations. Understanding the true size helps scientists model its composition and behavior as it interacts with solar radiation.NASA confirms 3I/ATLAS’s cometary nature and its spectacular glowing tailThanks to NASA’s powerful telescopes, scientists have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is not a solid rock but a comet — a chunk of ice, frozen gases, and dust surrounded by a halo of evaporating material. The Hubble images reveal a dust plume streaming from the side of the comet heated by the Sun, along with a faint tail trailing behind it. This tail is formed as the comet’s surface warms up, causing ice to vaporize and release gas and dust into space, creating the characteristic glowing appearance. This phenomenon is similar to that seen in comets within our solar system, but 3I/ATLAS’s interstellar origin and extreme speed make it a rare and valuable subject for study. NASA expects the tail and dust plume to become more pronounced as the object approaches its closest point to the Sun. Scientists hope continued observation will shed light on the comet’s chemical composition, helping reveal clues about its interstellar origins. 3I/ATLAS offers humanity a fleeting glimpse into the mysteries of other star systems, carrying secrets older than our Sun itself.Ancient traveler: NASA estimates 3I/ATLAS is twice as old as our solar systemOne of the most astonishing revelations from NASA’s studies is the estimated age of 3I/ATLAS. Scientific analysis suggests this object has been orbiting the Milky Way for at least eight billion years — roughly twice the age of our own 4.6 billion-year-old solar system. This implies 3I/ATLAS formed long before our Sun and planets came into existence, making it a true cosmic relic. Its journey through the galaxy has likely included multiple gravitational encounters with stars and interstellar clouds, which may have shaped its trajectory and speed. Studying such an ancient object offers scientists a unique glimpse into the conditions and materials present in the early universe and helps refine models of galactic evolution. Its fleeting passage is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to study a messenger from the galaxy’s distant past. NASA researchers emphasize that each discovery from 3I/ATLAS brings us closer to understanding how planetary systems form and evolve across the galaxy.Safe passage confirmed by NASA: No threat to EarthDespite its immense speed and close approach to the Sun, NASA has assured the public that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth. The comet will reach its closest point to the Sun in late October, passing just inside the orbit of Mars at about 130 million miles (210 million kilometers). Crucially, it will be on the opposite side of the Sun relative to Earth during this time, ensuring no risk of collision or gravitational disturbance. NASA continues to monitor the comet’s trajectory precisely, as the interaction with the Sun’s heat may slightly alter its path. After passing the Sun, 3I/ATLAS will head back out into interstellar space, continuing its long journey through the galaxy. This may be humanity’s only chance to witness this ancient traveler before it disappears forever into the cosmic void. Its fleeting visit serves as a reminder of the vast, mysterious, and ever-changing nature of our universe.A new era of discovery: NASA leads the charge in interstellar object research3I/ATLAS marks only the third confirmed interstellar object ever detected, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. NASA’s advancements in telescope technology, sky surveys, and space observatories like Hubble have ushered in a new era of interstellar discovery. Researchers expect that as survey instruments become more sensitive and comprehensive, the frequency of detecting such visitors will increase. NASA plans to utilize not only Hubble but also the James Webb Space Telescope, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory to study 3I/ATLAS in multiple wavelengths. This will allow scientists to capture unprecedented data on the object's composition and interaction with the solar environment. These coordinated observations are crucial for building a more complete picture of interstellar objects and their origins. This coordinated effort will deepen our understanding of the composition, origin, and behavior of interstellar objects and their role in the cosmic ecosystem.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

These massive structures, sculpted by ancient underwater avalanches, indicate the Atlantic Ocean connected earlier than previously thought. This discovery provides insights into Cretaceous climate shifts and tectonic movements, offering crucial data for modern geology and climate science.  Buried nearly a kilometre beneath the Atlantic seabed west of Guinea-Bissau lies a geological time-capsule: gigantic 117-million-year-old mud waves sculpted by dense, underwater avalanches. A new study published in Global and Planetary Change reveals that these ancient structures were formed when early Atlantic waters carved through the Earth’s crust, much earlier than previously believed. This groundbreaking discovery reshapes our understanding of Atlantic Ocean formation, offers fresh perspectives on Cretaceous climate shifts, and provides crucial clues to tectonic movements that governed our planet’s evolving geography. From deep-sea sediment patterns to global carbon cycles and ocean circulation, these mud waves, once hidden, now tell a story with far-reaching implications for modern geology and climate science.Underwater mud waves push the Atlantic's birth date back to 117 million years agoRecent research published in Global and Planetary Change (2025) by Duarte, Nicholson, and colleagues has shed new light on the early history of the Atlantic Ocean. Using a combination of modern seismic imaging and archived drilling data from 1975, the team identified a series of massive 117-million-year-old mud waves buried deep beneath the Atlantic seafloor. These geological giants, stretching over a kilometer in length and rising hundreds of meters high, were formed when dense, salty water from the young North Atlantic spilled into the deeper southern basins, creating powerful underwater currents. The composition and layering of these mud waves reveal that such flows occurred far earlier than previously believed, suggesting that the Equatorial Atlantic Gateway, the oceanic passage linking the northern and southern Atlantic opened sooner than most geological models predicted. This pushes back the estimated timeline of when the Atlantic became a fully connected ocean, making the discovery a crucial piece in reconstructing Earth’s plate tectonic and oceanographic history. Not only does this finding refine our understanding of how and when the Atlantic took shape, but it also offers insights into the role of deep-water currents in shaping the seafloor over millions of years.Sediment patterns illuminate early ocean currents and climate changeThe formation of these 117-million-year-old mud waves was far more than an isolated ocean-floor event, it represented a profound turning point in Earth’s climate and geological history. When the young North Atlantic’s saline waters finally breached into the long-isolated southern basins, they encountered dense, carbon-rich deep waters that had been locked away for millions of years. This sudden mixing unleashed colossal underwater mud avalanches, cascading across the seabed with immense force and reshaping the ocean floor’s topography on a scale rarely seen in Earth’s past.The consequences reached far beyond the geology. This tectonic–oceanic upheaval likely interrupted one of the planet’s most important climate-regulating processes: the long-term burial of carbon in marine sediments. By disturbing these ancient, carbon-heavy layers, the event may have kept vast amounts of greenhouse gases circulating in the atmosphere, helping sustain the elevated global temperatures characteristic of the mid-Cretaceous, a period often referred to as one of Earth’s “greenhouse worlds.” Such persistent warmth not only influenced ocean chemistry and circulation but also shaped the evolution and distribution of marine life for millions of years afterward.Understanding precisely when the Equatorial Atlantic Gateway opened is therefore critical. It marks the moment the Atlantic transitioned from a series of isolated basins into a fully connected ocean, altering heat and nutrient flows on a global scale. By reconstructing this event, scientists can better model ancient ocean currents, climate feedback loops, and the deep-time mechanisms that still echo in today’s climate system. In essence, these mud waves are not just relics of a vanished seafloor, they are a geological signature of the forces that have shaped, and continue to shape, Earth’s climate trajectory.Why this discovery matters: from paleoceanography to climate modellingKnowing that the Atlantic began to take shape around 117 million years ago, evidence preserved in those colossal buried mud waves, significantly sharpens scientists’ ability to model ancient ocean behaviour, tectonic shifts, and climate feedback loops. This revised timeline offers a clearer window into how early ocean gateways controlled the movement of heat across the planet, regulated carbon sequestration in marine sediments, and set the stage for long-term cooling or warming trends.By tracing these deep-time processes, researchers can better understand the intricate relationship between ocean circulation and Earth’s climate system. Crucially, such knowledge is not confined to the past, it provides a framework for anticipating the effects of today’s oceanic changes. From accelerating polar ice melt to shifting global currents, the same mechanisms that once shaped the Cretaceous world could, in altered form, dictate the trajectory of our future climate.Also read| Study reveals nature's hardest teeth: Chitons inspire future material designAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Although there is still no specific therapeutic medicine, a vaccine has been developed and approved for use in certain parts of the world, but no licensed or approved dengue vaccines are available in India, a high-incidence country.Led by Sweden’s Karolinska Institute, the project involves researchers from eight European universities, five Indian institutions, a university from the US, and an NGO from Guatemala, all working in the field of public healthcare and medical research.The total project cost is estimated to be around Rs 90 crore. The EU has already sanctioned Euro 8 million (nearly Rs 81 crore). The balance will be funded by the Govt of India through the Dept of Biotechnology, Ujjwal Neogi, the coordinator for the project, also a senior lecturer at Karolinska Institute, told TOI.The EU partners are collaborating with several leading institutes in India that include Artemis Hospital and Max Hospital in New Delhi, Kasturba Medical College Hospital in Mangalore, Regional Centre for Biotechnology, Faridabad. The India part is being led by National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani in West Bengal. “We’re bringing together the brightest minds from Europe and India to understand the disease at a molecular level and design better tools for diagnosis and prevention,” Neogi from Karolinska Institute said.Stockholm-based Karolinska Institute is a 215-year-old world-leading medical research university that every year selects the Nobel Prize winner in physiology or medicine.The project has a dual objective. Primarily, it aims at better understanding the complete lifecycle of dengue infection: From the origin of the virus, to how it spreads in human beings to how it affects the human body. And then to come out with solutions so that the spread of this mosquito-induced disease could be contained, its impacts on human beings could be predicted during the early onset of the disease, and could be cured more effectively and quickly than now.With an estimated 100 million infections annually across 144 countries leading to over 10,000 deaths, this predominantly tropical disease is now spreading in Europe, mainly due to climate change, the project’s website noted.Another equally important objective of the project is to better understand how, in general, virus-induced pandemics spread and to prepare a blueprint for countering such incidents in future. The secondary objective of the project grew in importance in the backdrop of the Covid-induced global pandemic, researchers working in the project told TOI.From India’s side, the partners will make “original research contributions to the overall objectives of the program, that is pioneering innovative antiviral strategies to alleviate the burden of dengue infection while deepening our understanding of its complex pathogenesis through cutting-edge multi-modal technologies,” said Arindam Maitra, Professor, National Institute of Biomedical Genomics. Maitra is the chief coordinator for the researchers in India involved in this project.“The Indian team will collect, clinically characterize, undertake viral and host multiomics investigations to identify key factors facilitating severe disease and undertake research to come up with antiviral and immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies (that can regulate body's immune response) in collaboration with the EU team.” The ‘multiomics investigations’ here refer to an integrated data analysis of various DNA and RNA molecules within a dengue-infected person to identify novel biomarkers and improve disease classification.According to Neogi, among various cutting-edge research techniques, the project will use the brain-on-chip process. This is a relatively new research technique that simulates a human brain’s functions under a controlled environment in a laboratory. The researchers would be using the brain-on-chip process to see what happens to a human brain when the dengue virus infects the body. They expect the same technique could also give them some idea about combating the virus that is spread through mosquitoes. The technology will be transferred to India from the EU partners.About the primary takeaways for India from this project, Maitra said that given the increasing occurrence of severe disease and death following dengue virus infection in India and other parts of the globe, “this research initiative is expected to provide information and solutions which have the potential to play a major role in combating this challenge.”About the AuthorPartha SinhaPartha, senior assistant editor (markets) at The Times of India, Mumbai, covers the financial markets, mainly the stock market, mutual funds, banking and insurance sectors.

CMO-DA has shown promising results in simulated medical cases, achieving high diagnostic accuracy. This technology aims to provide reliable healthcare guidance in the challenging environment of deep space, potentially transforming healthcare worldwide. Source: Google Cloud As human space missions venture farther into deep space, the challenge of maintaining crew health grows increasingly complex. Unlike current missions aboard the International Space Station (ISS), where astronauts rely heavily on constant communication with Earth-based medical teams, regular medication supplies, and the option to return within six months, future journeys to the Moon, Mars, and beyond demand greater medical self-sufficiency. NASA and Google have teamed up to develop a breakthrough solution: an AI-powered medical assistant designed to support astronauts autonomously during extended spaceflight.NASA calls for AI medical assistant to support astronauts on Moon and Mars missionsWith missions extending beyond low Earth orbit, astronauts will face significant hurdles in healthcare management. Presently, ISS crews benefit from:Continuous real-time communication with ground-based medical expertsRoutine delivery of medicines and medical suppliesEvacuation options within months if medical emergencies ariseHowever, for lunar and Mars expeditions, communication delays can stretch up to 20 minutes each way, resupply missions will be infrequent, and emergency returns could take months or years. This scenario creates a pressing need for onboard medical autonomy, enabling astronauts to diagnose and treat health issues without immediate Earth-based assistance.Source: NASANASA and Google collaboration: Developing the Crew Medical Officer Digital Assistant (CMO-DA)To meet these challenges, NASA has partnered with Google to create the Crew Medical Officer Digital Assistant (CMO-DA) — an AI-driven medical tool designed for autonomous use by astronauts. This digital assistant is intended to serve as a virtual healthcare provider in space, bridging the gap when a medical doctor is not present onboard and communication with Earth is limited or delayed.Key features of CMO-DA:Multimodal Interface: Allows interaction via speech, text, and image inputs to facilitate easy use in space conditions.Cloud-Based Infrastructure: Operates within Google Cloud’s Vertex AI environment, enabling continuous application development and AI model training.Collaborative AI Model Development: NASA maintains ownership of the app’s source code and contributes actively to refine AI models alongside Google’s technology and third-party integrations.NASA’s AI medical assistant achieves high accuracy in testing key medical scenariosCMO-DA has already undergone preliminary testing using three simulated medical cases: ankle injury, flank pain, and ear pain. A panel comprising two physicians and one astronaut assessed the assistant’s performance across four key areas:Initial patient assessmentMedical history takingClinical reasoning and diagnosisTreatment planningThe results were encouraging, with diagnostic accuracies recorded as:88% for ankle injury74% for flank pain80% for ear painThese outcomes indicate strong potential for the assistant to provide reliable autonomous medical support during space missions.NASA’s plan to enhance CMO-DA for advanced space healthcareNASA plans an incremental development approach to continuously improve the CMO-DA system. Upcoming updates will focus on:Integrating medical device data: Incorporating inputs from onboard diagnostic tools for richer information.Enhancing situational awareness: Adapting AI algorithms to account for spaceflight-specific factors such as microgravity’s effects on human physiology.Contextualized medical advice: Delivering treatment recommendations tailored to the unique environment and conditions of deep space.This will enable the assistant to offer more precise, relevant, and timely healthcare guidance in the isolated and challenging environment of space.How NASA’s AI medical assistant could transform healthcare worldwideWhile designed for space, the implications of this AI-powered medical assistant extend far beyond astronaut health. David Cruley, a Google Public Sector engineer involved in the project, noted that although regulatory approval plans for terrestrial use are not yet confirmed, success in space missions could catalyze the adoption of similar AI tools on Earth.Possible benefits on Earth include:Improved medical care in remote and underserved areasEnhanced diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision supportIncreased accessibility to healthcare expertise in environments lacking specialistsNASA and Google also envision that lessons learned from CMO-DA’s development will accelerate innovation in the broader field of AI-driven medicine, ultimately improving patient care worldwide.Also Read | 4.56-billion-year-old McDonough meteorite older than Earth crashes into Georgia home; stuns scientistsAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Swift has cultivated a loyal fanbase through immersive experiences and reclaimed ownership of her music, disrupting industry norms. Her relentless work ethic and strategic decisions have propelled her into a powerful figure, offering a blueprint for success in any field.  Behind the glittering lights and chart-topping hits lies a carefully crafted strategy that has propelled Taylor Swift into one of the most powerful figures in the global entertainment industry. A NASA engineer has cracked the code behind Taylor Swift’s meteoric rise to global superstardom, revealing insights that extend far beyond her music. Sinéad O’Sullivan, a Harvard Business School graduate and seasoned rocket scientist, spent years analyzing Swift’s career and business strategies.In her upcoming book Good Ideas and Power Moves, O’Sullivan says that Swift’s success isn’t just about catchy songs or lucky breaks. Instead, it is the result of deliberate, strategic moves that anyone can learn from. From building a loyal fanbase to rewriting industry rules, Swift has crafted a personal brand and empire that generates billions and reshapes markets, offering a blueprint for success in any field.Taylor Swift’s strategic empire-building beyond musicO’Sullivan’s research highlights that Swift’s genius lies in her ability to construct entire worlds, not just songs. Taylor Swift has expertly crafted an expansive fan universe known as the “Swiftverse,” which goes far beyond her music to create an immersive, interactive experience for her fans, affectionately called Swifties. This world includes elaborate storytelling, hidden Easter eggs in lyrics, themed visuals, and multi-platform social media engagement that encourages fans to connect deeply, not only with her art but also with each other.This fosters a strong sense of community and loyalty, transforming fans into passionate supporters who actively drive her brand’s growth. The massive success of her Eras Tour exemplifies this phenomenon, injecting an estimated $5 billion into the US economy through ticket sales, travel, accommodations, merchandise, and job creation, especially boosting sectors like tourism and retail during a crucial post-pandemic recovery phase.Taylor Swift’s control over music rights and relentless work ethicA cornerstone of Swift’s empire is her strategic decision to reclaim ownership of her early work by re-recording her first six albums as “Taylor’s Version.” This move disrupted conventional music industry norms after her masters were sold without her consent, allowing her to regain financial control and send a powerful message about artist empowerment and creative agency.Beyond this, Swift’s meteoric rise is fueled by her relentless work ethic, unwavering self-belief, and deliberate choices. Balancing intensive touring, continuous music production, and broad business ventures, she demonstrates that meaningful success comes from taking risks, learning from failures, and staying true to one’s vision. Her journey offers a blueprint for aspiring entrepreneurs and artists on the importance of resilience, persistence, and owning one’s path to success.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Scientists are studying this biological marvel to inspire the creation of super-durable materials. This research could revolutionize industries by enabling the development of advanced cutting tools, biomedical implants, and self-repairing structures, mimicking nature's ingenious design. Source: The University of Chicago You’d expect the hardest teeth in nature to belong to sharks, crocodiles, or some ancient dino. But surprisingly the title goes to a slow-moving, algae-scraping mollusc called the chiton. This groundbreaking new study published in Science reveals that chitons, marine molluscs you’ve probably never heard of, grow teeth that aren’t just hard, they're harder than stainless steel, zirconium oxide, and even human enamel. And here’s the real kicker: they do it at room temperature, using a precise, protein-controlled biological system.Scientists say this process could inspire the next generation of supermaterials used in cutting tools, surgical implants, dental prosthetics, and protective coatings , all with nanoscale precision. Let’s dive into the science behind nature’s hardest, most magnetic teeth. Curious? Let’s break down what the study found and why it's got scientists (and engineers) geeking out.What are chitons and why do their teeth matter?Chitons are small, ancient marine molluscs that cling to rocks and feed by scraping algae off surfaces using a ribbon-like tongue called a radula. The teeth on this radula are constantly worn down and regrown and they happen to be the hardest known biological material on Earth, even stronger than enamel or bone.Scientists have long been fascinated by the strength of chiton teeth, but this new study reveals why they're so strong and how their structure could influence materials science.The science behind chiton teeth: Built to crushThe researchers used high-resolution electron microscopy and spectrometry to analyse the nanostructure of chiton teeth. What they found was extraordinary:The teeth contain magnetite, an iron-based mineral, arranged in a tightly packed, nanoscale crystalline structure.These crystals are embedded in a soft organic matrix, which offers both rigidity and flexibility, a rare combination in natural materials.This combination makes the teeth not just hard but incredibly wear-resistant, ideal for scraping rock surfaces without damage.Why this study could change future materialsThe implications of this research stretch far beyond marine biology. Materials inspired by chiton teeth could be used to:Build durable coatings for cutting tools, drills, and other high-friction equipmentCreate longer-lasting materials for aerospace or biomedical applicationsDevelop self-repairing synthetic structures that mimic how chitons regrow teethThe study's lead author, Dr. Erika Easterling, explained that nature often holds the blueprints for advanced engineering: "By studying organisms like chitons, we can reverse-engineer solutions for some of our toughest material challenges."Now that the microstructure of chiton teeth is better understood, researchers are working on synthetic replication using nanomaterials. The goal is to reproduce this biological architecture in labs and eventually at scale, creating next-gen materials that combine hardness, flexibility, and self-renewal.Nature's toughest teeth may soon inspire industrial revolutions, proving once again that biology often beats the lab in innovation.Also read| These 15 science facts are so bizarre, you'll think we're lying (but we're not)About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

The data for 2025 alone is a sign of things to come. A cruel summer as record wildfires scorch Europe Wildfires continue to burn across the south of Europe amid record-breaking summer heatwaves in many fire-prone regions. In some places, these fires have been exacerbated by wet spring months, which have helped vegetation growth capable of catching alight with ease during a dry summer.Already, an area equivalent to 1.5 times the size of Luxembourg — roughly 438,568 hectares — has burned across Europe in 2025. That figure is almost three times the size of fire damaged caused up to the same point in 2024.It comes as some parts of southern Europe suffer through multiple 40-degree (104 Fahrenheit) days, and prolonged heatwaves lasting a fortnight.The current summer has been described as the worst for wildfires in two decades.Where are the fires burning? What is the situation right now?"We're seeing extreme temperatures in large parts of Europe, records being broken of 40 degrees in many places," said Julie Berckmans, a climate scientist at the European Environmental Agency."Southern France, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Belgium, Netherlands, UK, are all hitting high temperatures [and] massive wildfires in Spain, Portugal, France, Greece, Turkey, Albania."In Spain, those fires have burned through an area the size of London already.Portugal is fighting its own fires, with around four thousand firefighters currently active across seven active sites. It has also been forced to request help from the European Union's firefighting forces.An even greater number of firefighters has been mobilized in Greece, which is battling 20 blazes during this peak fire season.Deaths have occurred in Spain, Portugal, Montenegro and Italy from fires and heat-related events this summer.It has been a severe fire seasonEurope uses data from its Copernicus satellite fleet to monitor fire activity, and collates the data via the European Forest Fires Information System (EFFIS).A substantial amount of fire damage in 2025 has already occured.More than 250,000 hectares more of land has burnt than the same time in 2024.There have more than 1,600 fires across Europe, compared to just under 1,100 last year.And new regions are also experiencing greater than usual fire activity.Spain, for instance, has seen twice as much of its territory burned-through compared to the 2006-2024 average. Romania has lost four times as much land to fires this year.Cyprus has been badly impacted. It could usually expect to see around 0.32% of its landmass burned each year. Already in 2025 it's 2.5% — nearly eight times more.But it's also the number of fires that is concerning. France has had nearly three times as many fires as average amid what has been the worst wildfire season for its southern regions in decades.More to come...The fallout of severe wildfires goes beyond land loss or human fatalities. Damage to ecosystems through vegetation loss, health impacts through smoke inhalation, and economic decline are all consequences of widespread fire events."It's about €2.5 billion [$2.9 billion] of damage lost every year in the EU," Berckmans told DW. "45,000 people on average were displaced due to wildfires from 2008 to 2023."The European Environment Agency's first climate risk assessment, published in 2024, found that urgent action is required to address the critical risk wildfires will pose to populations and infastructure and biodiversity in southern Europe."Wildfires are an urgent risk to address," said Berckmans. "It's also a major risk that needs more action now in the rest of Europe."As European fall approaches, the number of fires and the damage they cause should slow. However forecasting the length of fire danger season, and the behavior of fires themselves, is becoming more difficult.Climate change will not only generate warmer and drier conditions across southern Europe, it will also begin to change other dynamic factors.Faster and more volatile wind systems, for instance, will increase the challenge for fire management personnel to predict how blazes will behave. That puts the lives of emergency workers and civilians at greater risk."Picture a fire so fierce, so fast, and so unpredictable it seems alive, capable of reshaping the weather around it and leaping across kilometers in a heartbeat," said Antonio Lopez, an expert in wildfires at the University of Seville, Spain.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousNew blood pressure guideline by American Heart Association: Key takeawaysLifestyle‘Coolie’ star Shruti Haasan turns heads with her stunning style momentseEntertainmentAishwarya Khare’s off-screen chic lookstvIn pic: Radiant pictures of Shruti HaasanEntertainmentIn pics: Preity Mukhundhan’s stylish wardrobe collectionEntertainmentPallavi Gowda’s top 10 traditional lookstvSai Pallavi’s ethereal charmEntertainmentFatty liver disease: Warning signs one should not ignoreLifestyleJanhvi Kapoor’s mesmerising saree game is giving sleepless nights to other actresses!LifestyleA look at Sidharth Malhotra's dapper fashion momentsEntertainment Next123 Photostories  5 hints your friendship is costing your mental healthAkshay Kumar to Sourabh Raaj Jain : Actors who played Lord Krishna on screenWeird things snakes eat: From eggs to… themselves?

India is ahead in clean energy commitments, achieves 2030 goal five years early In what could be considered as a landmark moment for India's clean energy journey, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, from the ramparts of the Red Fort, on Friday announced that the nation has achieved its 50 per cent clean energy target in 2025 -- a full five years ahead of the 2030 deadline.Marking Independence Day celebrations, the Prime Minister announced and hailed the achievement as a pivotal step towards an Atmanirbhar Bharat in the energy sector, underscoring the country's transformation from a fossil-fuel-dependent importer to a global clean energy leader."When the world today expresses concern over global warming, I wish to tell the world that Bharat has resolved to achieve 50 per cent clean energy by 2030. That was our target for 2030. Look at the capability of my countrymen, look at their determination to fulfil the resolve of making Bharat developed--we achieved the 50 per cent clean energy target in 2025 itself, five years ahead of schedule. This is because we are as sensitive towards the world as we are responsible towards nature," PM Modi said on the occasion of 79th Independence.At COP26 held in 2021, India committed to an ambitious five-part "Panchamrit" pledge.This included reaching 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity, generating half of all energy requirements from renewables, and reducing emissions by 1 billion tonnes by 2030. India also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent and achieve net-zero emissions by 2070.According to the latest government data, India added a record 29.52 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity in 2024-25, taking total installed renewable energy (RE) capacity to 234.24 GW (excluding nuclear), up from 198.75 GW last year.Solar energy leads the charge, with installed capacity skyrocketing from just 2.82 GW in 2014 to 116.24 GW today, now accounting for nearly half of India's total RE capacity.Wind power follows at 51.67 GW, while large and small hydro contribute 54.72 GW combined. Biopower has also grown to 11.59 GW over the past decade.India now ranks 4th globally in total RE capacity, 3rd in solar power, and 4th in wind energy, boasting the world's fastest-growing renewable program.The clean energy surge has been powered by a suite of ambitious government reforms and programs.The PM-Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana, with a Rs 75,021 crore outlay, aims to provide free solar electricity to one crore households.As of August 14, 2025, over 17.24 lakh households have benefitted, with subsidies worth Rs 9,841.77 crore released. The scheme also introduced Model Solar Villages to promote decentralised clean power at the grassroots level.In agriculture, the PM-KUSUM scheme has installed over 8.53 lakh solar pumps, replacing diesel-powered systems and cutting an estimated 6.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.Beyond solar, India is expanding in wind, hydro, bioenergy, green hydrogen, and nuclear power. Offshore wind projects, backed by a Rs 7,453 crore viability gap funding scheme, are set to add 1 GW capacity off Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.The National Green Hydrogen Mission, with a Rs 19,744 crore budget, targets 5 million metric tonnes (MMT) annual production by 2030, along with 125 GW of new RE, Rs 8 lakh crore in investments, and 6 lakh jobs. Hydrogen hubs have been identified in Kandla, Paradip, and Tuticorin.In the nuclear sector, operational capacity has grown from 4,780 MW in 2014 to 8,780 MW across 25 reactors, with a remarkable 87 per cent plant load factor in 2024-25. Ten new reactors are already functional, and capacity is set to increase tenfold by 2047."The result is a virtuous cycle: local manufacturing creates jobs and resilience, competitive tariffs make clean energy affordable, and inclusive programs bring every citizen into the transition. As we look ahead to 2030 and beyond, India is not just meeting global commitments -- it is setting a new template for how a nation can grow, decarbonise, and remain self-reliant. In the journey from energy dependence to energy leadership, the momentum is unmistakable, and the destination is clear: an Atmanirbhar Bharat, powered by its own clean, green energy," the government said today, in a factsheet.With five years gained on its clean energy target, India is now firmly on track to meet, and potentially exceed, its 500 GW non-fossil capacity goal by 2030, positioning itself as a decisive force in the global fight against climate change.

But time is running out fast," he added. Representative image LONDON: A multi-million pound conservation programme in England helped save 150 struggling species but "time is running out" to halt the decline, the head of Natural England, which led the initiative, said Wednesday.The public body, responsible for protecting and enhancing England's natural environment, invested a £13 million ($17.6 million) grant in efforts to support animal and plant species such as water vole, oystercatcher, lady's slipper orchid, the hazel dormouse and Atlantic salmon. "From the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall to Cumbria and Northumberland, 63 different projects involving 78 partners have transformed landscapes and supported the recovery of 150 species, many of which were on the brink of national extinction, through research, captive breeding, habitat creation, and conservation translocations," the body said in a statement released Wednesday.More than 15,000 individual animals and plants were translocated to expand species territories under the projects, which ran from August 2023 to March 2025. Notable successes include the reintroduction of black grouse to the North Yorkshire Moors, northern England, and the return of the large marsh grasshopper to the Norfolk Broads in east England after an 85-year absence. Despite the achievements, the chair of Natural England Tony Juniper warned more needed to be done. "A rising number of nature recovery projects, both large and small, are making a huge difference up and down the country," he said in the press release."We know we can turn round species decline and improve ecosystems with the right targeted actions, the drive and the funding. But time is running out fast," he added.Juniper called for more projects, more volunteers and more investment, particularly from the private sector.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous10 creatures that can live inside volcanic zonesLifestyleYou’re probably a hater if you’re one of these zodiac signsastrologyHow to set up a planted aquarium at home and the types of fish to keep: 10-step guideLifestyle'Coolie': Rajinikanth to SoubinShahir'spay revealed!EntertainmentAlia Bhatt’s hairstylist warns against straightening damp hair: Know why we agree with himLifestyleZodiac signs who are known for their simplicityastrologyDO NOT ignore these warning signs of a heart attackLifestyleDipika Kakar’s top 10 gorgeous ethnic looks for festive seasontvJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than Wordstv Next123 Photostories  Janmashtami 2025: 5 savoury snacks perfect for fasting and feasting5 veggies to pair with Rajma (kidney beans) to boost its fiber contentThese foods can reduce the cooking time of meat5 last-minute weekend trips from Delhi you can plan right now!From Varsha to Divinesh: A look at the winners of Sa Re Ga Ma Pa TamilIndependence Day: Unveiling 10 rare pictures from India’s struggle for freedom7 foods to strictly avoid in monsoon seasonGuard deployed, protests erupt: National Guard steps up presence in Washington; 10 things to knowMovies that made us question everything we thought we knewSara Tendulkar’s protein drinks: How to make them and their benefits123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillVanessa BryantDwyane WadeKyrie lrvingNHL Trade RumorsRaj KundraWhy Roblox Get Banned in QatarMega Slowbro solo in Pokemon GOJohnny SomalisBrock Lesnar Net WorthTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteAir Arabia reports AED 415 million net profit in Q2 2025 despite regional disruptionsUAE heatwave alert: Temperatures to soar to 46°C in Dubai and Abu DhabiUAE: Etihad hits record 20.3 million passengers in 12 months for the first timeUkraine-Russia conflict: Zelenskyy arrives in London, meets UK PM Starmer ahead of Trump-Putin's Alaska summitWhat is David G.

KAOHSIUNG: Thousands of people sheltered and fishermen secured their boats across storm-battered southern Taiwan on Wednesday as Typhoon Podul intensified on its approach to the island.The typhoon is packing wind speeds of 155 kilometres (96 miles) per hour at its centre and "is strengthening", Central Weather Administration (CWA) forecaster Lin Ting-yi told AFP.Podul is on track to hit lightly populated Taitung County at around noon (0400 GMT) before sweeping across the island and into the Taiwan Strait."We are worried about this typhoon," Kaohsiung fisherman Huang Wei told AFP as he used more ropes to tie down his boat and checked on other vessels."We had already made general typhoon preparations yesterday, but this morning I woke up and saw news reports that the typhoon has intensified to be as strong as the last, (Typhoon) Krathon," Huang said."Last time, the two boats behind us weren't tied properly and hit my boat."Krathon slammed into Kaohsiung in October, with wind gusts of 162kph. Podul has gusts of 191kph, Lin said. More than 5,500 people have been evacuated from their homes ahead of Podul, disaster officials said Wednesday, as the typhoon threatens to pound central and southern regions that are still recovering from storms last month.Mountainous areas of Kaohsiung City and neighbouring Pingtung County, as well as Hualien and Taitung counties, could see torrential rain, the CWA said.All domestic flights across the island of 23 million people have been cancelled, along with dozens of international journeys.Many ferry services have been suspended and businesses and schools across the south closed.Typhoon Danas, which hit Taiwan in early July, killed two people and injured hundreds as the storm dumped more than 500mm (about 20 inches) of rain across the south over a weekend.That was followed by torrential rain from July 28 to August 4, with some areas recording more than Taiwan's rainfall of 2.1 metres for 2024.The week of bad weather left five people dead, three missing, and 78 injured, a disaster official said previously.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 expensive animal-shaped bags that’ll leave you almost shocked!Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?Maharashtra’s UNESCO World Heritage Sites and other iconic monuments for history loversRajinikanth completes 50 years in cinema: Lesser-known facts about the ‘Coolie’ star6 lizards that prove reptiles can be adorable123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

Representative image GENEVA: Talks on forging a landmark treaty to combat the scourge of plastic pollution were stumbling Saturday, with progress slow and countries wildly at odds on how far the proposed agreement should go.The negotiations, which opened on Tuesday, have four working days left to strike a legally-binding instrument that would tackle the growing problem choking the environment.In a blunt mid-way assessment, talks chair Luis Vayas Valdivieso warned the 184 countries negotiating at the United Nations that they had to get shifting to get a deal."Progress made has not been sufficient," Vayas told delegates."A real push to achieve our common goal is needed," the Ecuadoran diplomat said, adding that Thursday was not a just deadline but "a date by which we must deliver."Some articles still have unresolved issues and show little progress towards reaching a common understanding," Vayas lamented.The key fracture is between countries that want to focus on waste management and others who want a more ambitious treaty that also cuts production and eliminates use of the most toxic chemicals.And with the talks relying on finding consensus, it has become a game of brinkmanship.A diplomatic source told reporters that many informal meetings had been scrambled together for Sunday's day off to try and break the deadlock."If nothing changes, we won't get there," the source added.Battle of the bracketsCountries have reconvened in Geneva after the failure of the supposedly fifth and final round of negotiations in Busan, South Korea in 2024.After four days of talks, the draft text has ballooned from 22 to 35 pages -- with the number of brackets in the text going up near five-fold to almost 1,500 as countries insert a blizzard of conflicting wishes and ideas.The talks are mandated to look at the full life cycle of plastic, from production to pollution, but some countries are unhappy with such a wide scope.Kuwait spoke up for the so-called Like-Minded Group -- a nebulous cluster of mostly oil-producing nations which rejects production limits and wants to focus on treating waste."Let us agree on what we can agree. Consensus must be the basis of all our decisions," Kuwait insisted.Nudging in the same direction, Saudi Arabia, speaking for the Arab Group, said the responsible way ahead was to start considering what bits of the text "may not make it to the final outcome due to irreconcilable divergence".But given how little is truly agreed on, Uruguay warned that consensus "cannot be used as a justification to not achieve our objectives".Eirik Lindebjerg, global plastics adviser for the World Wide Fund for Nature, told AFP that the Like-Minded Group's proposal was "another attempt to make it a waste management agreement", and to stifle talks on reducing the amount of plastic in circulation.Path through the fogThe UN Environment Programme is hosting the talks and swiftly called a press conference after the stock-take session.UNEP executive director Inger Andersen said a deal was "really within our grasp, even though today it might not look so"."Despite the fog of negotiations I'm really encouraged," she told reporters, insisting: "There is a pathway to success."Vayas added: "We need to accelerate. We need a better rhythm in this and we need to also work in such a way that it will be clear that we will deliver by the end."Afterwards, Bjorn Beeler, executive director at IPEN, a global network aimed at limiting toxic chemicals, told AFP: "This whole process has not been able to take decisions and is still collecting ideas. We're sleepwalking towards a cliff and if we don't wake up, we're falling off."'Profits from poisoning'Plastic pollution is so ubiquitous that microplastics have been found on the highest mountain peaks, in the deepest ocean trench and scattered throughout almost every part of the human body.More than 400 million tonnes of plastic are produced globally each year, half of which is for single-use items.Plastic production is set to triple by 2060.Panama's negotiator Juan Monterrey Gomez took the floor to slam those countries wanting to stop the treaty from encompassing the entire life cycle of plastic.He said microplastics "are in our blood, in our lungs and in the first cry of a new-born child. Our bodies are living proof of a system that profits from poisoning us". "We cannot recycle our way out of this crisis."End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksGlobal Standard indexUS stocks todayIndia-US tariffIntel CEOMukesh AmbaniUS jobless dataRussia crude oilTop TrendingTyreek HillSelena GomezKim KardashianTaylor SwiftTravis KelceBill Belichicks GirlfriendNBA Trade RumorsDwyane WadesShannon SharpeMike VrabelTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteTyreek Hill, ex Keeta Vaccaro rush baby Capri to ER;

Climate heat extremes driving tropical bird decline: study
Tropical bird populations have plummeted not only due to deforestation but also extreme heat attributable to climate change, according to a study published on Monday in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.  Another study published in 2017 showed how some tropical hummingbirds are now forced to seek shade to regulate their temperature in extreme heat, cutting into the amount of time they can spend searching for life-sustaining nectar.

Another study published in 2017 showed how some tropical hummingbirds are now forced to seek shade to regulate their temperature in extreme heat, cutting into the amount of time they can spend searching for life-sustaining nectar.  Representative image PARIS: Tropical bird populations have plummeted not only due to deforestation but also extreme heat attributable to climate change, according to a study published on Monday in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. Intensifying temepratures caused a 25-38 percent reduction in tropical bird populations between 1950 and 2020, compared to a scenario without manmade global warming, scientists based in Europe and Australia reported. "The findings are pretty stark," lead author Maximilian Kotz, a researcher at the National Supercomputing Centre in Barcelona and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), told AFP.Bird populations in the tropics now face 30 days of heat extremes per year compared to three per year in the mid-20th century, he noted. "This has major consequences for how we think about biodiversity conservation," Kotz said by email. "Protecting pristine habitats is crucial, but without dealing with climate change it won't be enough for birds."Nearly half of all bird species are found in biodiversity-rich tropical regions. These often colourful animals perform essential services for ecosystems, such as dispersing plant seeds. Invasive species another threatBut birds living in these regions may already be "close to the limits" of their tolerance to high temperatures, which can cause heatstroke (hyperthermia) or dehydration. The overview study does not provide figures for individual species, but earlier literature is rich with examples of the devastating impact of rising temperatures.One documented the heat-related decline of birds in Panama, including the king quetzal, the red-crested quetzal, the two-coloured kingfisher and the aurora trogon. Another study published in 2017 showed how some tropical hummingbirds are now forced to seek shade to regulate their temperature in extreme heat, cutting into the amount of time they can spend searching for life-sustaining nectar. Extreme heat waves, which are becoming more frequent, represent a far greater threat than increases in average temperatures or rainfall, another result of human-induced climate change. Up to now, it has been assumed that the decline in bird populations worldwide was due mainly to other well-identified factors, especially habitat loss, pesticide use, hunting, and invasive species, especially snakes that snack on bird eggs and mosquitos carrying avian malaria. But the new findings "challenge the view that direct human pressures have so far been the dominant driver of impacts on bird populations compared to climate change in tropical regions," according to the authors. To reach this conclusion, they analysed observational data from more than 3,000 bird populations around the world and used statistical modelling to isolate the effects of extreme weather from other factors.The findings help complete the picture of tropical bird decline, noted Aimee Van Tatenhove, a post-doctoral fellow at Cornell University's Center for Avian Population Studies who was not involved in the study."Deforestation has an obvious impact -- trees are cut and habitat is destroyed," she told AFP. "We need long-term datasets like the authors used to understand how extreme temperatures impact avian populations.""This study is an important reminder that we need to continue examining different causes of population declines and apply those findings to conservation initiatives," she continued.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  From Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leavesTop 5 Getaways in North and South India to Work RemotelyFrom Cristiano Ronaldo’s million-dollar sparkler to Arjun Tendulkar’s intimate proposal: Celebrity engagements that created buzz in 2025Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 expensive animal-shaped bags that’ll leave you almost shocked!Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

Silopi, a city in the Sirnak province, is located around 10 kilometres from the Iraq and Syrian borders. It shattered the previous national high of 49.5 C recorded in August 2023 in the western province of Eskisehir. Turkey has faced weeks of scorching heat along with several wildfires. Fourteen people lost their lives battling blazes last month in the western part of the country. Hundreds of people were evacuated on Friday in the northwest province of Canakkale, where the busy Dardanelles Strait was closed to maritime traffic due to two raging fires.

Representative image (Image: AP) LAGRASSE: A wildfire in southern France slowed overnight into Wednesday after injuring nine people and burning through 11,000 hectares of vegetation, local officials said. The blaze, which started on Tuesday afternoon, is still threatening several villages in the aude department, where 1,500 firefighters have been battling to extinguish it."The fire is advancing in an area where all the conditions are ripe for it to progress. We are monitoring the edges and the back of the fire to prevent flare-ups," said Lucie Roesch, secretary general of the qude prefecture.She said firefighters are expecting to receive aerial support at dawn, but warned "this fire will keep us busy for several days. It's a long-term operation".The fire's advance slowed overnight due to high humidity levels, she added.One person was seriously burned and another injured, the prefecture said, adding that seven firefighters were also hurt. Camping grounds and one village were partially evacuated, and several local roads have been closed."All of the Nation's resources are mobilised," French president Emmanuel Macron said on X, while calling on people to exercise "the utmost caution".The qude department has seen an increase in areas burnt in recent years, aggravated by low rainfall and the removal of vineyards, which used to help break the progression of fires.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle10 baby names that mean creativity and visionLifestyleWhen looks can be deceptive: 10 ‘PRETTY’ killers in the animal worldLifestyleBirthday Special: Spine-chilling quotes of Alfred Hitchcock that will keep you up at nightLifestyleSet up a mini lotus pond at home with these easy tipsLifestyleAttractive looks of Srithika Saneeshtv10 creatures that can walk on waterLifestyleSheet masks out, Kareena Kapoor Khan’s DIY napkin mask inLifestyleBhagyashri Borse charms with her gorgeous outfitsEntertainmentMost affordable diesel cars under Rs 12 lakh: Kia Syros, Mahindra Thar and moreauto Next123 Photostories  6 lizards that prove reptiles can be adorableHow to unrot your brain: 5 effective steps to sharpen focus and boost mental clarityFrom Mullum Malarum to Kabali: Rajinikanth’s most emotional movies that fans still cherishLegends reborn – Bollywood actors who came back strongKyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi 2: Smriti Irani, Amar Upadhyay and other stars' educational qualificationGreen, pink and purple — jaw-dropping Northern Lights photos you won’t believe are realFrom Munshi Ranjeet to David John: Bigg Boss Malayalam contestants who faced first-week evictionAdorable baby shower photos of Bigg Boss Telugu fame Soniya'RRR,' 'Kaalapani,' and 'Major': South Indian films that celebrate IndiaNayanthara's classic films to watch123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillJessica RadcliffeLebron JamesBasanti ChatterjeePatrick MahomesGautam AdaniElon MuskIndia Nayara EnergyCJI GavaiBengaluru Student AttackTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteImmigration crackdown: Venezuelan civic groups sue Trump admin over termination of Temporary Protected Status; call it cruelty towards vulnerableFormer Platters band member Sandra Hall goes missing, last seen on Friday in Brooklyn; search under wayUAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed sends firefighting team to aid Albania’s wildfire battleRoad safety improves sharply in Kuwait: Accidents down 45%, deaths down 34% in first half of 2025Kuwait: No more minimum salary requirement for family visit visas, what expats need to knowTurkish Airlines and Oman Air frequent flyer partnership: Travelers can now earn miles across both airlines‘Take our capital back’: Nearly 800 troops deployed by Donald Trump arrive at DC; 23 individuals arrested overnightBahrain stands tall: Ranks 3rd in Arab region in new UN Human Development reportUAE: What is Abu Dhabi's ‘Hayat’ program?

AI image ALGIERS: At a beach near Algiers, brown algae native to the Pacific Ocean cover the golden sand, posing a threat to ecosystems native to the area and their stench repelling swimmers at the peak of summer.Following a recent government call to help clear beaches swarmed by the seaweed species known scientifically as Rugulopteryx okamurae, several volunteers and charities have stepped in."When it washes up, we can't swim," said Salim Hemmedi, a 43-year-old vacationer at a beach in Sidi Fredj, where volunteers raked up heaps of the plant."We hope the situation will improve so that we can enjoy ourselves... and that children can swim in peace."The alga originates from temperate waters around Japan and the Korean peninsula in the northwest Pacific Ocean.It was first spotted in Algeria in late 2023, according to Lamia Bahbah, a lecturer and researcher at the National School of Marine Sciences and Coastal Planning.And lately, some have noted that it has been increasingly washed ashore.Youcef Segni, a marine engineer and biologist, said the algae proliferated at a significantly higher rate than in 2023 and 2024."They invade the habitats of other algae in the seabed, which leads to the disappearance of some species," he said, adding that it can also displace some native fish.Fast reproductionIn France, Spain and Portugal, the Rugulopteryx okamurae species has also been observed.Earlier this year, Spanish football club Real Betis introduced kits repurposed from seaweed to raise awareness about the issue.A 2023 study by the Marine Drugs journal said the alga's invasive character led to "a replacement of the native biota and an occupancy rate that reached almost 100 per cent in some locations" in Portugal.In Algeria, the plant has been spotted in at least three of the country's 14 coastal provinces, including the capital where 16 beaches are affected, authorities said."Are the waters suitable for swimming? Yes," said Environment Minister Nadjiba Djilali during the cleanup campaign, adding there were no records of the plant causing allergies.Researcher Bahbah said stopping its proliferation was "unfortunately impossible at this stage".She said the plant reproduces at a high rate, both sexually and asexually.The species can reproduce through fragmentation, meaning new individual algae can develop from fragmented pieces of other Rugulopteryx okamurae algae.The algae spread mainly by clinging to the hulls of boats, and the Mediterranean's moderate temperature favours the seaweed's fast reproduction."We are going to fight it," said Fella Zaboudj, a state engineer in marine sciences, adding that researchers were monitoring its spread, development and evolution.Zaboudj said research was also underway to determine whether the algae could be repurposed as fertiliser.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksSibu SorenPatna Double Decker BridgeSpiceJetRBI MPC MeetRussia OilUS China TradeNSDL IPO allotmentTop TrendingTrinity RodmanDe'Aaron FoxConnor BedardDennis RodmanRussell WilsonMitch MarnersKirby DachMatthew TkachukConnor McDavidAdam RuzickaTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website'Will raise tariff substantially in 24 hours': Donald Trump fires fresh salvo;

Ireland's wind energy sector has long been touted as full of potential. AI image BANGOR: On Ireland's blustery western seaboard, researchers are gleefully flying giant kites, not for fun but in the hope of generating renewable electricity and sparking a "revolution" in wind energy."We use a kite to capture the wind and a generator at the bottom of it that captures the power," Padraic Doherty of Kitepower, the Dutch firm behind the venture, told AFP. At its test site in operation since September 2023 near the small town of Bangor Erris, the team transports the vast 60-square-metre (645,000-square-feet) kite from a hangar across the lunar-like bogland to a generator. The kite is then attached by a cable tether to the machine and acts like a "yo-yo or fishing reel", Doherty said."It gets cast out and flies up, the tether pulls it back in, over and over again, creating energy," he said, testing the kite's ropes and pulleys before a flight.The sparsely populated spot near the stormy Atlantic coast is the world's first designated airborne renewable energy test site. And although the idea is still small in scale, it could yet prove to be a mighty plan as Ireland seeks to cut its reliance on fossil fuels such as oil and gas."We are witnessing a revolution in wind energy," said Andrei Luca, operations head at Kitepower, a zero-emissions energy solutions spin-off from the Delft University of Technology."It took nearly 25 years for wind turbines to evolve from 30-kilowatt prototypes to megawatt scale, and decades to offshore wind farms we see today," he added.The system flies autonomously, driven by software developed at the university in the Netherlands, but Doherty acts as the kite's "pilot" on the ground, monitoring its flight path for efficiency. The kite flies up around 400 metres (1,300 feet) and reels in to about 190 metres, generating around 30 kilowatts for storage.The force spins "like a dynamo on a bike", Doherty said, adding that "it generates up to two and a half tonnes of force through each turn".The electricity is stored in batteries, similar to solar photovoltaic systems, with the kite currently able to fully charge a 336-kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery."That's a meaningful amount of energy, sufficient for powering a remote outpost, a small island, polar station, or even a construction site," Luca said."Add additional kites and we can power a bigger island."'Mobile, flexible'According to Doherty, a chief advantage of the kite system is its flexibility and swift start-up capability."We can set up in 24 hours and can bring it anywhere, it's super mobile, and doesn't need expensive, time- and energy-consuming turbine foundations to be built," he said. A kite system is "way less invasive on the landscape (than wind turbines), produces clean energy and doesn't need a supply chain of fuel to keep running", Luca added.During January's Storm Eowyn, which caused widespread and long-lasting power outages in Ireland, the system showed its value in Bangor Erris, according to Luca. "Paired with a battery, it provided uninterrupted electricity before, during and after the storm," he said. Ireland's wind energy sector has long been touted as full of potential.But progress on large-scale delivery of onshore and offshore turbines has been held up by planning delays and electricity grid capacity constraints.The Irish government has set ambitious targets for offshore wind energy to deliver 20 gigawatts of energy by 2040 and at least 37 gigawatts by 2050.In 2024, Irish wind farms provided around a third of the country's electricity according to Wind Energy Ireland (WEI), a lobby group for the sector. This compares to the UK, where, according to trade association RenewableUK, wind energy from the country's combined wind farms first reached 20 gigawatts in November 2022.The ability of airborne wind energy (AWE) systems to harness high-altitude winds with relatively low infrastructure requirements "makes them particularly suitable for remote, offshore or mobile applications," Mahdi Salari, an AWE researcher at University College Cork, told AFP.But he said Kitepower would face challenges on "regulation, safety, and system reliability". Such technology however could plug gaps in places where "land availability, costs or logistical constraints hinder the deployment of traditional wind turbines", Salari said.By the 2030s, he said: "I expect AWE to contribute meaningfully to diversified, flexible and distributed renewable energy networks".Discover stories of India’s leading eco-innovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksSibu SorenPatna Double Decker BridgeSpiceJetGold Price PredectionRussia OilUS China TradeNSDL IPO allotmentTop TrendingRussell WilsonHailee SteinfeldsF1 StandingsDez BryantLebron James WifeRussia Oil ImportsTriple HPrince HarryRJ MahvashAntonio BrownTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteBrooke Hogan’s husband: Hulk Hogan showed no interest in meeting grandkidsDak Prescott builds new mansion, reveals why he razed the last oneTaylor Swift’s Kelce jacket inspires Kristin Juszczyk’s new NFL lineGabrielle Union on menopause: 'It makes it hard' — motherhood now more emotional, exhaustingGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai to employees: ‘I think we have to....'Apple CEO Tim Cook confirms: Majority of new iPhones sold in the US are 'made' in India;

The zoo assures that donated animals like rabbits and guinea pigs will be humanely euthanized before being used as food.

This initiative aims to mimic the natural food chain, promoting animal welfare and natural behaviour among captive carnivores. (Ai generated image)  If you have a pet you can no longer keep, one zoo in Denmark is offering an unusual option.Aalborg Zoo is asking the public to donate small pets — not for rehoming, but to be used as food for its captive predators.Aalborg Zoo, located in northern Denmark, said in a Facebook post that the move is meant to mimic the natural food chain of animals housed there. The zoo says this effort supports “animal welfare and professional integrity,” and assures that any donated pets will be “gently euthanized” by trained staff.“If you have a healthy animal that needs to be given away for various reasons, feel free to donate it to us,” the post said.The zoo lists rabbits, guinea pigs, horses and chickens as examples of suitable donations.PollWhat do you think about Aalborg Zoo's practice of accepting pets for food for predators?Support it for animal welfareOppose it, find other solutionsOnce euthanised, the animals will be used as fodder for the zoo’s carnivores.“That way, nothing goes to waste — and we ensure natural behaviour, nutrition and well-being of our predators,” the zoo claimed.The post is accompanied by a picture of a wildcat showing its teeth with its mouth wide open. It also includes a link to the zoo’s website.About the zoo Aalborg Zoo was founded in April 1935. The facility is located near the centre of Aalborg and spans 8 hectares. It houses more than 1,500 animals across 126 species and draws hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.According to the zoo’s official website, Aalborg Zoo focuses on conservation, sustainability and education.It takes part in international breeding programmes for endangered species and supports global efforts in animal conservation, research and fair trade. It was also the first zoo in Denmark to receive an environment certificate and is known for its work in protecting nature and the environment.The zoo maintains that the practice of using donated pets as prey aligns with its mission to support natural behaviours in captive predators.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

LISBON: Portugal's government on Saturday issued an alert warning of a heatwave with a high risk of fires in large parts of the country in the coming days.The alert, covering Sunday to Thursday, included a ban on bonfires, fireworks and the use of electrical equipment in forests.The authorities also restricted access to some woodland areas, announced a boost in staffing for the forest ranger service and increased land and air patrols in high fire-risk areas."The next week will be difficult" said Home Affairs Minister Maria Lucia Amaral.Both Portugal and neighbouring Spain have had to battle wildfires in the recent days, a problem they and other countries face every year.Experts say climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of droughts and fires around the world.Following the deadly fire season in 2017, Portugal ramped up its spending on wildfire prevention and response. More than 29,000 hectares (71,600 acres) have already been destroyed by fire since the beginning of the year, according to Portugal's Institute of Forests (ICNF).End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous'Kingom' actor Vijay Deverakonda’s stylish looksEntertainmentVijay Deverakonda’s fitness workout routineEntertainmentTop 10 colour-changing birds of IndiaLifestyleRaksha Bandhan-worthy mehendi designs to try this yearLifestyle10 things to know before getting an Arowana fish for good luckLifestyleMouni Roy’s top 10 gorgeous ethnic lookstvPriya Prakash Varrier serves fierce fashionEntertainmentSouth Actresses dazzle in this week's best photosEntertainmentMost popular baby names of 2024Lifestyle9 Ayurvedic habits to regulate the nervous systemLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Bigg Boss Malayalam 7 contestants Adhila and Noora: All about the lesbian couple who fought a legal battle for loveWhen fame faded Mahima Chaudhry chose to fight not fall5 snake parks in India that are absolutely fang-tastic and what makes them special5 things to know before drinking water in a copper bottleBigg Boss Malayalam 7 contestant Rena Fathima: Who is this 19-year-old influencer?From ‘DDLJ’ to ‘Saiyaara’: 5 Bollywood love stories that gave us hopeful, happy endingsHollywood's 7 BFFs whose friendship stood the test of timeThe Great Indian Kapil Show: From a luxurious house in Madh Island worth approximately Rs 12 crore to net worth, car collection; Archana Puran Singh’s lavish life'Coolie' audio launch highlights: Star-studded speeches, roaring cheers & a grand tribute to Rajinikanth—everything you should not missFrom Thummanpeta to Stardom:Meet the family behind Vijay Deverakonda’s stardom123Hot PicksKamala HarrisIndian NavyJ&K landslideTrump TariffsUPI New RulesGST collectionsJulia HymanTop TrendingWWE Summerslam HighlightsHailee SteinfeldsTop Richest Billionaries in the worldEarthquake VideoLebron James WifeRJ MahvashGerman Influencer BengaluruKannada signboard ruleNayara EnergyIndia US Crude OilTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteHailee Steinfeld's latest workout photos break the internetGabrielle Union on menopause: 'It makes it hard' — motherhood now more emotional, exhaustingIND vs ENG Live: India need eight wickets to level the series 2-2Who is Matt Deitke?

Video/PTI NEW DELHI: Continuous heavy rainfall on Saturday brought large parts of Bihar’s capital Patna to a standstill, causing severe waterlogging and traffic congestion. Visuals from Kurji Road and other low-lying areas showed flooded streets, traffic jams, and pedestrians struggling to navigate waterlogged roads.Kerala Hit by Earliest Monsoon Since 2009 | IMD Predicts Above-Normal Rainfall for 2025The flood-like situation disrupted normal life and exposed administrative lapses in monsoon preparedness. Despite repeated assurances by civic authorities about improved drainage systems and better planning, the city appeared unprepared once again.Commuters faced long traffic jams in various parts of the city, as vehicles were stuck or slowed down due to waterlogging. Pedestrians were seen wading through flooded roads with extreme caution, fearing open manholes, uncovered drains, and the threat of electric shocks from submerged wires and poles.PollWhat do you think is the biggest issue causing urban flooding during monsoon?Poor drainage systemsLack of planning and maintenanceMeanwhile, the India Meteorological Department has predicted heavy rainfall in the region over the next few days.Moreover, contaminated water triggered a diarrhea outbreak in Bihar's Jehanabad.

House razings to save Niger capital's forest shield dismay locals
Hamissou Issiakou grumbled as he worked to strip bare his house, marked for demolition for illegally encroaching on the tip of green forest that's keeping the expanding desert at bay from Niger's capital. Director General of Water and Forests within the environment ministry Yacouba Seybou said on state television that since 2004 "decrees have prohibited housing in the (green) belt".

Director General of Water and Forests within the environment ministry Yacouba Seybou said on state television that since 2004 "decrees have prohibited housing in the (green) belt". Representative image (AFP) NIAMEY: Hamissou Issiakou grumbled as he worked to strip bare his house, marked for demolition for illegally encroaching on the tip of green forest that's keeping the expanding desert at bay from Niger's capital.His is one of nearly 500 homes being bulldozed as the authorities in the arid desert country, which is particularly at risk from man-made global warming, seek to shore up the wooded belt around Niamey's outskirts.Ukraine Launches MASSIVE Drone Attack On Russia; 3 Killed, Over 100 UAVs Shot Down"We've bought our plots of land at great expense. In the end it's a big waste," Issiakou told AFP, after urging workers to hurry up and remove an enormous gate before the police arrive. Since the heavy machinery began rolling in at the end of June, dozens of slums, luxury houses and apartment blocks have tumbled like a house of cards.Some homeowners have just stood by and watched in dismay as the bulldozers tore down their houses. Others, like Issiakou, have rushed to remove anything of value before the two-week notice period was up, from windows, metal sheets and electrical cables to small drinking water tanks and surveillance cameras.All say they bought their land from private real-estate agencies. - 'Submit to Allah' -In a country with one of the highest population growth rates in the world, the number of residents in Niamey has doubled since 2005, from 750,000 to one-and-a-half million, according to the national statistics institute. Thanks to that rapid urbanisation, the forest belt has lost more than half its area since it was completed in 1993 and now measures just 25 kilometres (16 miles) long and a kilometre wide. Hailing from various social classes, the woods' soon-to-be-gone inhabitants were originally attracted to the capital's outskirts by the good quality of life and reasonable cost of a plot. The distance from the bureaucracy within Niamey proper, which can often delay construction projects by years, did not hurt either. Thermos in hand, Aboul-Razak Moussa handed out coffee to the workmen using crowbars to dig up the cobblestones in the courtyard of his brand-new building."I bought the land for 12 million CFA francs ($21,000) and invested 127 million CFA francs (more than $220,000) to build my building," the owner of a welding company lamented."We submit ourselves to Allah." Businessman Ali Hamza was indignant."We're in the peak of the rainy season, it's inhuman," the father-of-10 argued. So far, at least 4,000 people have been evicted and nearly 500 homes, mostly slums, demolished, authorities say.- Rising temperatures -Carparks, petrol stations, pharmacies, shops, rubbish dumps and health centres sprung up to cater for those who made their home in the forested area.The project to introduce a green belt around Niamey is not part of the African Union's flagship Great Green Wall initiative, but its aims are the same.Landlocked Niger lies in the heart of the Sahel, a semiarid region stretching from Senegal to Sudan where temperatures are rising 1.5 times faster than the global average.At the same time, Niger suffers periods of drought and severe flooding.It is "imperative" that Niger "preserves more green spaces", Sani Ayouba, head of the Young Volunteers for the Environment NGO said.Director General of Water and Forests within the environment ministry Yacouba Seybou said on state television that since 2004 "decrees have prohibited housing in the (green) belt".Under the law, offenders face three months to two years in prison.Former ministers have "authorised private housing developments", Boubacar Maman, an official at the urban planning ministry, said.The environment ministry says a zoo and aquatic park as well as a botanic garden, sports and leisure area will soon be created within the forested green belt.bh/bam/bdi/sbk-kjm/yadEnd of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousTransform your boring sandals with trendy DIY embellishmentsLifestyleBhagyashri Borse's style statementsEntertainmentFrom Pulitzer to Orange: 10 prestigious awards given for LiteratureLifestyle10 veggies that can grow in containers in balconyLifestyle'Kingom' actor Vijay Deverakonda’s stylish looksEntertainmentVijay Deverakonda’s fitness workout routineEntertainmentTop 10 colour-changing birds of IndiaLifestyleRaksha Bandhan-worthy mehendi designs to try this yearLifestyle10 things to know before getting an Arowana fish for good luckLifestyleMouni Roy’s top 10 gorgeous ethnic lookstv Next123 Photostories  Top 6 zoos to visit across India for a complete wildlife experience10 minute daily habits that are perfect brain exercisesBigg Boss Malayalam 7 Contestant Aryan Kathuria: All about the handsome actor featured in a Poonam Pandey show6 healthy smart foods for babies when their teeth hurtFrom white themed rooms to aesthetic details: Debinna Bonnerjee’s living and bedroom give peaceful vibesHow to spend 5 days in Madhya Pradesh: The perfect Orchha–Khajuraho itineraryRisk of type 1 diabetes may depend on where childhood is spentBigg Boss Malayalam 7 contestant Abhisree: All about the actor-dancer with an inspiring journey5 filling foods under 50 calories7 key boundaries mentally strong people set to thrive at work123Hot PicksKamala HarrisIndian NavyJ&K landslideTrump TariffsUPI New RulesGST collectionsJulia HymanTop TrendingWWE Summerslam HighlightsHailee SteinfeldsTop Richest Billionaries in the worldEarthquake VideoLebron James WifeRJ MahvashGerman Influencer BengaluruKannada signboard ruleNayara EnergyIndia US Crude OilTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire Website'Disgraceful': Ex-South Korea president Yoon Suk Yeol resists questioning by laying down in underwear;

Southeastern Turkey is reeling under a record-breaking heatwave, with temperatures exceeding 50C in Silopi. Residents are struggling with soaring electricity bills due to constant air conditioning use and are appealing for state support. Deforestation and policy changes allowing mining on agricultural lands exacerbate the heat, intensifying the challenges faced by locals who depend on air conditioning as a necessity.

Residents are struggling with soaring electricity bills due to constant air conditioning use and are appealing for state support. Deforestation and policy changes allowing mining on agricultural lands exacerbate the heat, intensifying the challenges faced by locals who depend on air conditioning as a necessity. Representative Image  A choking heatwave left astonished locals in southeastern Turkey calling for state help to pay their air conditioning bills after the temperature surged past 50 degree celsius."We cannot cope with the heat," ice-cream maker Recep Esiyok, 59, told AFP in Silopi, where meteorologists measured 50.5C on Friday -- a national record."I've been living in Silopi for about 30 years. I've never seen such heat... I've never seen such heat anywhere."He is getting through the heatwave thanks to the air conditioner in his shop, but is now worried about paying for the electricity."My bill last month was 59,000 lira (1,450 dollars). We are asking for state support on this issue."'Incomparable' heat: Before Friday's record, the previous peak in Turkey had been 49.5 degree celsius in August 2023.Scientists agree that climate change caused by humans burning fossil fuels is increasing the likelihood, length and intensity of heatwaves."The heat has reached a point where it's incomparable to previous years," said Halil Coskun, 52, a local reporter.The country is still in the grip of the heatwave and since Sunday temperatures overall have surged from six to 12 degrees above seasonal norms, according to the state meteorology directorate.Wildfire threat: Turkey has fought fires in several regions since the start of the summer. Last week, 10 people perished while fighting a fire in Eskisehir province.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday the country has experienced drier conditions than normal over the past five years as a result of global warming."Extreme heat, low humidity, and strong winds are unfortunately increasing the risk of fire," he said.He said the state was using drones to monitor and protect forests.The streets were relatively empty and the atmosphere tense in Silopi, a Kurdish city whose main income is trade with Iraq across the border 10 kilometres (six miles) away."When it's hot, there's no one outside during the day," said Esiyok.Deforestation complaints: Other locals complained at the lack of vegetation to provide relief around the town, which lies at the foot of a mountain."Unfortunately, the forests here were burned in the past for security reasons," said Coskun.He said the Turkish army cleared them in the search for fighters from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a rebel group that recently disarmed.Turkey's parliament this month also passed a bill that opens certain agricultural lands including olive groves to mining activities, despite widespread opposition."We could at least minimise the heat by planting trees, not by felling them," Coskun said.Electricity bills: Sweating in his kebab shop, another local, Cemil Seher, said that summers in Silopi last not three months, but five.For Seher, 51, air conditioning is no longer a luxury but a necessity."AC is essential here as much as bread and water," he said."When the air conditioners are running, the electricity bills are very high," he said, demanding authorities offer discounts for businesses."I want a discount not only for Silopi but for the entire region from here to Sanliurfa" in the east, he said."I am not making a profit because I've been working... to pay my electricity bill."Discover stories of India’s leading eco-innovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksKamala HarrisBogota AirportUS Oil ReserveTrump TariffsUPI New RulesStarlink SatelliteJulia HymanTop TrendingTravis KelceTom BradyBengaluru Boy Kidnap MurderCBSE Class 10th Sample PapersHow new nep rule worksYuzvendra Chahal DatingStephen CurryJoe BurrowBlake LivelyTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website40 jobs AI can't touch in 2025, says Microsoft Research: Is your career on the list?Former PM HD Devegowda's grandson Prajwal Revanna convicted for raping 47-year-old domestic helpIND vs ENG Live: Rain likely to play spoilsport as India eye 300; Woakes ruled outUPI new rules 2025: New NPCI changes kick in from August 1 - All you need to knowSSC exam 2025 glitches spark massive nationwide protest: Here’s why #SSCMisManagement is trending on social mediaCAT 2025 registration begins at iimcat.ac.in: Check direct link to apply online hereAP Police Constable final result 2025 released at slprb.ap.gov.in; check direct link hereIs Yuzvendra Chahal dating RJ Mahvash?

Chinese sub discovers deepest-ever creatures 10 km undersea
A Chinese submersible has discovered thousands of worms and molluscs nearly 10 kilometres (six miles) below sea level in the Mariana Trench, the deepest colony of creatures ever observed, a study revealed on Wednesday. Last year, the Chinese submersible "Fendouzhe" -- or "Striver" -- dove 23 times into the depths of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean with researchers on board, according to the study in the journal Nature.

Last year, the Chinese submersible "Fendouzhe" -- or "Striver" -- dove 23 times into the depths of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean with researchers on board, according to the study in the journal Nature. AP file photo PARIS: A Chinese submersible has discovered thousands of worms and molluscs nearly 10 kilometres (six miles) below sea level in the Mariana Trench, the deepest colony of creatures ever observed, a study revealed on Wednesday.The discovery in Earth's deepest underwater valley suggests that there could be much more life thriving in the hostile conditions at the bottom of our planet's largely unexplored oceans than previously thought, the China-led team of scientists said.Almost all life on Earth is supported by light from the Sun. However, in the total darkness at the bottom of the world, these creatures live off of chemicals such as methane seeping through cracks in the seafloor, a process called chemosynthesis.Last year, the Chinese submersible "Fendouzhe", or "Striver", dove 23 times into the depths of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean with researchers on board, according to the study in the journal Nature.They found colonies of thousands of marine tubeworms and molluscs called bivalves at depths ranging from 2,500 to 9,533 metres (8,200 to 31,000 feet) deep. Video released alongside the study showed fields of tubeworms, which grew up to 30 centimetres (12 inches) long, as well as piles of molluscs and clams. Spiky crustaceans, free-floating marine worms, sea cucumbers, feathery-armed sea lilies and other invertebrates were also recorded in the depths.The study marked "the discovery of the deepest and the most extensive chemosynthesis-based communities known to exist on Earth," its authors said.Given that other ocean trenches are similar, "such chemosynthesis-based communities might be more widespread than previously anticipated," they added.The researchers said they also found "compelling evidence" that methane was being produced by microbes, with the tubeworms tending to cluster around microbial mats that resemble snow. Previous studies have found thriving communities of single-cell organisms on the ocean floor, but few large animals.But a remotely operated vehicle discovered tubeworms and other marine invertebrates living in hydrothermal vents in the crust below the seafloor two kilometres deep in the Pacific, research said last year.Pressure rising The new study was published as nations wrangle over the contentious issue of deep-sea mining. China, the United States and others have expressed interest in mining the depths for valuable minerals.Ocean scientists warn that mining the little-explored seafloor, one of the last wild zones on the planet, could decimate fragile ecosystems that are not yet well understood.Despite recent talks, the International Seabed Authority -- which oversees deep-sea mining in international waters -- has yet to adopt long-awaited rules governing the industry. Chinese media has previously reported that the Fendouzhe submersible mission will conduct research on "deep-sea materials".Only a handful of people have ever visited the bottom of the Mariana Trench, which is a crescent-shaped depression in the Earth's crust that is deeper than Mount Everest is high.The first explorers visited the trench in 1960 on a brief expedition.But after that, there were no missions until Hollywood director James Cameron made the first solo trip to the bottom in 2012, describing a "desolate" and "alien" environment.The water pressure at the bottom of the trench is a crushing eight tons per square inch, more than a thousand times the atmospheric pressure at sea level.Discover stories of India’s leading eco-innovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksKamala HarrisBogota AirportUS Oil ReserveTrump TariffsUPI New RulesStarlink SatelliteJulia HymanTop TrendingTravis KelceTom BradyBengaluru Boy Kidnap MurderCBSE Class 10th Sample PapersHow new nep rule worksYuzvendra Chahal DatingStephen CurryJoe BurrowBlake LivelyTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteSSC exam 2025 glitches spark massive nationwide protest: Here’s why #SSCMisManagement is trending on social mediaCAT 2025 registration begins at iimcat.ac.in: Check direct link to apply online hereAP Police Constable final result 2025 released at slprb.ap.gov.in; check direct link hereIs Yuzvendra Chahal dating RJ Mahvash?

Canada project reclaims 'foul' industrial area to contain floods

An aerial view of the Don River in the newly unveiled Biidaasige Park, part of Toronto's Port Lands Flood Protection Project, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (AFP photo) TORONTO: The spur to build Toronto's billion-dollar-plus flood prevention project dates back to a devastating hurricane in 1954, but planners say its urgency was reinforced by the recent tragic flooding in Texas.The Port Lands project has, in part, reversed a consequence of industrialization by reconnecting Lake Ontario with the Don River, more than a century after they were severed to create an industrial area.Chris Glaisek, chief planning officer at the municipal body Waterfront Toronto, said the idea was to "heal the land from the way it was repurposed 100 years ago," with a focus on "flood protection and naturalization."The complex project -- one of the largest in Toronto's history with a cost of Can$1.4 billion (US$1 billion) -- included digging a river valley and the creation of two new river outlets, with wetlands and marshes to absorb excess water during extreme storms.The mouth of the Don River was once the Great Lakes system's largest fresh water marsh, a rich habitat and vital food resource for Indigenous people before colonization.But Toronto, like many North American cities, saw industrial growth in the late 19th Century.Much of the marsh was drained and filled in to make room for a port industrial area, while the river was re-routed into a man-made channel. The Port Lands never thrived as an industrial area, leaving a vast stretch of eastern downtown under-used, and the Don River became polluted. "It was really dirty, it was foul, it was terrible," Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow said recently. - Hurricane Hazel -On October 15, 1954 Hurricane Hazel hit Toronto, after hammering parts of the Caribbean and eastern United States.It killed 81 people across the Greater Toronto Area and served as catalyst for the city to get serious about flood protection. Hazel flooded the Humber River, in western Toronto, but Glaisek said "it was understood at the time that that same amount of rainfall, had it landed on the (eastern) Don, would have done a comparable amount of damage." He called Hazel an initial "impetus" to re-naturalize the Port Lands, but rising awareness over the past two decades about the causal link between climate change and extreme floods helped advance the project. - 'Duty bound' -To reclaim the Port Lands, Toronto partnered with the US-based landscape architecture firm Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, which has worked on the Brooklyn Bridge Park and the Obama Presidential Center in Chicago.Laura Solano, the lead designer, said the project was "duty bound to address catastrophic flooding," but stressed it offered "much more."Because the area has been reformed to cope with flood waters, parts have been declared safe for new housing -- an urgent need in the expensive metropolis.There is also a new park, trails and people can canoe or kayak through the rehabilitated Don.Solano stressed Toronto's initial decision to alter the area was consistent with the times, when North American cities moved to "industrialize their waters...to raise their economic position."But now, "every city is looking to reclaim their waters," she told AFP. The Port Lands "shows the world that it's possible to fix the past and turn deficit and remnant industrial lands into living and breathing infrastructure."- 'The river is going to flood' -As Glaisek described the project, he stood on a bank that would, by design, be under water during a major storm."It's all planned so that it can flood, the water level can rise, the river can get about three, maybe four times wider than it is now, absorb all of that volume of water," he said. "When the storm event subsides, it will shrink back down to this."It's a planning approach that recognizes "we're seeing more and more of these events.""Like in Texas, you see very tragic outcomes when you haven't really tried to plan for nature," he told AFP, referring to flash floods in early July that killed at least 135 people. He urged planners to "reposition" their relationship to nature and ditch the mindset that "humans (can) control everything.""Let's acknowledge the river is going to flood.

Kanchan trees, nature-based solution to riverbank erosion in Majuli (Image: ANI) MAJULI: In the village of Pathorichuk, Majuli, Assam, local residents have discovered a remarkable way to combat riverbank erosion by planting Kanchan trees along the Brahmaputra River. This sustainable and eco-friendly approach has proven to be a natural shield against the relentless forces of erosion.Each year, the mighty Brahmaputra, along with its tributaries Subansiri and Kherkatia, relentlessly eats away at Majuli's landmass, threatening its very existence. Traditional anti-erosion measures such as RCC porcupines and geo-bags have only offered temporary relief and have largely failed to provide long-term protection.However, the residents of Pathorichuk have discovered a sustainable and local solution. By planting large numbers of Kanchan trees along the riverbanks, the village has managed to significantly reduce the impact of erosion in the area. The deep-rooted trees not only hold the soil together but also act as a natural barrier against the strong river currents.The success of Pathorichuk village presents a compelling case for the broader adoption of ecological methods to combat erosion. Locals now urge the government, administrative bodies, and concerned departments to consider the large-scale plantation of Kanchan trees across erosion-prone areas of Majuli.If replicated effectively, this eco-friendly and cost-effective model could play a key role in safeguarding Majuli, the world's largest river island, from further disappearance. While speaking to ANI, Nirab Tai, a local from Pathorichuk village, said, "We used to face heavy erosion in the past, and our village was constantly under threat. Around 20 years ago, our elders planted these trees to prevent erosion. Since then, the erosion has completely stopped, and our village is now safe. These trees are like blessings to us, they protect us. We call them "Kanchan trees" in Assamese.""I believe that if Kanchan trees are planted along the banks of the Brahmaputra River, there will be no erosion, and all the villages near the river will be protected. These trees grow very rapidly. You don't have to do much, just plant a branch of the Kanchan tree, and it will grow, especially quickly during the monsoon season. From a single tree, many more Kanchan trees will grow.The RCC porcupines used by the government to control erosion often get submerged during the monsoon season. But these trees are doing a tremendous job. They not only protect the land but also provide a healthy environment, shade, and natural beauty." Another local, Krishna Payeng, told ANI, "These trees grow from branches. When planted near rivers, they gradually grow massively and help control soil erosion. The government should consider this seriously. Along with geo bags, if we plant Kanchan trees, erosion can be effectively controlled."He suggested distributing these trees among students and highlighting their benefits on World Environment Day."These trees should be distributed among students, and they should be informed about their benefits. On World Environment Day, the positive impact of these trees should be highlighted. I sincerely request the government to look into this matter and plant Kanchan trees in areas highly affected by erosion, not only in our country, but across the world."The success of Pathorichuk village's initiative presents a compelling case for adopting ecological methods to combat erosion. By embracing nature-based solutions, we can protect the world's largest river island, Majuli, from further disappearance.

Mehar’s custom-engineered drone reached this remarkable milestone in an astonishing 0.91 seconds, a feat that not only demonstrates his technical prowess but also sets a new benchmark in the rapidly evolving world of drone technology.Mehar’s journey to this achievement has been anything but straightforward. His fascination with drones began in 8th grade, and this passion has only deepened over the years. With a keen interest in pushing technological boundaries, Mehar embarked on a months-long project to build a drone capable of unparalleled vertical acceleration.“I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of pushing the limits of what drones can do,” Mehar explained. “But breaking a world record wasn’t just about the end result; it was about the process. I wanted to prove that current technology could achieve something extraordinary, but the path to get there was filled with challenges.”The project required Mehar to design, test, and refine multiple drone prototypes. “There were moments when I felt like I was chasing an impossible dream,” Mehar recalled. “I went through countless designs, and many of them failed during testing. Some drones crashed so badly that I had no choice but to go back to the drawing board and start from scratch. Each crash was a setback, but it also sparked new ideas and innovations.”Undeterred by the setbacks, Mehar poured his energy into creating a drone that was not only fast but also aerodynamically optimized. “I spent countless hours on CAD software, meticulously designing and tweaking each component. The goal was to make the drone as streamlined as possible, which led me to shape it like a rocket. This design wasn’t just about aesthetics; it was about reducing drag and maximizing speed.”Mehar’s dedication to his craft paid off in spectacular fashion. “Every failure taught me something valuable,” he said. “It forced me to think creatively and to consider every detail, from the materials used to the weight distribution of the drone. The process was grueling, but it was also incredibly rewarding to see my ideas take flight—literally.”This record-breaking achievement is more than just a personal triumph for Mehar; it has significant implications for the future of drone technology. “The possibilities are endless,” Mehar mused. “High-speed vertical acceleration could revolutionize everything from emergency response to space exploration. This isn’t just about setting a record; it’s about opening doors to new innovations and applications.”Mehar’s groundbreaking work has already begun to inspire others in the drone community and beyond. “I hope this accomplishment encourages other young innovators to push their own boundaries,” he said. “Technology is advancing rapidly, and there’s so much potential waiting to be unlocked. I’m excited to see where we can go from here.”As Mehar looks ahead, the sky is truly the limit.

The formats mentioned above are most prominently used globally. JPGs can be different things like signatures required to sign documents or screenshots of an instruction manual. When converting JPG to PDF and then sharing it, you want to maintain the quality of the image. It also becomes highly convenient for the end-user to access the PDF file.There are a plethora of tools to convert JPG to PDF. Nonetheless, a tool that has gained a lot of trust in the segment is Adobe Acrobat. It simply converts any file from JPG to PDF without altering the quality. Moving ahead, we will step by step explain how you can use Adobe Acrobat to convert an image to PDF.Basic Definition of JPG and PDFJPG or JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, and it is mostly used for compressing highly detailed images, making them smaller for increasing their shareability.

Another highlight is that it also maintains the quality of images when the size (dimensions) is increased.Why should you convert JPG to PDF? Regarding size, JPG files take less space than PDFs. However, PDF files are easily manageable, and you can also use the other services in Adobe Document Cloud to make sharing, uploading, and managing super easy. PDF will have the upper hand over JPG because the former is easily editable. Any JPG converted to PDF can be divided into different components for editing.

Choose a plan - You can also opt for the free plan if you prefer. Apart from that, the subscription can be purchased at minimal prices. Tap on the plus button and the right bottom of the screen and then tap on the open file. Give the application storage access to get your files for editing. Select the file you want to convert. Now, you will see the 'Convert PDF' button under the image; tap on it. Your image will be successfully converted to PDF. Note: On the smartphone version, you cannot use the Image to PDF convert feature for free.Frequently asked questionsCan you convert JPG to PDF for free?Yes, there are multiple online and offline tools that can be used to convert any image to PDF without spending a single dime.How to convert JPG into editable PDF?There are not many tools available in the market that offer accurate PDF editing features such as Adobe Acrobat.

Doordarshan will telecast live the Mangala, Shringaar, Rajbhog, Sandhya, and Shayan Aartis offered to the Ram Lalla idol at the Ayodhya Ram temple on DD National, connecting devotees who can't visit the temple. National broadcaster Doordarshan has good news for Lord Ram Devotees. Doordarshan has announced that it will telecast live the morning prayers offered to the Ram Lalla idol at the Ram Temple in Ayodhya every day.Doordarshan has shared the same in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Doordarshan said that the morning aarti offered to Ram Lalla will be telecast live on DD National every morning from 6:30 am.The national broadcaster said that the decision to telecast the morning aarti live every day was taken with the aim of connecting devotees of Lord Ram, especially after the temple was inaugurated less than two months ago in a grand ceremony and everyone can't visit the temple in person. The Aarti will be telecast simultaneously on DD’s YouTube channel also.Secondly, the decision was taken because the Trust doesn’t have logistical arrangements as of now for a live broadcast. Therefore, DD will be posting a two-three-member crew on the temple premises for the coverage of the daily ritual.DD's announcement to telecast the Aarti live for 30 minutes every morning comes after getting the go-ahead from the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust for the same. Initially, DD will air the “Mangala aarti” for a few months, and then, the Ram Temple Trust will take a call on how to take it forward.6 Aartis daily at the Ayodhya Ram templeThere are 6 aartis of Ram Lalla held daily in Ayodhya Ram temple. These include Mangala Aarti at 4:30 am, Shringaar Aarti at 6:30 am, Rajbhog Aarti at 12 noon, Utthapan Aarti at 2 pm, Sandhya Aarti at 7 pm, and Shayan Aarti at 10 pm.Giving directions to devotees for Aarti, the temple trust said, "Entry for Mangala Aarti at 4 AM, Shringar Aarti at 6:15 AM, and Shayan Aarti at 10 PM is possible only with an entry pass. No entry passes required for other Aartis."Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust advisory to devoteesIn an advisory to devotees coming for darshan at the temple, the Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra said, "Devotees can enter the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir for Darshan from 6:30 AM to 9:30 PM. The entire process from entry to exit after Darshan at the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir is extremely simple and convenient. Typically, devotees can have a smooth Darshan of Prabhu Shri Ram Lalla Sarkar within 60 to 75 minutes."The temple trust advised devotees to leave their mobile phones, footwear, purses and other personal items outside the Mandir premises for their convenience and to save time.It has also asked devotees not to bring flowers, garlands, Prasad to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

The design aims to eliminate the hinge crease and reduce the device's thickness while offering added benefits and durability. However, its practicality remains uncertain. Microsoft discontinues Surface Duo smartphones but files a patent for a new foldable device with a single hinge system called 'spine cover plate'. The design aims to eliminate the hinge crease and reduce the device's thickness while offering added benefits and durability. However, its practicality remains uncertain. Microsoft did not get the success it was anticipating with its Android-powered Surface Duo-series smartphones. The company has discontinued the lineup after the Duo 2. But, this does not mean the company has stopped trying. A new patent application filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29, reveals that the company is working on another foldable or dual-display mobile device.The patent application describes the company’s take on the foldable smartphone concept with single hinge technology called “spine cover plate”.Next Microsoft smartphones could feature a Galaxy Z Fold-like designAccording to the patent application, the phone could feature a “flexible display” in a bookstyle design similar to Galaxy Z Fold decies. However, the entire focus is on the spine cover plate mechanism which is aimed at protecting the single-hinge system of the device by covering the structural element. The differentiating factor between the regular hinge and Microsoft’s design is that the spine cover adjusts automatically during the opening and closing of the phone to prevent any unnecessary gaps around the hinge to protect it from dust as well as water. Currently, Samsung’s design offers an IPX8 rating which makes their foldables water-resistant only.The patent further mentions that the new hinge mechanism could allow Microsoft to eliminate the hinge crease less visible than the current options available in the market. Moreover, Microsoft has also mentioned techniques that could allow them to reduce the overall thickness of the foldable smartphone by allowing the spine cover plate to move closer to the device’s hinge when folded. “By retracting the spine cover plate toward the central spine as the first display-supporting frame and the second display-supporting frame are rotated into a face-to-face orientation, the width of the folded computing device is reduced, thereby enabling easier and more comfortable handling of the device, such as with one hand,” Microsoft noted in the patent.Interesting idea, but practicality is a question markThe entire smartphone market is searching for a way to eliminate the foldable crease from their smartphones. Some brands have already implemented the water-drop folding mechanism to reduce it, but there’s nothing like a crease-free foldable out there. Apart from that, the durability quotient of foldable is also important considering all the movable parts these phones have. That said, adding another layer or a movable part on top of the entire foldable mechanism does not appear like a wise move despite the added benefits and durability Microsoft has explained in the patent application.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Initiatives include partnering with the Election Commission, prioritizing trusted content on YouTube, and implementing advertising policies for transparency. Measures against AI-generated content are also taken. Google has announced a series of initiatives aimed at supporting the democratic process and safeguarding its platforms from abuse during the upcoming Indian General Election. With millions of eligible voters heading to the polls, the tech giant has said that recognises its responsibility to connect users with reliable information and counter the spread of misinformation, including AI-generated content.Easy access to voting information on Search and YouTubeGoogle has mentioned that its primary focus is on providing easy access to authoritative information from trusted sources.The company has also partnered with the Election Commission of India to showcase critical details on Google Search and YouTube, such as how to register and vote, in English and Hindi. Apart from this, YouTube’s recommendation system will prioritise trusted content during the election season. Additionally, YouTube’s homepage will prominently showcase trusted content along with an “Up Next” panel to make election-related details easily available for users. YouTube will also highlight content from trusted sources during key moments through its Top News and Breaking News as well as a news watch page. Moreover, the tech giant has also set up information panels that indicate funding sources from publishers that receive public or government funding and information panels that provide topical context for topics prone to misinformation. Safeguarding misinformationTo protect the integrity of the electoral process and to protect its products and services from abuse, Google has re-inforced its existing policies to keep its products and platforms safe while curbing misinformation at the same time. Also, the policies apply to all users, irrespective of the content type. The company has employed a combination of human reviewers and artificial intelligence models to identify and remove content that violates these policies. Google's AI capabilities are enhancing its abuse-fighting efforts, enabling faster action against emerging threats.Advertising during election campaignsTo keep things transparent when it comes to election advertising, the company requires advertisers to undergo identity verification and provide necessary certifications from the Election Commission. Election ads must also include disclosures indicating the advertiser's identity and location. Google maintains a searchable hub for all election ads, providing insights into the advertisers and their spending.Restricting AI-generated contentGoogle has also taken some steps to help identify AI-generated content through new tools and policies. The company has introduced disclosure requirements for election ads containing synthetic content and will soon require creators on YouTube to label realistic altered or synthetic content. The new ad policies prohibit the use of manipulated media to mislead people, like deepfakes or doctored content.Google has also implemented restrictions to Gemini on the types of election-related queries it will respond to and has also prioritised the provision of high-quality information. Additional features, such as the "About this Image" tool in Search and digital watermarking for AI-generated images, aim to provide users with context and assess credibility.Furthermore, Google has joined the C2PA coalition, a cross-industry effort to provide transparency and context for AI-generated content. The company has confirmed the deployment of technology to counter harmful AI-generated content aimed at deceiving voters during the 2024 elections.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

TSMC's stock rallied, elevating its market capitalisation to a record, making it higher than Broadcom. Analysts expect TSMC to further advance amid surging AI-related revenue and strong pricing power.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has reclaimed a spot in the list of the world’s 10 most valuable companies, riding the optimism of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom in the tech industry that pushed its stock to record levels.According to a report by Bloomberg, TSMC’s stock rallied 14% last week, elevating the chipmaker’s market capitalisation to a record, before a 2% decline in early trading on Monday (March 11), pared it to $634 billion. However, the decline didn’t impact the company much as it still has a market share higher than that of Broadcom, the report noted.What analysts have to sayAnalysts from Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. expect the semiconductor giant – that has Apple, Nvidia and Qualcomm as its customers – to advance further amid surging AI-related revenue and strong pricing power. “Generative AI semi is an obvious growth driver for TSMC,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Charlie Chan wrote in a note last week. The company’s overseas expansion also helps mitigate geopolitical concerns, they said.TSMC’s revenue gained 9.4% in the first two months of 2024 as demand for high-end chips increased due to a wave of activity in AI.Nvidia gets ‘AI boost’This is not the first time this year that a chip company has seen its stock on an upward spiral. This year, Nvidia was among the companies that got a boost by a frenzy around generative AI.In the last month, Nvidia stock price has risen over 20% while in the last six months, it has risen over 90%. Moreover, in the last one year, Nvidia stock price has appreciated from $234.36 per share level to $875.28 per share mark – registering a 275% jump.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

The update combines gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer data, reducing magnetic interference and benefiting Google Maps and third-party apps on Android 5.0 or above. Google Maps is updating its Fused Orientation Provider (FOP) API to improve direction accuracy in busy areas. The update combines gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer data, reducing magnetic interference and benefiting Google Maps and third-party apps on Android 5.0 or above. We keep hearing about Google Maps fiasco from across the globe where it directed people in some odd direction and eventually got them stuck in a ‘worst case scenario’. Now a new post published on the Android Developers blog gives an insight about Maps getting a new update to better with directions. The post talks about a potential upgrade that Maps will be getting with the Fused Orientation Provider (FOP) API that aims to make the ‘orientation’ detection better on Android devices, irrespective of the hardware used by different OEMs on their devices. According to the post, the update will make Maps interpret the directions better to make it more accurate by combining the gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer data. However, this idea of Google using data from all the sensors isn’t new, the company has used the API before, but the update will make better magnetic interference. As per the post, the changes will not only apply to Google Maps but also third-party apps that rely on Google Maps to offer navigational data. It is to be noted that the update will be done with internals of the Google Maps, it won’t affect the user interface or the layout of the app. Also, the updated API will be rolled out from the server side or via the app update in Android devices running Android 5.0 or above. How it will affect usersAs mentioned, the update won’t change anything in terms of the app’s design or user interface. The changes are internal in the form of API which will be pushed automatically via the update. That said, the update is set to make it better with directions, especially in busy areas.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Musk announces xAI open sourcing Grok chatbot. OpenAI CEO Altman takes a dig at Musk's chatbot. Musk, obviously didn't like the jab and replied with a long-ish message saying “GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.”  Elon Musk has been extremely critical of ChatGPT maker OpenAI for deviating from its mission to develop AI for the benefit of humanity and taking a profit-making path. He has advocated that artificial intelligence (AI) should be accessible for all, and he has now announced that his AI startup xAI will open source Grok chatbot this week.“This week, @xAI will open source Grok,” Musk said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).In simpler words, open-sourcing a software, like a chatbot, means that the software projects are redistributable as all source code is accessible by everyone. One of the advantages of having open source software is that it provides flexibility to an enterprise to have multiple ways of fixing a problem rather than waiting for an internal team to provide a solution.“OpenAI is a lie”Meanwhile, a user suggested that OpenAI should do the same.“OpenAI should do the same if they are ‘open’ that is,” the user said. Musk replied, “OpenAI is a lie.”Musk wants AI technology to be open-source Musk had floated the idea of open-sourcing AI during a podcast in November last year. In a podcast with Lex Fridman, Musk suggested that he likes the idea of open-source AI. “I am generally in favour of open sourcing, like biassed towards open sourcing,” he said.His comments came soon after his AI company called xAI released Grok, its chatbot, which reportedly took four months to build. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was quick to take a dig at this and shared a post in which he built Grok with a single prompt on GPT Builder."GPTs can save a lot of effort:” he said.Musk, obviously didn't like the jab and replied with a long-ish message saying “GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.” About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Ruby Johnson filed a lawsuit against Detective Gary Staab and Sgt. Gregory Buschy.  Apple's Find My app has cost the city of Denver, US $3.76 million in compensation and damages. In 2022, the city’s police wrongly raided and ransacked an elderly woman's home looking for a stolen truck and guns. According to a report by CNN, Denver police were seeking to recover a stolen truck loaded with guns, ammo and cash. For this, the police used Apple's Find My technology on another iPhone to locate the vehicle.However, the police picked the wrong house out of a fairly wide area to storm in and catch the thieves. Due to this misplaced raid, 78-year-old Ruby Johnson filed a lawsuit against the police. As compensation, the city will be paying Johnson a $3.76 million award. Moreover, the defendant officers — Detective Gary Staab and Sgt. Gregory Buschy — were also sued as an individual. Denver police had previously cleared both men of wrongdoing, but the jury disagreed.How Apple’s Find My app played a roleThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) brought the case on behalf of Johnson. The lawsuit mentioned that the raid was conducted based on an “alleged location ping from an iPhone's Find My app that the officers did not understand and for which they had no training." As per the complaint, the police relied on a "Find My" ping from an iPhone 11 that was probably still in the stolen truck. However, the area identified included parts of six other properties across parts of four city blocks.In a statement, Johnson's attorney Tim Macdonald said: “We are disturbed by the lack of training or policy changes and hope that the amount of the punitive damages award will send a strong message that the police department must take seriously the constitutional rights of its residents.” The ACLU and the jury concluded that the two police officers who ordered the raid had no reason to single out Johnson's house as the target. Also, the officers have to pay nearly $1.25 million each in punitive and compensatory damages. A Denver District Court clerk noted that the city has not yet filed an appeal of the verdict.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

A bill to sell TikTok is introduced, backed by President Biden. Kotick discussed acquisition with OpenAI head. Activision Blizzard faced a lawsuit. Concerns about data privacy and ties to China persist. TikTok urges American users to support it.  Bobby Kotick, the former head of Activision Blizzard, is reportedly considering buying TikTok, as the app could be banned in the United States. The Wall Street Journal reports that Kotick has talked to ByteDance, the company that owns TikTok, about buying the app, which could cost hundreds of billions of dollars.This comes as US lawmakers introduce a new bill that would make ByteDance sell TikTok within six months or stop it from being available in US app stores.President Joe Biden has said he would approve the bill if it passes in Congress.The Wall Street Journal report adds that Kotick, the head of OpenAI, Sam Altman, discussed teaming up to buy TikTok at a dinner last week. Kotick's interest in TikTok follows a rough end to his 30 years leading Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft acquired last year. The company faced a lawsuit saying it allowed sexual harassment and discrimination under Kotick's leadership. The Wall Street Journal also said Kotick knew about bad behaviour and didn't tell the board everything. Kotick was accused of harassment, but Activision Blizzard said the report was "misleading."Lawmakers are worried about data privacy and TikTok's ties to China. US President Biden, whose administration has banned the app already on state devices, has expressed his support for banning the app in the US. However, former President Donald Trump, who once wanted to ban TikTok, has changed his mind, saying a ban would help TikTok's rivals, like Facebook and YouTube. As the bill against TikTok gains support, the app has asked its American users to speak up for it, sending messages telling users to call their representatives. The bill, which passed a committee last week, is expected to be approved when the House votes on Wednesday. If it passes, it will then go to the Senate, and then the bill will be signed by the President of the US.Former Activision boss reportedly wants to buy TikTokAbout the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Reason is said to be delay in the delivery of two supercomputers by the French company to Indian weather forecasting institutes. According to a report in news agency PTI, the Earth Sciences Ministry had ordered two supercomputers worth $100 million from French firm Eviden, of the Atos Group, last year to enhance the computing capabilities of its institutions -- the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM)."I am more upset because the target we set was December. The Union Cabinet had already approved purchasing the supercomputer. We have only four petaflop capacity. We want to install up to 18 petaflop capacity," Rijiju told PTI in a video interview.He said that the French company ran into some financial trouble and wanted the government to make payment to its subsidiary.Minister says that the delay is causing him "worry"Rijiju said that the delay has caused him lots of worry as the company has overshot the timeline. "But I think we will sort it out soon," he said, adding that the government wanted to be "very correct in our position legally"."We are ready to release the money because we want the machine immediately. The only problem is the amount is not small. So if we pay now, if the company is bankrupt or something happens, who will bail out," the minister said.Rijiju further added that the government was taking some steps to speed up the delivery of the supercomputer but did not elaborate. "But I hope the French government will also intervene because we have a good understanding and a very good relationship with the French government."Since it is a high-cost equipment, we want to ensure that the transaction happens duly and properly," he said."From outside, everything's ready. It is only the problem with the main company. They want us to pay their subsidiary. We will pay only to a company whom we have entered an MoU with," Rijiju said.The supercomputing system, based on Eviden's BullSequana XH2000, is said to have a combined power capacity of up to 21.3 petaflops.Supercomputer at IITMThe supercomputer at the Pune-based IITM will provide 13 petaflops of computing power for atmosphere and climate research. As per the PTI report, it will integrate 3,000 CPU nodes using AMD EPYC 7643 processors and 26 GPU nodes through NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. The system will benefit from the NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand networking platform with In-Network Computing, 3PB all flash and 29PB disk-based DDN EXAScaler ES400NVX2 storage and Micron high-technology memory.The existing computing facility at NCMRWF is 2.8 petaflops and at IITM is 4 petaflops, respectively.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Beyond nostalgia, writing by hand enhances comprehension, stimulates creativity, reduces digital distractions, and fosters deliberate thinking. Blending traditional pen-and-paper practices with modern technology, this age-old method offers a practical, scientifically supported strategy for mastering learning in a hyper-connected academic world.  Amid the constant influx of digital information and instant transcription tools, the simple act of reaching for a notebook and pen might seem almost antiquated. Yet, in 2025, handwriting notes is emerging not as a quaint habit but as a rigorously supported method to enhance focus, fortify memory, and cultivate deeper cognitive engagement. For students contending with relentless informational saturation, this seemingly modest practice may delineate the boundary between superficial consumption and profound comprehension. Handwriting transcends mere transcription; it establishes a tangible, cognitive imprint of knowledge that endures well beyond the lecture hall.Cognitive engagement Typing often permits rote recording, allowing the mind to disengage from the material. Handwriting, in contrast, necessitates distillation, paraphrasing, and prioritization. This active involvement reinforces neural pathways, facilitating more robust recall. By summarizing in one’s own words, students refine critical thinking and discern conceptual gaps that digital transcription alone cannot illuminate. Over time, handwritten notes foster a fluidity of thought, enabling the comprehension of intricate concepts with greater ease.Deliberate processing The velocity of typing frequently surpasses the pace of thought. Handwriting, inherently slower, aligns more harmoniously with cognitive assimilation. The interval between listening and recording cultivates reflection, clarity, and nuanced understanding. By granting the mind time to process information before committing it to paper, students mitigate cognitive overload. This deliberate cadence encourages inquiry and connection-making, fostering intellectual curiosity often lost in rapid digital note-taking.Mitigation of digital distractions The ubiquity of laptops and tablets invites constant interruption. A notebook offers an insulated environment, free from the incessant tug of notifications and multitasking. Handwriting creates a sanctuary of focus, shielding the mind from external intrusions. Beyond mere attention preservation, the discipline of manual note-taking cultivates self-regulation and sustained concentration—attributes indispensable in contemporary academia.Enhanced memory consolidation Extensive research underscores that handwriting bolsters retention. The multisensory experience—tactile, visual, and kinesthetic—anchors information more effectively than typing alone. Students frequently employ handwritten summaries to solidify knowledge prior to examinations, harnessing the cognitive “hooks” created through manual transcription. The integration of muscle memory further strengthens recall, rendering retention more intuitive and enduring.Catalysis of creative cognition The physical act of writing stimulates creativity in ways a keyboard rarely does. Mind maps, annotations, and sketches enable visual and conceptual exploration that digital layouts constrain. Handwriting facilitates organic idea evolution, fostering lateral thinking and unexpected connections. Students report that this tactile engagement often precipitates profound insights, illustrating the cognitive potency of pen-on-paper methodologies.Deepened focus during review Typed notes can inadvertently encourage cursory skimming. Handwritten notes, imbued with personal structure and idiosyncrasy, serve as cognitive anchors, reviving the context and thought process of the original lecture. Revisiting these notes not only reinforces memory but also nurtures analytical reflection. This embodied recall transforms passive review into active intellectual engagement.Stress attenuation Handwriting possesses an inherently meditative quality. Within high-pressure academic environments, it functions as both a focus-enhancing and anxiety-alleviating practice. The rhythmic act of writing promotes mental clarity and fosters a contemplative mindset. Initiating study sessions with handwritten notes often establishes a tone of disciplined calm, enhancing productivity and cognitive resilience.Harmonizing analog and digital modalities Embracing handwriting need not entail forsaking technology. Stylus-enabled tablets permit the integration of analog benefits with digital convenience, preserving the cognitive advantages of manual transcription while enabling organization, searchability, and cloud storage. This hybrid approach ensures that handwriting remains a contemporary, scalable, and pedagogically sound strategy. In the pursuit of cutting-edge learning technologies, handwriting may appear anachronistic. Yet precisely because it demands intentionality, it retains exceptional value. For students navigating the intellectual demands of 2025, this enduring practice offers a potent, modern solution for cultivating focus, comprehension, and cognitive mastery.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

SC refuses to relax 3-year law practice rule for judicial services exam, says it will open ‘Pandora’s box’
The Supreme Court has refused to relax its May 20 verdict mandating a minimum three-year law practice for appearing in entry-level judicial services exams. A Madhya Pradesh judge had sought recognition of judicial officers’ experience, but the bench led by CJI B R Gavai said allowing it would “open Pandora’s box,” dismissing the plea.

A Madhya Pradesh judge had sought recognition of judicial officers’ experience, but the bench led by CJI B R Gavai said allowing it would “open Pandora’s box,” dismissing the plea.  The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to modify its verdict mandating a minimum three-year law practice criterion for law graduates to appear in entry-level judicial services examinations, saying any relaxation would open a “Pandora's box.” The top court was hearing a plea filed by a judge from Madhya Pradesh seeking a modification of the verdict to allow serving judicial officers to take the exam by considering their judicial experience.

Paul Graham, English-American computer scientist, entrepreneur, essayist, and investor, offers a grounded perspective. In a recent post on X, he advised aspiring founders: “Don’t drop out of college to start or work for a startup. There will be other (and probably better) startup opportunities, but you can’t get your college years back.” His advice highlights the value of a full college experience, even for those drawn to the fast-paced world of startups, setting the tone for why students should weigh education alongside ambition.From Cornell to Harvard: Building a foundationGraham’s academic journey illustrates the importance of a diverse and rigorous educational foundation. He earned a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree from Cornell University and a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Computer Science from Harvard University. Beyond conventional academics, he also studied painting at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) and the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence, blending analytical thinking with creative exploration. For students, this underscores the value of education as a platform for versatile skills and long-term preparation.Shaping technology and entrepreneurshipGraham’s work spans multiple domains, combining programming, startups, and writing. In 1995, he co-founded Viaweb with Robert Morris, the first software-as-a-service company, which was acquired by Yahoo in 1998 and became Yahoo Store. He also created the programming language Arc and published influential books, including On Lisp (1993), ANSI Common Lisp (1995), and Hackers & Painters (2004).In 2005, Graham co-founded Y Combinator with Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Trevor Blackwell, establishing one of the first modern startup incubators. Y Combinator has since funded over 3,000 startups, including Airbnb, Dropbox, Stripe, and Reddit. His career demonstrates that strategic preparation, knowledge, and timing often precede entrepreneurial success.Why students should not rushGraham’s post on X highlights a common misperception in startup culture: That leaving college early is the fastest route to success. His advice emphasizes that college offers more than technical skills or credentials. It is a space to develop critical thinking, resilience, and communication skills — qualities that are indispensable in any professional or entrepreneurial pursuit. Beyond academics, college provides a structured environment to experiment, fail safely, and learn from mistakes without the high stakes of a live business environment. Students also gain access to mentorship, peer collaboration, and exposure to disciplines beyond their immediate field of interest, which can spark innovative thinking that informs future ventures. By rushing through these formative years, students risk missing the opportunity to cultivate the intellectual depth, emotional maturity, and professional networks that often distinguish long-term success from short-term wins.College years as an irreplaceable investmentThe experiences, networks, and structured learning gained during college cannot be replicated outside the academic environment. While startup culture celebrates rapid execution and early launches, Graham's perspective stresses the long-term value of preparation. The combination of intellectual growth, exposure to new ideas, and creative exploration provides students with a foundation that is difficult to achieve in a rushed entrepreneurial environment.Balancing ambition with learningGraham’s own journey reinforces this principle. Beyond academics, his continuous writing on paulgraham.com attracts around 25 million annual page views, illustrating how sustained contribution, reflection, and disciplined skill-building can create impact that outlasts immediate business opportunities. Students aspiring to launch startups can take a measured approach: Focus on building knowledge, refining skills, and nurturing networks while completing their academic journey.In today’s competitive landscape, Graham’s advice resonates: College years are finite, valuable, and formative. Startups will continue to present opportunities, but the preparation, perspective, and resilience cultivated during higher education often provide a lasting advantage. His counsel on X serves as a reminder to students that thoughtful preparation often outweighs early execution, and that investing in education is an investment in long-term success.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

He says ignoring AI is not an option. Students must graduate with AI knowledge. Classrooms need to evolve with technology. AI fluency is the new job currency for workers. Roles combining human skills with AI will flourish. Adapting to AI is essential for everyone to stay relevant in their respective fields.  Apple CEO Tim Cook, during a recent staff gathering at Apple’s Cupertino headquarters, is said to have stressed that those who don’t embrace AI risk being left behind, Bloomberg reported. His comments reflect Apple’s growing focus on artificial intelligence and highlight how critical the technology is becoming—not just for the company’s strategy, but for the broader future of work.For students preparing to enter the job market, educators shaping tomorrow’s workforce, and professionals navigating disruption, Cook’s words read less like a prediction and more like a survival guide. The age of AI is here, and adapting to it has become a career necessity.Students can’t afford to graduate without AI literacyFor young people, the AI shift is both a challenge and an opportunity. The next decade’s graduates will enter a job market defined by automation and data-driven decision-making. Choosing courses in artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, or cloud computing is no longer just an option for aspiring technologists—it’s a pathway to relevance across nearly every industry.Beyond formal study, short-term certifications from providers such as Google and IBM are increasingly valued by employers looking for evidence of practical experience. And while technical proficiency matters, students must also grasp the broader implications of AI—how it shapes ethics, privacy, and society at large. Employers are beginning to see AI literacy in the same way they once saw computer literacy: essential for everyone, not just specialists.Classrooms must evolve as fast as the technologyCook’s warning has implications for educators as well. If students are to thrive in an AI-driven economy, teachers and universities must bring AI into the learning environment. Adaptive platforms, AI-powered assessment tools, and personalized learning software are already changing classrooms, allowing educators to tailor instruction to individual needs.But adopting these tools is not enough. Teachers themselves must keep pace with new developments through ongoing professional training. By modeling adaptability and continuous learning, educators can prepare students not only with technical know-how but also with the resilience to succeed in a rapidly shifting job market.For workers, AI fluency is the new job currencyFor those already in the workforce, the urgency is even greater. Across industries, “AI fluency” is emerging as a key hiring and promotion criterion. Companies are no longer asking whether employees can code AI models but whether they can work productively alongside AI tools—whether in data analysis, project management, education, or customer service.The fastest-growing opportunities are in roles that combine technology with sector expertise: AI specialists, data analysts, instructional designers, and ed-tech professionals. For mid-career workers, reskilling and apprenticeships in AI-related fields can provide a vital bridge to new opportunities. The days when digital skills were optional are over—AI literacy is becoming the new baseline.Blending human and machine is the futureWhile AI is unlikely to eliminate every job, it is changing the rules of work. Routine-heavy, entry-level positions are most at risk of automation. By contrast, roles that combine human judgment with AI-powered efficiency are expected to flourish. Doctors who use AI to assist diagnosis, teachers who enhance lessons with adaptive platforms, or financial analysts who interpret AI-driven insights will remain indispensable.The qualities that cannot be automated—strategic thinking, creativity, empathy, and problem-solving—will grow in importance. Professionals who can blend these human strengths with the power of AI will be best placed to thrive.The bottom lineCook’s comments, as reported by Bloomberg, were directed at Apple employees but resonate far beyond Cupertino. His message is stark: ignoring AI is no longer an option. Students, educators, and professionals must embrace it, learn to work with it, and continuously adapt if they want to remain relevant.The AI era is not on the horizon—it is already here. Those who move with it will shape the future. Those who resist risk being left behind.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future.

Sam Altman left Stanford to create OpenAI. Greg Brockman moved from Harvard to MIT before co-founding OpenAI. Adam Selipsky used his Harvard degrees to lead Amazon Web Services. Mark Zuckerberg's Harvard project became Meta. Tim Cook's degrees from Auburn and Duke helped him lead Apple.  From Stanford dorm rooms to Harvard lecture halls, the world’s most powerful tech leaders often began their journeys in academia. Some completed advanced degrees, others famously dropped out, yet all used their educational experiences as springboards into innovation. Here’s a closer look at seven leaders steering global technology, and the universities that shaped them.Sam Altman – CEO, OpenAIEducation: Studied Computer Science at Stanford University (dropped out)Sam Altman grew up in Missouri and briefly studied computer science at Stanford before leaving to pursue entrepreneurship.

After a long stint at Amazon and a CEO role at Tableau Software, he returned to lead AWS in 2021, guiding the world’s largest cloud services provider.Mark Zuckerberg – Co-founder and CEO, Meta (Facebook)Education: Studied Computer Science and Psychology at Harvard University (dropped out)Mark Zuckerberg’s Harvard dorm room project in 2004 grew into Meta (formerly Facebook), transforming global communication and social networking. Though he left Harvard to pursue Facebook full-time, the university setting provided the spark — and early team — that launched one of the most influential companies in tech history.Tim Cook – CEO, AppleEducation: Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering, Auburn University; MBA from Duke University’s Fuqua School of BusinessTim Cook’s mix of engineering precision and business acumen has defined his leadership at Apple. After earning degrees from Auburn and Duke, Cook worked at IBM and Compaq before joining Apple in 1998.

Harvard strips 900 graduate students from union coverage: Why the university says research isn’t considered work
Harvard University has removed over 900 graduate students on research stipends from union coverage, sparking disputes over whether research counts as employment. Students now lose pay protections, benefits, and union representation under HGSU-UAW. The union has filed grievances, calling Harvard’s move arbitrary and harmful. The conflict highlights broader debates over graduate student labor rights and academic work classifications.

Students now lose pay protections, benefits, and union representation under HGSU-UAW. The union has filed grievances, calling Harvard’s move arbitrary and harmful. The conflict highlights broader debates over graduate student labor rights and academic work classifications.  When Lindsey E. Adams, a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) student in Harvard’s virology program, opened her July 1 pay stub, she noticed something unsettling. Her research stipend was no longer listed as a union stipend, and no union dues were being deducted. Yet nothing about her day-to-day work had changed — not her hours, her supervisor, the lab, or the tasks she performed.Adams was among more than 900 graduate students on research-based stipends removed from the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Automobile Workers’ (HGSU-UAW) bargaining unit shortly after the union’s second contract with the University expired in June, as reported by The Harvard Crimson. Without union representation, these students are now excluded from contract protections, including benefits, access to union funds, and the pay raises currently under negotiation in the union’s third contract.Understanding the University’s rationale The removals have prompted questions about Harvard’s criteria for excluding students who the University asserts are not employees. More than a month after the change, the HGSU-UAW is still trying to determine whether there is a path to appeal the decision, according to reporting by The Harvard Crimson. While unions might normally contest such actions by filing an unfair labor practice (ULP) charge with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the political composition of the board complicates matters. Michael C. Harper, professor emeritus of labor law at Boston University, noted to The Harvard Crimson that under the Trump administration’s pending appointments to the NLRB, “a case involving student workers could be used to eliminate students’ right to unionize. Such a decision would be a near certainty.” For now, the union is pursuing the grievance procedures outlined in its contract. Officials filed a grievance against Harvard on July 21 and submitted a request for information on July 30, The Harvard Crimson reported. The grievance alleges multiple contract violations, including those related to the composition of the bargaining unit and worker classifications. The union also contends that the removal violates the union security clause, which enables automatic paycheck deductions for dues. According to HGSU-UAW financial secretary Simon A. Warchol, a Computer Science Ph.D. student, the union risks losing “anywhere from 25 to 40% of the dues that Harvard automatically deducts from workers’ paychecks each month,” as he told The Harvard Crimson.A unilateral interpretation HGSU-UAW vice president Sudipta Saha told The Harvard Crimson, “We believe this violates not just the unit definition that we have in the contract, but the union definition that we have operated on ever since we’ve had the first elections whose results were certified by the NLRB. They very explicitly say that all research assistants are included, regardless of funding source, and the University has decided to kind of unilaterally change their interpretation.” Harvard, in contrast, maintains that the excluded students are not employees covered by the contract. The University has argued that stipended students’ research does not constitute employment because it supports their academic work towards a degree and is not tied to performing specific tasks for compensation. Harvard Law School professors Sharon Block, Benjamin I. Sachs, and Laura M. Weinrib ’00, writing for OnLabor, called this rationale “implausible” and noted that it “runs counter to recent history in the law and at Harvard.” They referenced a 2024 MIT decision excluding stipended fellows from union coverage but argued that it does not automatically justify Harvard’s action. The professors concluded to The Harvard Crimson, “It would be surprising, in other words, if no Harvard graduate student who receives a stipend does any work that is controlled by Harvard.”Navigating grievance procedures The union met with Harvard officials on August 4 under Step One of the grievance process. In his official response, Director of Labor and Employment Relations Brian Magner wrote to the union that “the University finds no contractual violation has occurred and therefore the grievance is denied,” as detailed by The Harvard Crimson. If the grievance proceeds to Step Two and Harvard again rejects it, arbitration may be pursued. However, the University is likely to contend that the issue is not arbitrable, citing that the student removals occurred after the union’s contract expired on June 30. The union argues that because pay stubs on July 1 already reflected changes in union representation, the matter may indeed be subject to arbitration, according to The Harvard Crimson.Disparate impact across schools More than half of the affected students are part of Harvard Medical School’s Division of Medical Sciences. First- and second-year Ph.D. students, typically funded by the division or by National Institutes of Health grants, were heavily impacted. For third-year students and beyond, funding streams can be more complex, and removals are less uniform. Laila B. Norford, a union steward and third-year Ph.D. student in biomedical informatics, told The Harvard Crimson that “most students in hospital-based or hospital-affiliated labs have been removed, as have those fully funded on fellowships.” Adams was likely excluded because her principal investigator, Daniel Lingwood, holds a secondary appointment at Mass General Hospital’s Ragon Institute. Norford noted additional ambiguity for students funded by multiple sources: “Some workers have been partially removed from the union — union dues have been automatically deducted only from their non-stipended pay,” she told The Harvard Crimson.Student concerns and uncertainty Albert T. Chen, a fourth-year Ph.D. student and HGSU-UAW bargaining committee member, described the process as “very arbitrary” to The Harvard Crimson: “There’s some workers that are doing the same work, in the same labs, in the same program. Some are being carved out, some aren’t.” The University has maintained communication through emails, but clarity remains limited. DMS executive director Samantha Reed reiterated July 2 updates to students in a July 25 email, noting that unionized students would be paid biweekly without salary increases over last year due to ongoing negotiations, according to The Harvard Crimson. Students have also used pay periods to gauge whether they remain part of the union. Norford summarized the broader impact of the uncertainty: “It’s just kicking the scientists while we’re down. We’re already suffering and struggling so much because of what the federal government is doing, but also because of how Harvard’s responding to it. And now what they’re doing in this moment is trying to make it harder for all of us,” as she told The Harvard Crimson.The path ahead As the grievance process continues, students and union leaders are seeking transparency from the University regarding its classification decisions. The situation raises questions about how academic institutions define employment and the protections graduate student workers are entitled to. For Adams and her peers, the stakes are immediate. Union representation determines pay, benefits, and workplace protections, and Harvard’s stance marks a significant shift in how the University defines the work performed by research-based graduate students.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

While the university emphasizes financial aid availability, the high sticker price raises questions about accessibility and the value of an Ivy League education compared to global alternatives.  The cost of an Ivy League education has once again crossed new thresholds. At Brown University, one of the United States’ most prestigious institutions, the estimated annual cost of pursuing an undergraduate degree in economics for the 2025–26 academic year stands at a staggering $96,284. This amount includes not just tuition but also housing, meals, fees, books, and personal expenses, bringing the four-year total to nearly $385,136.The figures, released by Brown’s admissions and financial aid offices, reflect the full “sticker price” for students without financial aid, making Brown one of the costliest destinations for higher education globally.The cost breakdown for 2025–26Over four years, the cost of an economics degree at Brown is projected to exceed $385,000, excluding additional expenses like travel and health insurance.Here is an estimated annual cost breakdown:ExpenseAnnual Estimate (USD)Tuition$71,700Fees$2,950Housing$10,410Food$8,104Books/Materials$1,300Personal$2,820Miscellaneous$4,120Total$96,284Tuition at Brown crosses $70,000 markOne of the most striking developments is that Brown’s tuition alone has crossed $70,000 for the first time in its history [10]. This milestone is emblematic of a larger trend across the Ivy League and other elite U.S. universities, where annual increases in tuition continue to outpace inflation and average income growth.For families across North America, Europe, Asia, and beyond, this raises difficult questions: is the prestige of an Ivy League degree still worth the price, or are there more sustainable alternatives abroad?Sticker price vs. real priceWhile the published figures are intimidating, Brown emphasises that they do not reflect the “real” cost most students pay. According to the university:Need-based aid: Brown follows a need-blind admissions policy for US applicants and a need-aware system for international students. The institution claims to meet 100% of demonstrated financial need.Scholarships and grants: These can significantly reduce costs, with some students paying a fraction of the sticker price.Work-study opportunities: On-campus jobs provide modest earnings to cover incidental expenses.However, access to aid is uneven. US students typically benefit more from generous packages, while international applicants face tougher competition and stricter eligibility.Global context: How Brown comparesBrown’s $96,000 annual cost is among the highest in the world. For comparison:Other Ivy League universities like Harvard, Yale, and Princeton have similar sticker prices, though their aid packages often bring net costs down.Top UK universities such as Oxford and Cambridge charge international undergraduates in economics roughly £35,000–£40,000 per year ($45,000–$50,000), about half of Brown’s total cost when housing and living expenses are factored in.European universities in countries like Germany, France, and the Netherlands offer competitive economics programs with much lower tuition fees, though living expenses can vary.This contrast highlights the widening gap between US elite institutions and their global peers in terms of affordability.The value questionSupporters of Brown’s pricing model argue that the return on investment justifies the cost. An Ivy League degree, they say, offers unparalleled academic resources, access to top faculty, global networking opportunities, and a career launchpad that often pays off in the long term.Critics, however, counter that skyrocketing tuition risks pricing out talented students, eroding diversity, and fuelling questions about whether US higher education has become a privilege only for the wealthy or the heavily indebted.The bottom lineAt more than $96,000 per year, studying economics at Brown University in 2025–26 underscores both the enduring prestige and the daunting expense of an Ivy League education. While financial aid can ease the burden for many, the full price tag places Brown among the most expensive universities in the world.For families and students worldwide, the decision comes down to weighing the prestige of Ivy League credentials against the very real challenge of affordability in an era of escalating education costs.Ready to navigate global policies?

Harvard’s class of 2029 secures an 85% yield, yet arrives under fire from Trump-era attacks on diversity and admissions
Harvard's Class of 2029 boasts a strong 85% yield despite political challenges, including scrutiny of international students and admissions policies. The incoming class maintains diversity in gender, socioeconomic background, and geography, with significant financial aid support. However, the university faces pressure to adjust admissions in response to federal funding concerns and the Supreme Court's ruling on race-conscious admissions.

The incoming class maintains diversity in gender, socioeconomic background, and geography, with significant financial aid support. However, the university faces pressure to adjust admissions in response to federal funding concerns and the Supreme Court's ruling on race-conscious admissions.  Harvard University's Class of 2029 will arrive on campus this fall with an impressive 85 percent of admitted students choosing to enroll, according to preliminary data first reported by The Harvard Crimson. The strong yield comes despite a turbulent political climate in which the Trump administration has escalated attacks on international students, financial aid programs, and the broader framework of college admissions.The figures, shared during a confidential May 27 meeting with undergraduates leading pre-orientation programs, marked the first detailed glimpse of the incoming class. As The Crimson noted, the 1,654 students who had matriculated by that date represent a slight rise in Harvard’s yield compared with recent years, even as Washington’s scrutiny of elite universities intensifies.International students under pressureRoughly 15.8 percent of the Class of 2029 are international students, a proportion consistent with previous years, The Crimson reported. Yet their place at Harvard has become more precarious. The Department of Homeland Security has twice attempted to revoke Harvard’s authorisation to host foreign students, and a June 4 presidential proclamation barred international students from entering the U.S. to attend the university — a move temporarily blocked in federal court.To hedge against such disruptions, admissions dean Joy St. John said the College admitted 25 to 30 additional students this year, citing concerns that visa denials or political barriers could keep some international admits from enrolling, according to The Crimson.Race, diversity, and the Supreme Court rulingThe Class of 2029 is the second admitted after the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, which struck down the use of race-conscious admissions. Unlike in past decades, Harvard has not released racial or ethnic breakdowns of its incoming students and plans to wait until mandated by the Department of Education later this year.The Trump administration has seized on the ruling, accusing universities of using recruiting practices and essay prompts to “circumvent” restrictions on race. In April, the White House froze more than $2.7 billion in Harvard’s federal funding and demanded that the university adopt “merit-based” policies or lose access to grants — a move Harvard President Alan M. Garber '76 was denounced as coercive and beyond federal authority.Who makes up the Class of 2029Beyond politics, the Class of 2029 reflects familiar trends in Harvard’s admissions. According to The Crimson:Women make up 52 percent of the class, continuing a majority-female streak since 2024.21 percent are first-generation college students.24 percent are Pell Grant-eligible.More than half (54 percent) will receive institutional grant aid, while nearly a quarter will pay nothing to attend. Harvard announced in March that tuition will be free for students from families earning $100,000 or less.Geographically, 20 percent of students come from the mid-Atlantic, 18 percent from New England, and 16 percent from the South, with smaller shares from the Midwest, Pacific, and Mountain states.17 veterans will join the class, representing service across the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps.In academic interests, 34.6 percent plan to study social sciences, 26.6 percent natural sciences, 25.5 percent engineering, and 11.7 percent humanities.A class caught in the crossfireWhile Harvard celebrates an 85 percent yield, the political backdrop is impossible to ignore. Columbia University recently regained frozen federal funding only after agreeing to review its international admissions and reduce dependence on foreign students. A similar bargain could soon be forced on Harvard.For now, the Class of 2029 embodies both continuity and controversy: strong academic and geographic diversity, historic levels of financial support, and a yield rate the envy of nearly every other university — all arriving in Cambridge under a storm cloud of political scrutiny.Ready to navigate global policies?

Beyond elite universities: How Trump’s funding cuts threatened the survival of tribal colleges in the US
Trump's budget proposals threatened to slash funding for tribal colleges, cutting support by 83% and jeopardising institutions like Nebraska Indian Community College and Little Priest Tribal College. Though Congress blocked the cuts, the episode exposed the fragile finances of America’s 37 tribal colleges, which serve as vital cultural and educational lifelines for Native communities.

Though Congress blocked the cuts, the episode exposed the fragile finances of America’s 37 tribal colleges, which serve as vital cultural and educational lifelines for Native communities. A sign of welcome at Little Priest Tribal College in Winnebago, Nebraska. When conversations around higher education funding in the United States turn political, the spotlight usually falls on elite institutions such as Harvard or Columbia. But as The New York Times reported, this spring, the financial anxieties stirred by the Trump administration’s budget proposals were felt most acutely far from Ivy-covered campuses. They landed hardest on the country’s 37 tribal colleges and universities, institutions almost wholly reliant on federal support to survive.A fragile funding ecosystem The Nebraska Indian Community College (NICC), chartered by the Omaha Tribe of Nebraska and the Santee Sioux Nation, stands along a two-lane highway near the Iowa border. It is one of the tribal colleges that depend on the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), which has historically underwritten these institutions under federal laws and treaties. When the Trump administration proposed cutting the BIE’s budget for tribal colleges to 22 million US dollars from 183 million, leaders at schools like NICC were forced to contemplate scenarios where classrooms might simply fall silent. NICC president Michael Oltrogge told The New York Times that even with one of the strongest reserve funds in tribal higher education — valued at about 5 million US dollars — the college could only keep its doors open for a year if the cuts materialised. Nearby, Little Priest Tribal College president Manoj Patil estimated his institution could stretch six months longer. “There’s billions and billions of dollars of money out there, and you’re looking at the smallest speck, and you’re taking that by 83%?” he said incredulously, noting that most tribal colleges “don’t have much of anything.”Congressional pushback, but lasting unease Two congressional committees rejected the proposed cuts last month, signalling that the reductions were unlikely to pass in any final federal budget. Yet the episode underscored what The New York Times described as “the fragile finances of America’s tribal colleges.” Even when budgets are preserved, administrators live with deep uncertainty, aware that annual funding remains at the mercy of shifting political priorities. Ahniwake Rose, president of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, told the Times that the real damage often extends beyond accounting sheets: “It’s students not knowing: ‘Do I even start school right now? What’s the point?’”Anchors of education and culture The stakes are particularly high because tribal colleges serve roles that go far beyond conventional higher education. They often act as community anchors in rural areas where no other college-level teaching exists for dozens of miles. Programs range from chemistry and truck driving to Indigenous language preservation. Little Priest Tribal College, chartered by the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska, is the only college in the US that teaches Ho-Chunk, the language of the Winnebago people. At NICC, some classes meet in an earth lodge, and this fall the institution will debut its second baccalaureate degree, focused on Indigenous environmental health. Enrollment has been rising. The Times reported that NICC had 273 Native students last fall, more than doubling from 109 in 2018. For many, the choice is not simply academic but personal. Student Rosalind Grant explained that after struggling with “culture shock” at a state university, she found belonging at NICC. “It helped me create my sense of my Native American identity,” she said.A contested responsibility The administration offered little explanation for its proposal, which also included cuts to K-12 and construction budgets within the Bureau of Indian Education. The Interior Department later issued a statement, quoted by The New York Times, promising commitment to “academic excellence, student well-being and culturally relevant instruction.” But for many educators, the episode raised deeper questions about the government’s recognition of treaty obligations. Wynema Morris, who teaches Native American studies at NICC, described the proposal as evidence of disregard for commitments made under duress. “We gave up the real estate — at the point of a gun and treaties,” she said. “But what did we ever get for it in return, except death, disease and destruction?”The road ahead For now, congressional intervention has kept tribal colleges afloat. Yet administrators remain cautious. “Tribal colleges live paycheck to paycheck,” Patil told the Times, capturing the precarious balance between resilience and vulnerability that defines these institutions. As the policy debate continues in Washington, the larger reality is clear: While the national conversation gravitates toward elite universities, the survival of tribal colleges — small in scale, but profound in cultural and educational importance — depends on decisions made in federal budgets year after year.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

A decade of funding, campaigns, and rhetoric later, California’s women in STEM are still waiting for real progress
Despite a decade of investment and pledges, California's STEM fields still struggle with gender parity. Women's representation in engineering and computer science has only slightly increased, while math has seen a decline. Budget cuts to women's programs and a shift in focus towards men's issues have further hindered progress, impacting economic growth and national security.

Women's representation in engineering and computer science has only slightly increased, while math has seen a decline. Budget cuts to women's programs and a shift in focus towards men's issues have further hindered progress, impacting economic growth and national security. California’s women in STEM are still waiting for real progress A decade of pledges, grants, and high-minded speeches was supposed to fix the gender gap in science and technology. Instead, California’s latest numbers tell a familiar, and frustrating, story: women remain a minority in nearly every STEM field, despite years of investment and political posturing.According to an analysis by the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC), reported by AP News, women’s share of engineering and computer science degrees has inched upward over the past ten years, but only by single digits. In mathematics, the pipeline has actually gone backward.“The unfortunate news is that the numbers haven’t changed much at all,” Hans Johnson, a senior fellow at PPIC, told AP News. “At this pace it would take a very long time to reach parity.”Millions invested, but the gap won’t budgeBetween 2009 and 2023, women earning engineering degrees crept from about 19% to 25%. In computer science, from 16% to 23%. Those numbers look less like a breakthrough and more like a rounding error in the fight for equality.Meanwhile, women hold 42% of California’s jobs overall — but just a quarter of STEM roles, according to a Mount Saint Mary’s University study cited by AP News. In some areas, like math, women are even losing ground compared to five or ten years ago.“It’s a cultural phenomenon, not a biological phenomenon,” UC Merced applied math professor Mayya Tokman told AP News. Translation: women aren’t disappearing from science because they can’t hack it, but because the system continues to push them out — through stereotypes, uneven education, and a shortage of role models.Politics pulls the plugThe problem isn’t just cultural — it’s political. When California finally started making investments in closing equity gaps, budget cuts gutted the effort. A program launched in 2018 to expand women’s access to science and technology began with $10 million annually. Today, its budget has been cut nearly in half.And Washington hasn’t helped. “We need more people in STEM. More people means immigrants, women, people of colour as well as white men. There’s no point in excluding anyone,” Sue Rosser, provost emerita at San Francisco State, told AP News. But federal decisions have done exactly that.Over the past year alone, the Trump administration has slashed California’s research funding — jeopardising work on vaccines, dementia, women’s health, and LGBTQ+ issues, AP News reported. Undergraduate support programs have vanished. Most recently, hundreds of millions in UCLA grants were frozen amid a Justice Department probe, with the administration demanding a staggering $1 billion settlement before restoring the funds. A judge has forced some reinstatements, but the damage is already done.From women in STEM to “boys in crisis”Just a few years ago, women in STEM was the rallying cry. Today, the focus has drifted elsewhere. During the pandemic, many lawmakers and donors pivoted toward racial justice. And in July, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an executive order urging the state to address what he called a “growing crisis of connection and opportunity for men and boys.”His statement that “it’s not a zero-sum game” sounds conciliatory. But in practice, women’s programs have been first on the chopping block.The stakes are higher than numbersThe irony is glaring: while US tech and science industries face chronic worker shortages, half the population remains systematically sidelined. STEM jobs are not just well-paid — they are central to economic growth, global competitiveness, and even national security.California’s slow crawl toward equality in science and technology isn’t just a setback for women. It’s a failure for everyone.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future.

Trump targets racial preferences in college admissions but leaves legacy and donor advantages untouched
President Donald Trump’s campaign to overhaul college admissions emphasizes meritocracy, prioritizing test scores and eliminating racial considerations. Yet critics highlight a major blind spot: legacy admissions and donor-based preferences remain untouched, perpetuating inherited privilege. While the administration scrutinizes race, wealth-based advantages continue to shape opportunities, raising questions about the fairness and true merit of American higher education.

Yet critics highlight a major blind spot: legacy admissions and donor-based preferences remain untouched, perpetuating inherited privilege. While the administration scrutinizes race, wealth-based advantages continue to shape opportunities, raising questions about the fairness and true merit of American higher education.  President Donald Trump has launched an assertive campaign to reform college admissions, presenting it as a win for meritocracy. His policies focus on standardized test scores, academic achievement, and the elimination of racial considerations, portraying a vision of higher education driven solely by measurable performance. Yet, while race is under intense scrutiny, legacy admissions and donor-based advantages remain untouched, preserving a system that favors wealth and inherited privilege.Legacy admissions: The hidden advantage Legacy preferences, sometimes described as “affirmative action for the wealthy,” grant children of alumni or major donors a significant edge in admissions. Despite efforts to remove racial factors from evaluations, hereditary advantages continue to disproportionately benefit affluent and predominantly white students, leaving meritocracy incomplete.Political and legislative momentum Lawmakers argue that focusing solely on race does not fully address inequities in higher education. Several states, including Virginia, Colorado, and California, have banned legacy admissions at public institutions. Yet elite private universities, including all Ivy League schools, continue to uphold the practice. Stanford University recently announced it would maintain legacy preferences, even withdrawing from California’s state financial aid program rather than abandoning the policy.Merit over race, wealth intact Trump’s executive actions and Justice Department guidance aim to enforce compliance with the Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling against affirmative action, requiring universities to provide detailed admissions data. While the policies prohibit racial consideration, they make no mention of legacy or donor advantages. Critics argue this selective focus undermines the notion of merit, allowing inherited privilege to continue shaping opportunity.Public opinion and university practices Most Americans oppose legacy and donor preferences, according to a 2023 AP-NORC poll. Universities defend the practice as a means of building community and securing donations. Transparency, however, remains limited. While institutions report whether they consider legacy status, few disclose its impact on admissions. Among the nation’s most selective universities, very few reveal how many students are admitted under legacy or donor preference policies.Meritocracy under scrutinyTrump positions his actions as essential to maintaining meritocracy and ensuring colleges recruit capable future professionals. However, experts caution that targeting race alone may have unintended consequences, potentially prompting institutions to limit minority enrollment to avoid government scrutiny. The reform campaign raises fundamental questions about fairness in admissions when wealth and ancestry continue to hold sway.The road ahead Trump’s admissions initiative exposes the tension between merit, diversity, and tradition in higher education. By addressing racial considerations while leaving legacy privileges untouched, the policies challenge universities to reconcile fairness with entrenched advantages. Whether true meritocracy can flourish amid enduring wealth-based benefits remains uncertain, highlighting the complexity of reforming an institution long shaped by privilege.Ready to navigate global policies?

Visionaries like Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos are pioneering innovative, student-centered models, while global leaders such as Oprah Winfrey and Sunny Varkey expand access worldwide. These initiatives are redefining learning, preparing students for a rapidly changing, complex future.

Visionaries like Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos are pioneering innovative, student-centered models, while global leaders such as Oprah Winfrey and Sunny Varkey expand access worldwide. These initiatives are redefining learning, preparing students for a rapidly changing, complex future. Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg In an era where technology, globalization, and evolving job markets are rapidly reshaping the skills students need, traditional education often falls short. Classrooms bound by rigid curricula and standardized testing struggle to cultivate creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills essential for the 21st century. Recognizing this gap, billionaires are establishing schools that break away from convention, experimenting with student-centered learning, STEM-driven curricula, and holistic development. These initiatives are not mere acts of philanthropy; they are deliberate attempts to reinvent how education is delivered and to prepare students for an unpredictable, rapidly changing world.Elon Musk: Engineering curiosityElon Musk, the visionary behind Tesla and SpaceX, has long approached education with the same experimental mindset he applies to rockets and electric cars. He founded Ad Astra in California for his children and the children of SpaceX employees, a school that prioritized inquiry, project-based learning, and STEM excellence. This venture evolved into Astra Nova, an online platform designed to push the boundaries of student-led learning. In 2025, Musk expanded his vision with a private preschool in Bastrop, Texas, focused on nurturing curiosity and analytical skills from the earliest years. Backed by a $100 million foundation endowment, Musk’s schools are as much laboratories of innovation as they are institutions of learning.Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan: Holistic developmentMark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan approached education through a lens that marries academic rigor with personal well-being. Their Primary School, launched in 2016 via the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, integrated traditional instruction with health services, creating a learning environment attentive to both mind and body. Though slated to close after 2026, the school served as a bold experiment, demonstrating that educational success can stem from nurturing the whole child rather than focusing solely on grades.Jeff Bezos: Early learning, scaled for impactJeff Bezos has turned his attention to the youngest learners, establishing the Bezos Academy in 2020—a network of Montessori-inspired, tuition-free preschools serving under-resourced communities. Emphasizing hands-on exploration, social-emotional growth, and early STEM engagement, the initiative reflects a strategic vision: equitable access to quality education begins at the foundation level. Through the Bezos Day One Fund, these schools exemplify how targeted philanthropy can create sustainable, scalable impact.Global visionaries: Education without bordersThe movement transcends Silicon Valley. Oprah Winfrey founded the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa in 2007, offering gifted girls from disadvantaged backgrounds a world-class boarding education. Laurene Powell Jobs, via the XQ Institute, funds experimental high school projects across the United States, challenging traditional curricula and fostering innovation. Globally, entrepreneurs like Sunny Varkey (GEMS Education) and Bertil Hult (EF Education First) have built extensive networks of schools and programs, reaching hundreds of thousands of students and redefining what it means to educate at scale.Lessons for students and educatorsThese schools offer a critical insight: learning is evolving beyond rote memorization and standardization. For students, the emphasis on creativity, adaptability, and problem-solving provides a template for thriving in the modern world. For educators and policymakers, these initiatives offer blueprints for designing curricula that balance intellectual rigor with personal growth, preparing learners not just for exams, but for life.Shaping the classroom of tomorrowBy redefining what schooling can be, these billionaires are not merely funding institutions—they are shaping a vision of education for the 21st century. In classrooms where curiosity is currency and innovation is expected, students are learning to think differently, question assumptions, and embrace complexity. The lesson is clear: the future of education belongs to those bold enough to reimagine it.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future.

Despite competition from Rajinikanth's 'Coolie,' which initially led, 'War 2' saw a dip in collections after the initial surge.  Three powerhouse performers of the Indian entertainment industry joined hands for one of the biggest spy thrillers of 2025 - ‘War 2’. With the star power of Hrithik Roshan, Jr NTR, and Kiara Advani, the vision of director Ayaan Mukherji, and a gripping tale packed with high-octane action sequences, the movie became the talk of the town right from the word go. Released on August 14, the film did live up to the expectations with an impressive opening. However, after smashing collection on August 14 and 15, the movie’s business slowed down. Yet, as we speak, the movie has crossed the Rs. 150 crore mark.'War 2' box office collection day 4 updateReleased a day ahead of Indian Independence Day, ‘War 2’ opened with Rs 52 Cr across all languages in the domestic market, according to Sacnilk report. Released in Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu, the movie made Rs 29 Cr, Rs 0.25 Cr, and Rs 22.75 Cr, respectively. Thereafter, it benefited from the Independence Day festivities and earned Rs 57.35 Cr. If we break it down, then the film made Rs 44.5 Cr in Hindi, Rs 0.35 Cr in Tamil, and Rs 12.5 Cr in Telugu. However, from day 3, i.e., Saturday, the movies saw a drop in business. With a dip of more than 40 percent, it collected Rs. 33.25 Cr (rough data) across all languages. And on day 4 past noon, the movie has collected Rs. 8.89 Cr, taking the tally to Rs 151.58 Cr.Tough competition from Rajinikanth’s ‘Coolie’‘War 2’ isn’t the only big release that made it to the theatres this Friday; it clashed with Thalaviar’s action drama ‘Coolie.’ Trade reports show that on the opening day, with the collection of Rs. 65 Cr, ‘Coolie’ outshone ‘War 2,’ but on day 2, the latter had the last laugh. Nevertheless, on Saturday, the tables turned one more time, and despite a drop of around 29 percent, it collected Rs. 38.6 Cr. As we speak, it is still leading the race, with a business of Rs. 9.91 crore on Sunday, day 4, bringing its total to Rs. 168.26 crore.‘War 2’ Review“Hrithik Roshan brings gravitas to the screen as the roguish yet poised Kabir. He impresses as a high-octane action hero and in the film’s emotional moments. Junior NTR matches his energy and intensity, holding his own as a performer and in executing the action sequences. Kiara Advani makes her presence felt despite limited screen time, though the use of stunt doubles in an early fight scene is noticeable. Ashutosh Rana and Anil Kapoor are impactful in their roles,” reads an excerpt from TOI’s review of the movie'War 2' review: Stylish spy thriller with Hrithik–Jr NTR chemistry divides fans over story and VFX"Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Archana clarified that both her sons actually bear a strong resemblance to their father, Parmeet Sethi, ending the playful speculation. (Picture Courtesy: Facebook) Years ago, at a lively birthday celebration for Aryan Khan at Shah Rukh Khan’s iconic Mannat residence, Archana Puran Singh experienced a moment that would become one of her favourite anecdotes.As reported by NDTV, attending the party with her family, including her husband Parmeet Sethi and their young sons, Archana found herself in the middle of playful observations from two of Bollywood’s biggest stars.Shah Rukh Khan wins his first National Award; celebs and fans celebrate the long-overdue honour'His hair is exactly like mine' — Shah Rukh KhanArchana recalled that as soon as they arrived, Shah Rukh Khan met her son Ayushmann and immediately commented, “His hair is exactly like mine.” Without another word, SRK moved on to greet other guests, leaving Parmeet Sethi shooting his wife a curious, almost suspicious glance. The light-hearted moment didn’t end there. Moments later, Hrithik Roshan, also at the party, came up to Ayushmann, took a good look at him, and declared, “His eyes are exactly like mine.” Cue another pointed stare from Parmeet.Family resemblance wins in the endLaughing as she retold the story to Ajay Devgn and Mrunal Thakur, who were visiting her home during promotions for 'Son of Sardaar 2', Archana was quick to clarify that despite SRK’s and Hrithik’s observations, both her sons — Ayushmann and Aaryamann — actually resemble their father, Parmeet Sethi. “They both look exactly like him,” she said, putting the playful speculation to rest. Mrunal Thakur, hearing the tale for the first time, was left in stitches, while Ajay Devgn smiled knowingly at the familiar mix of celebrity banter and family pride.Meanwhile, 'Son of Sardaar 2' received mixed reviews from the audiences.

She calls it 'The Life of a Showgirl'. The singer revealed 'Portofino Orange' is the color of this era. She shared the album reflects her inner life during 'The Eras Tour'. Swift hinted at the new era with an orange door exit. Her bedazzled costumes represent life after the show.  Taylor Swift has been painting the world orange with ‘The Life of a Showgirl’ – and the fans are transforming to glitter from the grey-sepia tones. While the singer did confess that her life has been more ‘upbeat’ than the initial days of ‘The Eras Tour,’ the 35-year-old also remarked about why she chose orange from all the shade cards.Taylor Swift explains the reason behind the colorIn an appearance on the ‘New Heights’ podcast by the Kelce brothers, Swift announced 'Portofino Orange' as the official color for her new era. When Jason asked the reason, she said, “I’ve just always liked it, Jason. It feels like kind of energetically, how my life has felt.” “And this album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and vibrant,” she added, while Travis was gushing over her. Recalling a massive easter egg, the ‘Karma’ singer also pointed out that she exited the stage through an orange door at the last show, suggesting that she would be entering the new era. “I would leave the stage every night, going down the elevator lift. That’s how every single Eras Show ended, except for one, except for the last one, where I exited through a door, an orange door to be specific,” she said, adding that she was quite happy when her fans guessed the hint, “I was pretty happy that they noticed that. I was like, Trained them well."Taylor Swift opens up about the album cover and her bedazzled nightsMeanwhile, Taylor also revealed why she has all the bedazzled costumes for the new era, especially the album cover, where she is soaked in water with her jewels. While many fans connected the dots to the story of Ophelia, the character from Hamlet, Swift mentioned, “This represents the end of my night. My show days are the same every single day; I just have a different city. And my day ends with me in a bathtub – not usually in a bedazzled dress. [The album represents] the life beyond the show. I would say it’s everything that was going on behind the curtain,” she said in the interview.

Initially hesitant about Basanti's role after 'Seeta Aur Geeta', she agreed after Ramesh Sippy assured her of its impact. Despite Sholay's enduring popularity, her grandchildren haven't seen it, but she plans to show it to them now.  As Ramesh Sippy’s 'Sholay' completed 50 years on Friday, Hema Malini looked back on her experience of playing Basanti, one of Hindi cinema’s most iconic characters. Speaking to IANS, the actress revealed that during her prime years, filmmakers often wrote action sequences especially for her. “If Hema Malini is there in the film, we must make her fight; that was the sentiment,” she laughed. In Sholay, too, she was given memorable stunt sequences, particularly the now-legendary tanga chase where Basanti bravely drives the horse cart while dacoits pursue her. “Every scene in the film is a moving shot; nothing is static. That’s why the film still feels alive after all these years,” she reflected.Wanting more from Basanti at firstInterestingly, Hema admitted she wasn’t thrilled when Sippy first narrated Basanti’s role to her. Coming fresh off the blockbuster Seeta Aur Geeta, where she carried the film on her shoulders, she worried Basanti might be overshadowed. “I was disappointed at first. I thought, ‘Why such a small role for me when there are so many other characters?’” she recalled. It was only after Sippy assured her that Basanti’s character would leave a strong emotional and cinematic impact that she agreed. Today, Basanti’s witty, bold, and spirited presence is regarded as one of the most beloved parts of Sholay’s timeless ensemble.Introducing 'Sholay' to the next generationEven as audiences continue to celebrate 'Sholay' half a century later, Hema Malini admitted her grandchildren haven’t seen the film yet. “I don’t think so,” she said.The actress concluded by saying, “But now that it has completed fifty years, I will show it to them. I’ll make them sit with me in my mini theater at home and watch it together.”Janmashtami 2025: Hema Malini Celebrates Krishna’s Birth, Sends Devotional Wishes To Fans"Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Aryan's voiceover, reminiscent of Shah Rukh Khan, promises a playful critique of the industry.  Aryan Khan has finally unveiled the much-anticipated first look of his debut web series, 'Ba***ds of Bollywood,' and it is everything fans expected—stylish, satirical, and soaked in cinema.The teaser opens with the iconic violin tune from 'Mohabbatein.' This instantly reminds viewers of Shah Rukh Khan’s romantic legacy. But just as the nostalgia sets in, Aryan flips the narrative. Unlike his father, who made audiences swoon with tales of pyaar, Aryan speaks of vaar—an attack, a cheeky jab at the industry he is also celebrating. His voiceover, eerily reminiscent of SRK’s, guides viewers through a montage that mixes dreamy romance with chaotic action, giving a taste of what’s to come.Netizens' reaction on B***ds of BollywoodViewers seem to be highly impressed. One comment read, "Aryan's acting, dialog delivery." Another comment read, "Aryan's acting, dialogue delivery, and screen presence are brilliant!" A third one commented, "Aryan has the potential to continue his father's legacy!! SRK's son."All about B***ds of Bollywood —Love, action, and satireThe series stars Lakshya and Sahher Bambba in leading roles, whose chemistry is showcased in the teaser with textbook Bollywood romance shots. Yet, just when the mood feels familiar, the screen bursts into high-octane sequences—fights, bloodied faces, and larger-than-life drama. Aryan’s narration: “Bollywood—jisse aapne saalon se pyaar bhi kiya aur vaar bhi kiya, main bhi wohi karunga. Bohot saara pyaar… aur thoda sa vaar.” (You have loved Bollywood and attacked it too. I’ll do the same—a lot of love, with a little attack—showing a playful balance of affection and critique. This is what makes the project intriguing.A star-studded ensembleAryan isn’t going solo in this venture. Alongside Lakshya and Sahher, the series boasts a powerhouse ensemble including Bobby Deol, Mona Singh, Manoj Pahwa, Manish Chaudhari, Raghav Juyal, Gautami Kapoor, Vijayant Kohli, and Anya Singh.The glimpse suggests the series isn’t just another glossy web drama but a stylized satire that holds up a mirror to Bollywood itself.Aryan Khan Has An Announcement For You 📢 | First Look | The Ba***ds of Bollywood | Netflix IndiaSalman sings 'Saare Jahan Se Accha' while SRK and AbRam post picture with TricolourAbout the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

In this, it made Rs 29 Cr in Hindi, Rs 0.25 Cr in Tamil, and Rs 22.75 Cr in Telugu. Thereafter, on Independence Day, the movie witnessed a growth of around 10 percent, and the business went up to Rs 57.35 Cr, in which the collection from Hindi was Rs 44.5 Cr, Tamil Rs 0.35 Cr, and Telugu Rs 12.5 Cr. However, on Saturday, the movies couldn’t enjoy the weekend and festive surge of Janmashtami, as the collection went down to Rs. 33 Cr (early estimates) across all languages in India. With this, the total collection of ‘War 2’ after 3 days stands at Rs. 142.35 Cr. At this pace, the movie is expected to cross Rs. 150 cr with ease and create a new record. Competition from Rajinikanth’s ‘Coolie’Thalaviar’s action drama surpassed the collection of ‘War 2’ on day 1. Though the censor board gave the movie an 'A' certificate, it made Rs. 65 Cr on its opening Friday. The collection came from Hindi, Tamil, and Kannada versions of the movies. Elated fans turned theatres into a celebration ground as the movie made it to the 70mm. However, on day 2, it was outperformed by the Hrithik Roshan and Jr. NTR starrer and made Rs. 54.75 CR. On Saturday, just like ‘War 2’, the movie witnessed a major drop, yet it collected Rs. 38.50 Cr, and took the lead in the box office race. As of now, the movie has made Rs. 158.25 Cr in the domestic market.It would be interesting to see how the box office dynamic changes in the coming days, and which movie benefits the maximum from the weekend surge‘War 2’ ReviewWith a rating of 3 stars from TOI critics, excerpts from our review of the movie read - “Hrithik Roshan brings gravitas to the screen as the roguish yet poised Kabir. He impresses as a high-octane action hero and in the film’s emotional moments. Junior NTR matches his energy and intensity, holding his own as a performer and in executing the action sequences. Kiara Advani makes her presence felt despite limited screen time, though the use of stunt doubles in an early fight scene is noticeable. Ashutosh Rana and Anil Kapoor are impactful in their roles.War 2 offers high-octane moments, striking visuals, and polished production to make for a passable big-screen experience. Strictly watchable only if you’re in it purely for the action and spectacle.”The chemistry between not just Hrithik and Kiara, but Hrithik and Jr. NTR is also being lauded. Besides their performance, their respective looks is being appreciated, for which each one of them followed a strict regime.War 2 - Dialogue Promo (Hindi)DISCLAIMER: The box office numbers in this article are compiled from our proprietary sources and diverse public data.

When Saif broke his silence on 'Devdas' casting
Sanjay Leela Bhansali initially considered Saif Ali Khan for the role of Chunilal in 'Devdas,' alongside Shah Rukh Khan as Devdas. Saif clarified that he didn't reject the offer but there was a miscommunication regarding his fees. He also expressed reservations about being the right fit for the character, ultimately feeling miscast for the part.

Saif clarified that he didn't reject the offer but there was a miscommunication regarding his fees. He also expressed reservations about being the right fit for the character, ultimately feeling miscast for the part.  Back in the early 2000s, Sanjay Leela Bhansali was assembling his dream cast for 'Devdas', his grand adaptation of Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay’s timeless novel.While Shah Rukh Khan was always the first choice to play Devdas, Sanjay Leela Bhansali had initially considered Saif Ali Khan for the role of Chunilal, Devdas’ loyal yet flawed friend. However, the collaboration never materialised, and the part eventually went to Jackie Shroff.Setting the record straight in a 2001 interview with journalist Nilufer Qureshi, Saif clarified that, contrary to rumours, he never turned down the offer. “Though Sanjay Bhansali thinks I’m silly, let me make it very clear that I didn’t turn him down. There was a miscommunication between us on the price. Also, let me clarify that I didn’t ask for an obscene sum of money,” he said.‘Hopelessly miscast’ — Why Saif felt the role wasn’t hisInterestingly, even though he was considered for Chunilal, Saif admitted he wasn’t convinced he was right for the part. “I felt I’d be hopelessly miscast as Chunilal. I didn’t think the role suited Motilal either in Bimal Roy’s Devdas. But at least, Motilal and Chunilal rhyme,” he quipped with humour. His words reflected both honesty and self-awareness about his craft at a time when he was still shaping his career in mainstream cinema.Kareena Kapoor, Soha Ali Khan & Saba Pen Emotional Wishes For Sara’s Big Day"Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

While Jenna Ortega's portrayal of Wednesday Addams has garnered significant attention, Catherine Zeta-Jones, as Morticia Addams, holds the highest net worth at USD 150 million. The season premiered in August 2025, with the concluding episodes set to release in September.  The gothic drama, ‘Wednesday,’ has taken over the playlists, social media, and gossip sessions with the highly anticipated Season 2 – and the fans can’t get enough of it. While the cast members played their same characters this season as well, their net worths have a stark difference. Here’s a closer look at the net worth of the ‘Wednesday’ star cast, with one person holding the crown of being the richest – and it’s not Jenna Ortega.Hunter Doohan (Tyler Gaplin)From being a boy-next-door barista to a sinister monster, Hunter Doohan copiously played the role of Tyler Gaplin in ‘Wednesday.’ He earned his way up by working in numerous short films and minor roles in television roles such as ‘What If’ and ‘Westworld.’ Taking a significant leap, the 31-year-old recently joined Marvel for the ‘Daredevil: Born Again’ series, and worked in prominent dramas such as ‘Truth Be Told’ and ‘Your Honor.’ Holding an estimated net worth of USD 400,000, Doohan created a stunning impact in ‘Wednesday Season 2,' according to The Richest.Jenna Ortega (Wednesday Addams)The modern Wednesday Addams screams ancestral trauma and goth, and Jenna Ortega played the titular role quite commendably. She gained recognition by playing minor characters in ‘Jane the Virgin’ and ‘You.’ After her breakout in season 1, the 22-year-old played the lead roles in feature films, including ‘Miller’s Girl,’ ‘Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,’ and ‘Hurry Up Tomorrow.’ Holding an estimated net worth of USD 5 million, Ortega’s character brought the horror back to Nevermore Academy. Billie Piper (Isadora Capri)Billie Piper brought Isadora Capri to life with her successful music career and talented artistic instincts. Playing the role of the school’s new Head of Music, she added just the drama needed in the supernatural series. The 42-year-old rose to fame after her role in ‘Doctor Who,’ leading to even more success as the lead role in ‘I Hate Suzie’ and ‘Penny Dreadful.’ Holding an estimated net worth of USD 12 million, Piper helmed her dual expertise to triumph. Luiz Guzman (Gomez Addams)Luiz Guzman, playing the iconic role of Gomez Addams, returned to ‘Wednesday Season 2’ with an even darker narrative and challenging devotion. He has been in the industry for four decades, achieving a new peak of success with each project. The 68-year-old’s prominent and memorable showbiz includes ‘Narcos,’ ‘Code Black,’ ‘Out of Sight,’ and many more. Holding an estimated net worth of USD 13 million, Guzman gave a new form of yearning in the new season.Steve Buscemi (Barry Dot)The new principal, Barry Dot, played by none other than Steve Buscemi, added all the deserving twists and energy in ‘Wednesday.’ He is renowned for playing characters with unprecedented future and actions throughout the course. After being in the entertainment industry for four decades, the 67-year-old went from being a firefighter to a full-time actor. Buscemi earned recognition after his role in ‘Reservoir Dogs,’ leading to further success in feature films, including ‘The Death of Stalin,’ ‘Fargo,’ ‘Ghost World,’ and many more. Holding an estimated net worth of USD 35 million, Buscemi brought a certain new light to the darker mix in the new season. Catherine Zeta-Jones (Morticia Addams)Catherine Zeta-Jones, in the stunning attire of Morticia Addams, casually turned dread into a romantic emotion. The actress is renowned for turning people’s heads in the industry, and she continues to do so with her innate charm. The 55-year-old’s significant projects include ‘No Reservations,’ ‘Ocean’s Twelve,’ ‘The Terminal,’ and many more. Holding the crown of being the richest cast member, Catherine Zeta-Jones has an estimated net worth of USD 150 million. ‘Wednesday Season 2: Part 1’ was released on August 2, 2025, on Netflix, and the defining two episodes under ‘Part 2’ would be released on September 3, 2025.

Khan, known for his wit, diffused the situation with a clever remark about the producer's cunning.  Veteran actor Kader Khan, remembered for his razor-sharp dialogues and unforgettable screen presence, continues to live in the memories of his co-stars and fans. In a recent interview, actor Tiku Talsania opened up about a touching yet humorous incident from the sets of 'Umar 55 Ki Dil Bachpan Ka'. His recollection once again highlighted why Kader Khan was considered one of the finest minds in Hindi cinema.A producer’s desperate pleaIn an interview with Friday Talkies, Tiku Talsania shared that during the shoot of the film, a producer once approached Kader Khan with folded hands and literally sat near his feet, begging him to finish his dubbing. “The producer told him, ‘Sir, please complete my film, otherwise main footpath pe aa jaunga (I’ll end up on the streets),’” Talsania recalled. For Tiku, the scene was both emotional and awkward. But with Kader Khan's trademark wit, he turned the moment into something unforgettable.Kader Khan’s witty replyInstead of being overwhelmed, Kader Khan quickly responded with a punch line that perfectly summed up his sharp humor. He quipped that the producer is so cunning that he would even sell the footpath if needed. This left everyone around stunned and laughing. Tiku added, “He had a way with words; his lines carried both weight and wit.” For those who worked with him, this was just another example of how Kader Khan could diffuse tension with his spontaneous brilliance.From professor to film legendBefore he became a household name with his films, Kader Khan was a civil engineering professor, teaching applied mathematics and mechanics. His journey to cinema began when acting legend Dilip Kumar spotted him during a stage play. Dilip encouraged him to write and act for films. What followed was an extraordinary career spanning 47 years, during which he wrote dialogues for nearly 200 films and acted in about 300.Kader Khan alive, death rumours a hoax"Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
