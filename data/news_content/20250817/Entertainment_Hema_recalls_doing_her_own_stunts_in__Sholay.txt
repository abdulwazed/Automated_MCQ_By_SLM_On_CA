Initially hesitant about Basanti's role after 'Seeta Aur Geeta', she agreed after Ramesh Sippy assured her of its impact. Despite Sholay's enduring popularity, her grandchildren haven't seen it, but she plans to show it to them now.  As Ramesh Sippy’s 'Sholay' completed 50 years on Friday, Hema Malini looked back on her experience of playing Basanti, one of Hindi cinema’s most iconic characters. Speaking to IANS, the actress revealed that during her prime years, filmmakers often wrote action sequences especially for her. “If Hema Malini is there in the film, we must make her fight; that was the sentiment,” she laughed. In Sholay, too, she was given memorable stunt sequences, particularly the now-legendary tanga chase where Basanti bravely drives the horse cart while dacoits pursue her. “Every scene in the film is a moving shot; nothing is static. That’s why the film still feels alive after all these years,” she reflected.Wanting more from Basanti at firstInterestingly, Hema admitted she wasn’t thrilled when Sippy first narrated Basanti’s role to her. Coming fresh off the blockbuster Seeta Aur Geeta, where she carried the film on her shoulders, she worried Basanti might be overshadowed. “I was disappointed at first. I thought, ‘Why such a small role for me when there are so many other characters?’” she recalled. It was only after Sippy assured her that Basanti’s character would leave a strong emotional and cinematic impact that she agreed. Today, Basanti’s witty, bold, and spirited presence is regarded as one of the most beloved parts of Sholay’s timeless ensemble.Introducing 'Sholay' to the next generationEven as audiences continue to celebrate 'Sholay' half a century later, Hema Malini admitted her grandchildren haven’t seen the film yet. “I don’t think so,” she said.The actress concluded by saying, “But now that it has completed fifty years, I will show it to them. I’ll make them sit with me in my mini theater at home and watch it together.”Janmashtami 2025: Hema Malini Celebrates Krishna’s Birth, Sends Devotional Wishes To Fans"Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
