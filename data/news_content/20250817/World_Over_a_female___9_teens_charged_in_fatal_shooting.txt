The incident occurred after an argument reportedly over a girl. Devan Scott Raper, 19, is accused of fatally shooting Trey Dean Wright. Wright's girlfriend and others are charged as accessories. The investigation revealed that at least one person recorded the killing. . Nine teenagers in South Carolina have been arrested in connection with the death of a 16-year-old boy, which reportedly stemmed from an argument “over a girl” with the alleged gunman, as per local reports. Among those charged is the victim’s 17-year-old girlfriend.Trey Dean Wright, 16, was found fatally shot on June 24, with multiple gunshot wounds, on First Neck Road in Florence County, about 45 miles (approximately 72 km) west of Myrtle Beach, reported Fox News. Deputies arrested 19-year-old Devan Scott Raper of Conway the next day, who is accused of fatally shooting Wright after an argument. At least one teenager allegedly recorded the killing on video, and additional arrests were made in the following weeks as the investigation unfolded."All this court hearing and bond court and stuff is driving me crazy," Ashley Lindsey, Wright’s mother, was quoted as saying by Fox News. "I don't even have time to sit down and think half the time, on top of losing my precious baby."Wright’s 17-year-old girlfriend, Giann Kistenmacher, faces charges as an accessory before the fact for allegedly bringing Raper to meet Wright despite knowing he was armed.Also charged in connection with the setup were 18-year-olds Corrine Belviso and Hunter Kendall, along with 17-year-old Sydney Kearns. Online jail records show Kendall has been in custody since July 31, while Belviso was arrested on Tuesday and Kearns on Monday.Kendall and Belviso are scheduled to appear in Florence County Circuit Court on September 17, while no court date has been listed for Kearns.Details about the four additional suspects have not been released because they are minors, said authorities. “They were complicit in bringing the armed codefendant, Raper to the incident location and knowing that there would be a confrontation,” Maj. Michael Nunn of the Florence County sheriff’s office was quoted as saying by WBTW-TV. “They knew that Raper had presented a firearm to the victim and made threats to shoot him, according to the arrest warrants,” he said. The fatal shooting seemed to have stemmed from an argument tied to a romantic rivalry. "They had issues with each other, and it was over a female," sheriff T.J. Joye was quoted as saying by WBTW-TV.  "The sad thing is, you got a 16-year-old that lost his life. You’ve got a 19-year-old who is going to be in jail the rest of his life. Over what?"Raper has been charged with murder and possession of a weapon during a violent crime and is currently being held without bond.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
