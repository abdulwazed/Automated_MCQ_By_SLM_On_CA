I asked him what kind of meat is available here. He told me about the different kinds of meat. Then I asked if dog meat was available. Afridi was sitting right there. Razzaq was shocked to hear this and said, 'Hey Irfan, why are you saying this?'" Pathan said on Lallantop.PollDo you believe that verbal exchanges in sports can impact performance?Yes, they can motivate playersNo, they are just distractionsIt depends on the player"I said, 'He (Afridi) has eaten dog meat, he has been barking for a long time.'"After that, Afridi couldn’t say anything. Whatever he might have said, I would have just replied, 'Look, he is barking again.' After this, he remained silent throughout the flight."From this incident, he understood that he could not win against me verbally. That’s why he never said anything to me again," he added.Pathan, who had immense success against Pakistan in his career — taking 67 wickets and scoring 807 runs, including a century — revealed what led to the verbal altercation."Afridi came and placed his hand on my head, messing up my hair. He asked me, 'How are you, kid?' I said, 'Since when have you become my father?' The childish behaviour was actually his. He was not my friend. After that, Afridi said some abusive words to me. His seat was right next to mine," he recollected.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
