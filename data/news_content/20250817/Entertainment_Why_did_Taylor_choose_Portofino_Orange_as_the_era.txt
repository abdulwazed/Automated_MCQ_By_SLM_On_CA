She calls it 'The Life of a Showgirl'. The singer revealed 'Portofino Orange' is the color of this era. She shared the album reflects her inner life during 'The Eras Tour'. Swift hinted at the new era with an orange door exit. Her bedazzled costumes represent life after the show.  Taylor Swift has been painting the world orange with ‘The Life of a Showgirl’ – and the fans are transforming to glitter from the grey-sepia tones. While the singer did confess that her life has been more ‘upbeat’ than the initial days of ‘The Eras Tour,’ the 35-year-old also remarked about why she chose orange from all the shade cards.Taylor Swift explains the reason behind the colorIn an appearance on the ‘New Heights’ podcast by the Kelce brothers, Swift announced 'Portofino Orange' as the official color for her new era. When Jason asked the reason, she said, “I’ve just always liked it, Jason. It feels like kind of energetically, how my life has felt.” “And this album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and vibrant,” she added, while Travis was gushing over her. Recalling a massive easter egg, the ‘Karma’ singer also pointed out that she exited the stage through an orange door at the last show, suggesting that she would be entering the new era. “I would leave the stage every night, going down the elevator lift. That’s how every single Eras Show ended, except for one, except for the last one, where I exited through a door, an orange door to be specific,” she said, adding that she was quite happy when her fans guessed the hint, “I was pretty happy that they noticed that. I was like, Trained them well."Taylor Swift opens up about the album cover and her bedazzled nightsMeanwhile, Taylor also revealed why she has all the bedazzled costumes for the new era, especially the album cover, where she is soaked in water with her jewels. While many fans connected the dots to the story of Ophelia, the character from Hamlet, Swift mentioned, “This represents the end of my night. My show days are the same every single day; I just have a different city. And my day ends with me in a bathtub – not usually in a bedazzled dress. [The album represents] the life beyond the show. I would say it’s everything that was going on behind the curtain,” she said in the interview.
