Lionel Messi marked his return for Inter Miami with a stunning goal and an incredible assist (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky) Lionel Messi marked his return from injury with a game-winning display, scoring one and setting up another as Inter Miami beat LA Galaxy 3-1 on Saturday night. The Argentine, back after missing two matches with a hamstring issue, came off the bench at halftime and made sure that his team took home all three points. Messi’s breakthrough arrived in the 84th minute when he weaved through defenders and fired a classic left-footed strike from distance to make it 2-1. Moments later, he produced the night’s highlight, a clever back-heel assist, setting up Luis Suárez for Miami's third and final goal of the night.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

The goal saw him take on two defenders before comfortably slotting his shot into the bottom left corner past Novak Micovic. Coach Javier Mascherano admitted the staff would monitor Messi’s recovery closely after he appeared to stretch his leg at times. “The important thing is that he finished (the match),” Mascherano said as quoted by AP. He noted the forward grew more comfortable as the game went on. Earlier, Jordi Alba had given Miami the lead before Galaxy’s Joseph Paintsil equalised in the second half. Messi’s late moment of brilliance ensured there was no slip-up this time, with his quality once again making the difference.PollWhat do you think was the highlight of Messi's performance against LA Galaxy?His game-winning goalThe back-heel assist The victory comes ahead of Miami’s clash against Tigres UANL in the Leagues Cup on Wednesday.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
