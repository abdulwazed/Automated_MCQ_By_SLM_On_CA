After President Donald Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska Friday, eight pages of a document which was supposed to be secret, were found at the business center of an Alaskan hotel -- possibly left behind by the US team by mistake. NPR reported about the papers adding that it's not known whether they were authentic documents but they included US State Department markings and were found on a public printer. The hotel is about 20 minutes away from where Putin and Trump convened at the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, NPR reported.The documents revealed that Trump intended to gift Putin an "American Bald Eagle Desk Statue" and it's not known whether it was gifted to him. The document shared precise locations and meeting time schedules along with the phone numbers of US government employees. The document listed the names of Russian leaders with phonetic spellings, making Putin "Mr President Poo-tihn", NPR reported. NPR posted a menu that included a “green salad” with “champagne vinaigrette” paired with surf and turf consisting of a filet mignon with “brandy peppercorn sauce” and “buttery whipped potatoes and roasted asparagus” with halibut, a fish found in Russia’s arctic waters.For something sweet, crème brûlée was reportedly planned for dessert. But the lunch was for some reason called off.A seating chart shows that Putin and Trump were supposed to sit across from each other during the luncheon. Trump would be flanked by six officials: Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles to his right, and Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and Special Envoy for Peace Missions Steve Witkoff to his left.White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly dismissed the papers as a "multi-page lunch menu" and suggested leaving the information on a public printer was not a security breach.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
