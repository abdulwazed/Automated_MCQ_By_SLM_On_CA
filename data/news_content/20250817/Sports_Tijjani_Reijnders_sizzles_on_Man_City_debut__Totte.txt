Erling Haaland and Richarlison (Images via Getty Images) Manchester City began their Premier League campaign in emphatic fashion, crushing Wolves 4-0 at Molineux on Saturday, as newcomers Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki made instant impacts. Reijnders, a summer signing from AC Milan, was involved in three of the goals, showcasing the creativity Pep Guardiola wanted in order to replace Kevin De Bruyne. The Dutch midfielder assisted Erling Haaland’s opener with a cheeky flick in the 34th minute, before scoring himself three minutes later with an accurate strike into the bottom corner.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

France international Cherki added the finishing touch, curling home from distance soon after coming on as a substitute. Tottenham also impressed, easing past Burnley 3-0 at home. Richarlison struck twice, both set up by Mohammed Kudus from the right flank, including a spectacular scissor kick for his second. Brennan Johnson added a third from Pape Sarr’s through ball to secure a comfortable win for last season’s Europa League champions. At Villa Park, Newcastle failed to take advantage of their dominance in a goalless draw against Aston Villa. Without striker Alexander Isak, who continues to push for a move away, the visitors lacked a cutting edge. New signing Anthony Elanga looked lively, but Villa held firm despite being reduced to 10 men when Ezri Konsa was dismissed for denying a goalscoring chance. Promoted Sunderland stunned West Ham with a 3-0 victory at home. Eliezer Mayenda and Dan Ballard both scored headers in the second half before Wilson Isidor sealed the result in stoppage time. Brighton looked set for three points when Matt O’Riley converted a penalty in the 55th minute after Sander Berge fouled Georginio Rutter. But deep into added time, Fulham snatched a draw as Rodrigo Muniz pounced on a corner to equalize in the 96th minute. Earlier in the day, the Premier League held moments of silence and applause across grounds in memory of Diogo Jota, the former Liverpool and Wolves forward who recently died in a car crash alongside his brother. Wolves fans displayed a large tifo and chanted his name in the 18th minute, honoring the number he wore for the club.PollWhich player had the biggest impact in Manchester City's victory over Wolves?Tijjani ReijndersErling HaalandRayan CherkiSomeone else The tributes followed Friday’s emotional scenes at Anfield, where Liverpool supporters remembered Jota in the club's 4-2 win over Bournemouth.
