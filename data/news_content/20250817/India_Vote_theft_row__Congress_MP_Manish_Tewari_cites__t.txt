Congress MP Manish Tewari cites ‘trust deficit’ with Election Commission; Akhilesh Yadav presses for reforms (Picture credit: PTI, ANI) NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India (ECI) is facing mounting criticism from opposition parties, with Congress MP Manish Tewari and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav both questioning the poll body’s credibility in light of allegations over voter list manipulation.As per news agency ANI, Tewari said the Commission was struggling with a “trust deficit,” arguing that it carried “very little conviction” and “almost zero credibility” among political circles and the wider public. Objecting to the current system of appointments for the Chief Election Commissioner and Election Commissioners, he stressed that the executive’s “veto” in the process was undermining confidence. “As long as the executive veto remains with regard to the appointment of the Commissioners of the EC, no matter how many press conferences the EC does it will not matter even one bit whatsoever,” he wrote on X.He further urged the poll body to “correct the widely held perception that it is an extension counter of the Union Government,” warning that it had acquired a negative label similar to “Godi Media,” which, he said, was harmful for Indian democracy.Meanwhile, Samajwadi Party’s leader Akhilesh Yadav also targeted the Commission, saying it needed “not just reform but an inevitable fundamental transformation.” In a post shared on X, Yadav stated, “The historic responsibility of saving democracy rests on their shoulders. It is understood that they are under various kinds of undesirable pressures, but they should not think they are alone. When the Election Commission starts walking on the right path, the support of millions of Indians will become its protective shield. The public and public trust naturally align with those who walk the path of truth.”He added that even one “courageous step” by the Commission could safeguard the future of generations.Yadav’s comments came as opposition parties raised objections to the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of voter rolls in Bihar. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had earlier alleged voter list manipulation and produced what he called “proof” at a press conference. The Commission, in response, has asked Gandhi to provide a signed affidavit and submit the evidence formally for investigation.RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav also joined the criticism, accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party of “misusing Constitutional agencies” and attempting to “destroy democracy and the Constitution.” He vowed to resist any effort to deny people their voting rights, saying, “We will fight wherever we want and we will not let our rights be erased.”The Election Commission, however, defended its procedures, stating that errors in electoral rolls should be raised during the “Claims and Objections” period. According to the Commission, digital and physical copies of the final roll are shared with recognised political parties and candidates to ensure scrutiny at the right time. “Had these issues been raised at the right time through the right channels, it would have enabled the concerned SDM EROs to correct the mistakes, if genuine, before those elections,” the EC said in its release.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
