In a light-hearted discussion, Tufnell said Russell would deliberately avoid brushing his teeth for a couple of days before a match. “My wicketkeeper, Jack Russell, didn’t use to brush his teeth for a couple of days. He said he wanted to put the batters off when he was standing up to the crease. Lots of little shenanigans go on there,” Tufnell revealed on BBC, leaving listeners amused at the extent wicketkeepers sometimes go to in order to gain an edge.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! The role of a wicketkeeper has often extended beyond just their skills with the gloves.

But as a bowler, you just love it. It brings a different energy. When you have a quiet keeper, it feels like the game takes so long,” Brathwaite said, pointing to how a vocal presence can lift a bowling side’s intensity.PollHow important is a wicketkeeper's chatter behind the stumps?Essential for team moraleHelpful but not crucialNot important at all From playful banter to strange personal routines, wicketkeepers often find their own ways to get under a batter’s skin and keep their teammates engaged.
