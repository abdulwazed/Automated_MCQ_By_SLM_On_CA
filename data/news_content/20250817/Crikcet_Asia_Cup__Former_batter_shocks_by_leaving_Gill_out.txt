Shubman Gill NEW DELHI: With the Indian selectors set to announce the Asia Cup 2025 squad on Tuesday, August 19, former India batter Mohammad Kaif has created a stir with his own team prediction. Sharing his thoughts on his YouTube channel, Kaif made a surprising call by including Test captain Shubman Gill in the 15-member squad but leaving him out of the playing XI.Shubman Gill blames 'judgement error' as Rishabh Pant run-out haunts India in Lord’s heartbreakGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Gill, who has been one of India’s most consistent batters across formats in recent years, finds himself on the bench in Kaif’s set-up. Instead, Kaif backed Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma as his opening pair, with Tilak Varma slotted at No. 3. India’s T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav was Kaif’s choice to lead the side, with Axar Patel named as vice-captain — another unusual pick that sparked debate among fans.PollDo you agree with Mohammad Kaif's decision to leave Shubman Gill out of the playing XI for the Asia Cup?Yes, it was a good callNo, Gill should be in the XIKaif’s middle and lower order featured Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Washington Sundar, and Kuldeep Yadav, while the pace attack was led by Jasprit Bumrah, supported by Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Siraj. For the bench, Kaif listed Gill, Siraj, Jitesh Sharma, and Varun Chakaravarthy, meaning the Test captain, Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy’s star pacer, a wicketkeeper-batter, and a mystery spinner all missed out from his preferred XI.Kaif justified his bold selection by stressing the need for balance and versatility in the shortest format, highlighting Samson’s attacking ability at the top and Abhishek’s recent all-round performances. His choices, however, have already triggered strong reactions, particularly given Gill’s stature and recent form.As the Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee finalises its squad, all eyes will be on whether Gill not only makes the cut but also secures vice-captaincy in India’s squad for the Asia Cup.Kaif's India squad for Asia CupSanju Samson, Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma, Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Shubman Gill, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Varun Chakaravarthy, Jitesh Sharma and Mohammed Siraj.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
