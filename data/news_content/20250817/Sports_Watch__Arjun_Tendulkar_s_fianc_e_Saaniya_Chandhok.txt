Arjun Tendulkar’s fiancée Saaniya Chandhok with future sister-in-law Sara Tendulkar in an old video (Screengrab via Instagram/@saratendulkar) A resurfaced social media post has offered a glimpse into the long-standing friendship between Sara Tendulkar and Saaniya Chandok, who is now engaged to Sara’s brother, Arjun Tendulkar. The video, shared by Sara in October 2024, appears to be from a girls’ trip. Captioned “table for three”, it features Sara, Saaniya and a friend showing off their outfits and enjoying different locations. The clip, now in the spotlight after the news of Saaniya's engagement with Arjun Tendulkar, highlights how close Saaniya has been to the Tendulkar family long before her engagement. That bond has now taken on a new meaning, with Arjun Tendulkar and Saaniya Chandok formalising their relationship earlier this week. The 25-year-old cricketer, son of Sachin Tendulkar, got engaged to 26-year-old Saaniya on August 13 in a private ceremony attended by close friends and family. Saaniya, the granddaughter of businessman Ravi Ghai, comes from a family deeply connected to India’s food and hospitality industry. The Ghai family runs the Graviss Group, which manages Baskin Robbins’ India operations and owns The Brooklyn Creamery. Graviss Food Solutions Private Limited reported ₹624 crore in revenue for FY23-24. Fans have also been given a rare look at the Tendulkars’ personal celebrations through recent Instagram photos. The images show Sachin Tendulkar performing a pooja alongside his wife Anjali, daughter Sara, son Arjun and future daughter-in-law Saaniya. The intimate family gathering, has further showcased the growing bond between the two families. Sara recently launched a pilates academy in Andheri, Mumbai.  The age gap between Arjun and Saaniya, a little over a year, has already drawn attention online, drawing comparisons to Sachin Tendulkar’s own marriage. The cricket icon married Anjali in 1995 despite her being five years older.PollDo you believe age differences matter in relationships?Yes, they can be significantNo, it doesn't matterIt depends on the individuals For now, though, the focus remains on the Tendulkars’ newest chapter. From old trip videos to quiet family rituals, glimpses of Arjun and Saaniya’s journey together are steadily emerging, and cricket fans are taking note.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
