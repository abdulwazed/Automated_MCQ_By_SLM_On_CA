Despite competition from Rajinikanth's 'Coolie,' which initially led, 'War 2' saw a dip in collections after the initial surge.  Three powerhouse performers of the Indian entertainment industry joined hands for one of the biggest spy thrillers of 2025 - ‘War 2’. With the star power of Hrithik Roshan, Jr NTR, and Kiara Advani, the vision of director Ayaan Mukherji, and a gripping tale packed with high-octane action sequences, the movie became the talk of the town right from the word go. Released on August 14, the film did live up to the expectations with an impressive opening. However, after smashing collection on August 14 and 15, the movie’s business slowed down. Yet, as we speak, the movie has crossed the Rs. 150 crore mark.'War 2' box office collection day 4 updateReleased a day ahead of Indian Independence Day, ‘War 2’ opened with Rs 52 Cr across all languages in the domestic market, according to Sacnilk report. Released in Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu, the movie made Rs 29 Cr, Rs 0.25 Cr, and Rs 22.75 Cr, respectively. Thereafter, it benefited from the Independence Day festivities and earned Rs 57.35 Cr. If we break it down, then the film made Rs 44.5 Cr in Hindi, Rs 0.35 Cr in Tamil, and Rs 12.5 Cr in Telugu. However, from day 3, i.e., Saturday, the movies saw a drop in business. With a dip of more than 40 percent, it collected Rs. 33.25 Cr (rough data) across all languages. And on day 4 past noon, the movie has collected Rs. 8.89 Cr, taking the tally to Rs 151.58 Cr.Tough competition from Rajinikanth’s ‘Coolie’‘War 2’ isn’t the only big release that made it to the theatres this Friday; it clashed with Thalaviar’s action drama ‘Coolie.’ Trade reports show that on the opening day, with the collection of Rs. 65 Cr, ‘Coolie’ outshone ‘War 2,’ but on day 2, the latter had the last laugh. Nevertheless, on Saturday, the tables turned one more time, and despite a drop of around 29 percent, it collected Rs. 38.6 Cr. As we speak, it is still leading the race, with a business of Rs. 9.91 crore on Sunday, day 4, bringing its total to Rs. 168.26 crore.‘War 2’ Review“Hrithik Roshan brings gravitas to the screen as the roguish yet poised Kabir. He impresses as a high-octane action hero and in the film’s emotional moments. Junior NTR matches his energy and intensity, holding his own as a performer and in executing the action sequences. Kiara Advani makes her presence felt despite limited screen time, though the use of stunt doubles in an early fight scene is noticeable. Ashutosh Rana and Anil Kapoor are impactful in their roles,” reads an excerpt from TOI’s review of the movie'War 2' review: Stylish spy thriller with Hrithik–Jr NTR chemistry divides fans over story and VFX"Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
