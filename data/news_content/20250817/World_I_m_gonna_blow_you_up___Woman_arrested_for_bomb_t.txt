She also sent a barrage of incoherent texts and photos to a UCF professor. AI Image used for representative purpose A Florida woman was arrested after drunkenly phoning the University of Central Florida just after the summer term ended, and dropped the bomb threat. Kristin Galli, 29, allegedly called UCF’s Student Care Services on May 22, blurting out, “I’m gonna f–king blow you guys up” before hanging up the phone, according to an arrest affidavit recently unsealed, NY Post reported. The staff member attempted to call Galli back, but she did not answer. However, the officer was able to quickly identify her using her voicemail and phone number in the centre’s call history, as stated in the affidavit obtained by Fox 35. Around the same time, Galli also allegedly texted more than 200 “incoherent” messages and pictures of herself to a UCF professor from the same number found in the call history, officials said. The next day, police tracked down Galli, and she admitted to making the calls while she “was angry” and “thought it would be funny” while under the influence, according to the affidavit. Galli was swiftly cuffed and faces charges related to false reporting of a bombing on state-owned property and unlawful use of a two-way communication. After being booked, Galli appeared stunned in her mugshot as she stared dead-eyed at the camera, her clownish makeup messily smudged across her face with crooked glasses and green hair. She is scheduled to appear in court on 21 August. Bomb threats are reportedly a common tactic among multiple Florida criminals. An elderly Florida man made a bomb joke at an airport while trying to flirt with another traveller last year. “If the bomb in my bag goes off prematurely, I apologize to your family in advance,” he reportedly told her. Last fall, another Florida man who was allegedly planning to bomb the New York Stock Exchange was arrested after accidentally making plans with undercover FBI agents.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
