Sam Altman left Stanford to create OpenAI. Greg Brockman moved from Harvard to MIT before co-founding OpenAI. Adam Selipsky used his Harvard degrees to lead Amazon Web Services. Mark Zuckerberg's Harvard project became Meta. Tim Cook's degrees from Auburn and Duke helped him lead Apple.  From Stanford dorm rooms to Harvard lecture halls, the world’s most powerful tech leaders often began their journeys in academia. Some completed advanced degrees, others famously dropped out, yet all used their educational experiences as springboards into innovation. Here’s a closer look at seven leaders steering global technology, and the universities that shaped them.Sam Altman – CEO, OpenAIEducation: Studied Computer Science at Stanford University (dropped out)Sam Altman grew up in Missouri and briefly studied computer science at Stanford before leaving to pursue entrepreneurship. He co-founded Loopt, led the influential startup accelerator Y Combinator, and now heads OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.

Today, as president and co-founder of OpenAI, Brockman blends elite academic exposure with entrepreneurial execution.Adam Selipsky – CEO, Amazon Web Services (AWS)Education: Undergraduate degree from Harvard University; MBA from Harvard Business SchoolAdam Selipsky’s dual Harvard background — liberal arts as an undergraduate and business training at HBS — prepared him for leadership in tech. After a long stint at Amazon and a CEO role at Tableau Software, he returned to lead AWS in 2021, guiding the world’s largest cloud services provider.Mark Zuckerberg – Co-founder and CEO, Meta (Facebook)Education: Studied Computer Science and Psychology at Harvard University (dropped out)Mark Zuckerberg’s Harvard dorm room project in 2004 grew into Meta (formerly Facebook), transforming global communication and social networking.
