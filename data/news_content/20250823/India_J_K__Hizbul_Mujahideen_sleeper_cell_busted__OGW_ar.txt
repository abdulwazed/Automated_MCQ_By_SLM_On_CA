NEW DELHI: In a significant breakthrough, the state investigation agency (SIA) of Jammu and Kashmir Police on Saturday apprehended an over-ground worker (OGW) linked to the proscribed terrorist outfit Hizbul Mujahideen (Hizb).The arrested individual, identified as Altaf Hussain Wagay, hails from the Reban Gund area of Behram, Shopian. According to an SIA spokesperson, Wagay had been operating as a sleeper cell for Hizb and was involved in facilitating terror-related activities in the region.“Following relentless efforts, SIA Kashmir has achieved a major success by apprehending an OGW, Altaf Hussain Wagay, resident of Reban Gund area of Behram in Shopian,” the spokesperson said in a statement.The arrest was made in connection with an ongoing investigation into a terrorism-related case. During the probe, the agency gathered credible evidence establishing Wagay’s direct links with a terrorist handler from Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, who is believed to be operating from across the border.“On the behest of the terrorist handler, the OGW was orchestrating terrorist, unlawful and anti-national activities by actively engaging in terrorist conspiracy, propagating and furthering anti-India narratives,” the official added.Authorities believe Wagay played a key role in spreading extremist ideology and assisting the revival of terrorist networks in south Kashmir by maintaining discreet but coordinated communication with handlers outside the country.The SIA said further investigations are underway to uncover the broader network of operatives and sleeper cells associated with Hizb-ul-Mujahideen in the Union territory.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
