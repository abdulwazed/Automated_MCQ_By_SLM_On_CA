        "input": "External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar stated that Indias relationship with China should be considered independently from its ties with the United States. He cautioned against assuming a direct causal link between Washingtons and Beijings relations with New Delhi.  NEW DELHI External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said that Indias relationship with China should not be viewed through the prism of New Delhis ties with the United States. Speaking at The Economic Times World Leaders Forum 2025 Jaishankar said What I want you to understand is its not black and white. Its not that something has happened with America so therefore immediately something has happened with China. There are different timelines of different lengths on different problems. He added that it would be a mistaken analysis to assume events with Washington automatically dictated New Delhis stance with Beijing. There is a flow of that relationship. There are other relationships but dont make this connection so tight dont make it a causality. Thats not the reality he said.The ministers comments come against the backdrop of trade tensions with Washington after the Trump administration sharply raised tariffs on Indian goods in response to New Delhis purchase of Russian oil. Jaishankar said India remained committed to protecting its farmers and small producers calling the tariff hike unjustified and unreasonable. He argued the issue had been mischaracterised as an oil dispute pointing out that larger importers such as China and European nations had not faced similar criticism. The same arguments that have been used to target India have not been applied to the largest oil importer which is China and have not been applied to the largest LNG importer which is the European nations he said.Jaishankars remarks came soon after his visit to Moscow where he met President Vladimir Putin and senior Russian officials and ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modis scheduled trip to Japan and China later this month for the SCO summit.

Dr S Jaishankar File photo NEW DELHI External affairs minister Dr S Jaishankar on Saturday took a sharp swipe at US and Pakistan saying both countries had a habit of overlooking history.Speaking at Economic Times World Leaders Forum the foreign minister cited the 2011 US raid in Abbottabad that killed Osama bin Laden. He reminded that it was the same Pakistan that had sheltered the 911 attacker.They have a history with each other and they have a history of overlooking their history. It is the same military that went into Abbottabad in Pakistan and found who there Dr Jaishankar asked.He further underlined that Indias foreign policy was guided by longterm confidence rather than shortterm politics of convenience. When countries focus on the politics of convenience they keep trying to do this or that. But I always keep in mind the larger structural strengths of the relationship and the confidence that comes from it. At the end of the day I know my strengths and I know the importance of my relationships he said.The EAM also reiterated that US didnt mediate between India and Pakistan for the ceasefire after the conflict following Indias Operation Sindoor.Since 1970s for more than 50 years now theres a national consensus in this country that we do not accept mediation in our relations with Pakistan he said.He further explained that calls from the US and other countries were made during Operation Sindoor but clarified that these were routine diplomatic exchanges not negotiations. Every American phone call I had is there on my X account he said emphasising that the settlement was the result of direct talks between India and Pakistan and pushing back against the narrative by opposition and US president Donald Trump that US negotiated the ceasefire.The external affairs minister also used the occasion to attack the opposition saying that India was also resisting external pressures to protect its national economic interests.When it comes to trade and the interests of farmers when it comes to our strategic autonomy when it comes to opposing mediation this government is very clear. Our positions are firm he said warning that If anybody disagrees with us please tell the people of India that you are not prepared to defend the interests of farmers. Please tell the people of India that you dont value strategic autonomy. We do. We will do whatever we have to do to maintain it.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

        "input": "Amartya Sen voiced concerns that Bihars electoral roll revision could disenfranchise the poor due to strict documentation requirements. The Supreme Court questioned the lack of political party involvement in correcting voter deletions during the revision. The court allowed online claim submissions with Aadhaar or other documents seeking status reports from political parties by September 8. Amartya Sen NEW DELHI Nobel laureate Amartya Sen raised concerns over the special intensive revision SIR of electoral rolls in pollbound Bihar cautioning that without sensitivity the exercise could disenfranchise large sections of the poor and marginalised. He questioned the fairness of a bureaucratic process that requires strict documentation from citizens who may not have easy access to such papers. Bihar SIR SC Slams Political Parties Silence Directs Poll Panel To Accept Aadhaar Or 11 DocumentsWhile acknowledging the need for administrative checks and periodic revisions Sen stressed these must not come at the expense of fundamental rights.Yes its true that from time to time various procedural tasks need to be carried out. However in doing so one cannot create a better system by trampling on the rights of the poor Sen told news agency PTI.He emphasised the importance of a just and inclusive approach pointing out that many individuals still lack proper documentation and as a result are often excluded from the electoral process.Many people dont have documents. Many cannot vote. If in the name of trying to improve things a little harm is caused to many then that becomes a serious mistake Sen said adding You cannot justify seven new mistakes just to correct one.Meanwhile the Supreme Court on Friday expressed surprise at the lack of political parties involvement in correcting names of voters deleted during the SIR of the electoral rolls in Bihar. The top court also said that claim forms can be submitted along with Aadhaar card or any other 11 acceptable documents. We will allow online submission of claims of deleted voters with Aadhaar card or any other acceptable documents for Bihar SIR the bench said as quoted by PTI. All the political parties shall file the status report by the next date of hearing on the claim form they had facilitated in filing by excluded voters the bench added. The matter has been posted for hearing on September 8. During the hearing the Election Commission informed the court that while 85000 new voters had been added in the ongoing revision only two objections had been filed by boothlevel agents of political parties. A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi was hearing a batch of petitions challenging the SIR exercise. The petitions were filed by RJD MP Manoj Jha the Association for Democratic Reforms ADR PUCL activist Yogendra Yadav Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra and former Bihar MLA Mujahid Alam.

The real way forward he stressed was through cooperation and respect. The relationship has been strained in recent weeks with the Trump administration set to impose secondary sanctions on India for its oil trade with Russia.We are concerned. This struggle between President Trump and PM Modi is unfortunate. It seems to me its a reflection that great nations dont necessarily exhibit greatness by giving people ultimatums all the time Kerry said at the ET World Leaders Forum. He expressed hope India and the US would resolve their trade dispute noting that India had offered to place almost 60 of goods at zero tariff. Thats a big shift. We need to get to a better place faster he said.Kerry who served under President Obama appreciated Trumps peace efforts with Russian President Vladimir Putin but said Putin had no intention of ending the war. He sees gains on the ground disarray in the West and Trumps wavering stance on staying power he said contrasting it with Bidens firm support for Ukraine.Calling Russia a gas station with a lot of gas Kerry said its longrun economic prospects were bleak. He added that both Russias security concerns and Ukraines guarantees needed serious discussion.

        "input": "Berlin's Mohrenstrasse, a street with a racist name rooted in Germany's colonial past, was slated to be renamed after Anton Wilhelm Amo, the first African-born scholar to earn a European doctorate. Despite years of lobbying and legal battles, residents initially blocked the change, but the courts ultimately upheld the renaming. AP file photo  \"Decolonization does not happen by changing a few street names,\" political scientist and human rights activist Joshua Kwesi Aikins told DW after it was announced on Friday that a central Berlin street will not have its racist name changed after all. The road had been slated to be renamed in honor of Anton Wilhelm Amo, a Black German Enlightenment philosopher, who in 1734 became the first Africa-born scholar to receive a European doctorate.That was in 2020. At the time, the district council of Berlin-Mitte had approved the renaming, but before it was implemented, residents filed a lawsuit against it.But five years later, in July this year, the Higher Administrative Court of Berlin-Brandenburg upheld a decision by the Berlin Administrative Court stating that residents have no basis to take legal action against the name change.Signs had already been installed, and the change was to be officialized through a symbolic unveiling on Saturday, August 23, which also marks International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition. Though the group \"Pro Mohrenstra\u00dfe\" made a last-ditch legal attempt to block the name change, the Berlin-Brandenburg court again upheld its ruling to allow for the name change.Dividing up Africa from BerlinSeveral civil society groups have lobbied for decades to change the name of Mohren or \"Moor\" Street (respectfully referred to as M-Strasse), and the U-Bahn station of the same name.Moor, in its Greek roots, means dark or black, but also \"stupid or primitive,\" Aikins said.M-Strasse runs through the old quarter of the former Prussian city, steps away from the rebuilt Berlin Palace, which oversaw colonial forays into Africa, and near the former chancellor's residence and venue for the 1884-1885 Berlin Conference.In the words of Berlin-based British-Ugandan writer Musa Okwonga, the major European colonial powers that gathered for the conference \"discussed how they might divide up Africa.\" The conference kickstarted Germany's genocidal colonial rule in Namibia. The M-word's overt racist connotations further derive from the 18th-century practice of bringing enslaved Africans to Germany as \"court moors\" to work as servants or entertain the Brandenburg electors and Prussian kings as musicians. \"The street name given at the beginning of the 18th century transports this racist experience of violence against Black people in Berlin to the present day,\" wrote historian Christian Kopp of Decolonize Berlin-Mitte.These slaves were mostly brought from the Brandenburg-Prussian colony in current-day Ghana (then known as the Brandenburger Gold Coast), which existed from 1682 to 1721.Who was Anton Wilhelm Amo?Anton Wilhelm Amo himself was enslaved as a boy in Ghana and taken to Amsterdam around 1703. He was then gifted to the German Duke of Braunschweig-Wolfenb\u00fcttel in 1707, the year M-Strasse was named.Encouraged to study by the Duke, who paid for his education, Amo went on to become the first African-born scholar in Europe to complete a PhD in 1734.Despite Amo's displacement, he embraced his German identity while never forgetting his African heritage. Amo's thesis in law at the University of Halle is lost but was titled \"The Rights of Blacks in Europe,\" which looked at the legal rights of People of Color in the continent.It is said that Amo learned six languages. He later wrote a second doctoral thesis in philosophy that weighed in on philosopher Rene Descartes and his ideas about the duality between mind and body. He also taught classes at the universities in Halle and nearby Jena, but made a meager living before returning to Ghana in 1747. The date of his death is unknown.Amo is remembered as the first philosopher of African origin in Germany, yet this trailblazer has been largely erased from European intellectual history.The naming of Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Strasse demands a greater appreciation of the scholar's work \"as a philosopher and legal scholar, and the professional context in which he worked,\" wrote Anna Orinsky in the online journal, EUIdeas. \"German and international historians, philosophers and scholars of many other disciplines are called upon to analyse Amo\u2019s work,\" she added. But the renaming is also in honor of a symbol of Black resistance, says Andrea-Vicky Amankwaa-Birago, a Berlin-based cultural scientist focused on decolonization across Germany and Ghana.\"This renaming signals a change in how we remember \u2014 placing Black history, achievement, and resilience at the center,\" she wrote in August 2025 for internet publication, Medium.The long journey to Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-StrasseThe M-Strasse subway station was itself renamed in 1991, in the wake of reunification. It had previously been called Otto-Grotewohl-Strasse after a GDR politician.The use of the racist name was called out at the time by the pioneering Black German activist May Ayim, a poet of Ghanaian descent who co-founded the Initiative of Black People in Germany in 1986 and edited the defining book \"Showing Our Colors: Afro-German Women Speak Out.\" Ayim pursued her efforts to reveal the coded racism in reunified Germany. In the 1990s, she was outspoken in her opposition to the street name, which in her view stood for the fact that Germany's Black community was not included in the country's essentially white reunification process after the fall of the Berlin Wall.In 2010, a Kreuzberg riverfront was renamed after Ayim, who died in 1996. It was one of the first acts of decolonization, the shore having been named after Otto Friedrich von der Groeben, who in the late 17th century founded the Brandenburg-Prussian colony in Ghana.",

These deals, framed as temporary arrangements, have sparked controversy and raised questions about the benefits for the host nations, with Nigeria rejecting the proposal outright. AP file photo  US President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration is a cornerstone of his domestic policy, forming part of his controversial campaign pledge to carry out \"the largest deportation operation in American history.\"Deporting those migrants to African countries, however, was not part of the original plan he announced when he ran for the presidency in 2024.But the US Department of Homeland Security said in June that third-country deportations \u2014 i.e. sending undocumented migrants from the US to countries other than their own \u2014 were necessary to expel people \"so uniquely barbaric that their own countries won't take them back.\" Uganda has now become the latest country in East Africa to accept a deal with Washington, pledging to take in a yet to-be-specified number of migrants who do not qualify to remain in the United States.Alex Vines, the head of the Africa Programme at Chatham House, a renowned think-tank in London, highlights that this agreement builds on schemes between the US with other African nations adopted earlier in the year.\"In July [2025], a small number of individuals were sent to South Sudan and Eswatini. These were less than ten in total, but it shows the direction of travel\", Vines told DW. \"The Uganda deal is a lot more ambitious.\"\"The Ugandans themselves have said they would not accept people with criminal records or minors, and preferred Africans as the ones they would accept,\" Vines further pointed out, raising questions about the purpose of the scheme.Uganda: a stretched-out refugee nationJust days prior to the confirmation of the deal, Uganda's state minister for foreign affairs, Henry Oryem Okello, claimed the country did not have the capabilities to take in migrants.But after initially denying the deal with the US government, Vincent Bagiire, the permanent secretary of Uganda's Foreign Affairs Ministry, confirmed the deal while saying it was only a \"temporary arrangement.\" Uganda already hosts the largest refugee population in Africa, with roughly 1.7 million people housed in various camps across the country, according to the United Nations.These are for the most part asylum-seekers and recognized refugees, who hail from other countries in the region such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Sudan.For the most part, these immigrant communities live peacefully alongside the local population \u2014 but some think this might change:\"Uganda is a hospitable country, hosting many refugees. That is not a big thing to us. But already as a host country, we are choking,\" says Dorcus Kimono, a local living in the capital, Kampala.\"If these migrants are coming to our country, we would not mind sharing the little we have with them. But what is the American government doing for us?\"Alex Wandeba, another resident of Kampala, shares her views: \"Uganda is already overburdened; we have many refugees from the neighboring countries. I feel we have enough on the table.\"Kimono meanwhile wonders how Ugandans will ultimately benefit from the agreement with the United States:\"I would want to hear [that if] a deal is reached with our government, that the US is constructing roads, or they are going to help us in the health and education sector. That would be a good deal.\u201dEswatini: a kingdom with no rightsThough prior US administrations have also conducted third-country removals, the Trump's practice of sending immigrants to countries with considerable political and human rights crises have raised alarm among human rights' groups.This was particularly notable last month, when the US flew five immigrants from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Yemen and Cuba to Eswatini \u2014 the last absolute monarchy in Africa, which is known for its troubling rights record.Eswatini has been ruled by Mswati III since 1986. The monarch leads a life of luxury while the population of 1,2 million of the landlocked nation remains poor.The country has a deteriorating human rights record, according to Human Rights Watch and according to reports penned by the US State Department itself, as recently as 2023.Political Activist Mphandlana Shongwe says there is widespread public anger in Eswatini about the king's decision to allow those immigrants into the country, which appears to fall on deaf ears. \"We condemn the bringing of hardcore convicts to our country to mix with our young convicts, who still have a chance to be rehabilitated,\" Shongwe told DW.Government spokesperson Thabile Mdluli meanwhile assured the public that the five inmates \"pose no threat to the country or its citizens,\" as they were being kept in isolation, at least for now.South Sudan: war-torn and unsafeConflict-torn South Sudan meanwhile has also agreed to accept immigrants sent by the Trump administration.Edmund Yakani, President of the East African Civil Society Organizations Forum, told DW that details of the deal were being kept hidden from the public.Alex Vines meanwhile believes that it's all about geopolitics. \"It is about these countries looking at how to diversify their partnerships and engender improved relationships with the Trump administration that might carry money and other benefits longer term to them,\" he said. \"South Sudan is very much in the crosshairs of the current US administration visa strategy of restricting access to the US because of [a history of] overstay of South Sudanese\", Vines further explained, adding that there is also the issue of the US tariffs, which \"may be reduced, although that has not impacted these countries particularly.\"Rwanda: acting out of good will?Rwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makolor confirmed that her country would also take up to 250 deportees from the US under the provision that the government maintains \"the ability to approve each individual proposed for resettlement\" under the agreement.Elaborating on why Rwanda accepted the US deal, Makolo stated the agreement meant that the African country was doing its part to help with international migration issues because \"our societal values are founded on reintegration and rehabilitation.\"Other African nations that are known to have been approached by the US for deporatation deals include Liberia, Senegal, Gabon, Mauretania and Guinea-Bissau.Nigeria has explicitly rejected any proposal by the US, with its Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar saying the country already had \"enough of its own problems.\"",

Musk previously labeled Gor a \"snake\" and accused him of legal violations related to security clearance paperwork. Trump defended Gor, emphasizing his loyalty and importance to US-India relations amidst ongoing tariff disputes. File photo: Elon Musk (left) and Sergio Gor (Picture credit: AP, X) Sergio Gor, a close aide to US President Donald Trump, has been nominated as the next US Ambassador to India and special envoy for South and Central Asian Affairs.However, amid the buzz of his announcement, his past clashes with Elon Musk have resurfaced and brought focus on his stormy history with the Tesla founder. Back in June, Musk branded Gor \u201ca snake\u201d after the New York Post revealed he had failed to submit his full security clearance paperwork despite being responsible for vetting thousands of appointees. Musk also accused him of \u201cbreaking the law\u201d by not filing the Standard Form 86 (SF-86), required for security clearance background checks.According to the Daily Beast, Gor allegedly persuaded Trump to withdraw Musk\u2019s close friend Jared Isaacman\u2019s nomination to lead Nasa, days before Senate confirmation. Musk said Gor orchestrated Isaacman\u2019s downfall to settle scores, following a confrontation during his stint on Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which aimed to slash federal spending. Musk, who quit DOGE in May, later criticised Gor for delays in staffing and clashed with him during cost-cutting reviews.According to the Post, Gor held a grudge after Musk, then serving on Trump\u2019s task force, publicly criticised him. \u201cSergio was upset about Elon dressing him down at the meeting and said he was going to \u2018get him,\u2019\u201d a source told the outlet. The tensions likely added to Musk\u2019s rupture with Trump in early June, when he opposed the president\u2019s sweeping tax-cut and spending bill, warning it would worsen federal debt. Days later, Musk briefly backed impeachment, prompting Trump to threaten cancellation of federal contracts with his companies.Announcing the decision on social media, Trump described Gor as \u201ca great friend, who has been at my side for many years,\u201d and said his appointment to New Delhi was vital at a time when Washington and New Delhi are locked in a bitter tariff dispute.\u201cFor the most populous region in the world, it is important that I have someone I can fully trust to deliver on my agenda and help us make America great again. Sergio will make an incredible Ambassador,\u201d the president said.He highlighted Gor\u2019s role in his campaigns, book publishing ventures, and super PACs, calling his service \u201cessential\u201d to the administration. Vice President JD Vance and US foreign secretary Marco Rubio also welcomed the appointment, with Rubio describing US\u2013India relations as \u201cthe most important relationship.\u201dGor, 38, currently heads the White House Presidential Personnel Office, overseeing the recruitment of nearly 4,000 federal officials. He will continue in that role until the Senate confirms his appointment. In a post on X, Gor said he was \u201cbeyond grateful\u201d to Trump for his trust, calling the ambassadorship \u201cthe honour of my life.\u201dGor will replace Eric Garcetti. His appointment comes as India grapples with 50 per cent US tariffs on its goods, including penalties linked to Russian oil purchases.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

        "input": "Donald Trump's claim that fewer than 20 hostages remain alive in Gaza has sparked outrage from families and a swift denial from Israel's hostage negotiator. Trump asserted credit for releasing \"hundreds\" of hostages, a figure disputed by facts. Israeli officials maintain that 50 hostages are still held, with 20 believed to be alive, while denouncing Hamas's \"extortion\" tactics. AP file photo  US President Donald Trump said that fewer than 20 hostages held in Gaza remain alive, a remark that has drawn anguish from families of the captives and was promptly denied by Israel\u2019s hostage negotiator. \u201cSo now they have 20,\u201d Trump said while speaking to reporters at the Oval Office on Friday. \u201cBut the 20 is actually probably not 20 because a couple of them are not around any longer.\u201d\u201cAnd you have to understand, I\u2019m the one who got all of the hostages out,\u201d Trump said, claiming credit for the release of \u201chundreds\u201d of captives, even though fewer than 150 remained in Gaza when he assumed office on January 20, reported the Times of Israel.Following his remarks, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum released a statement that read, \u201cMr. President, there are 50 hostages. For us, each and every one of them is a world in itself.\u201dTrump also claimed credit for securing releases during the January-March ceasefire, denounced Hamas\u2019s \u201cextortion\u201d and outlined ongoing efforts to recover the rest of the hostages.\u201cThe situation has to end, it\u2019s extortion and it has to end,\u201d Trump said, referring to Hamas\u2019s hostage-taking and negotiations. He added that he believes it would be \u201csafer, in many ways,\u201d to free the captives through a military operation rather than a deal with Hamas. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to get the hostages out, it\u2019s not easy,\u201d he added.Israel\u2019s ministry refutes claimsIsrael\u2019s coordinator for hostage affairs, Gal Hirsch, said in a statement following Trump\u2019s remarks that, \u201caccording to the information we have, there is no change in the number of living hostages,\u201d. \u201cTwenty of the hostages are alive, two [others] are in grave danger for their lives, 28 are no longer alive and have been declared deceased,\u201d he wrote to the families.Trump was also questioned about why the United States seems to support Israel\u2019s move to seize control of Gaza City, despite opposition from the families of the hostages who fear the move could endanger their loved ones. \u201cNot all of them,\u201d Trump replied, seemingly pointing to a minority of hostage relatives who support Israel\u2019s expanded operation in Gaza.Israeli officials maintain that 50 hostages are being held in Gaza, 49 of the 251 abducted during the Hamas-led assault on October 7, 2023, along with one captive taken earlier. 28 among them have been confirmed dead by the IDF, and authorities believe 20 hostages are still alive. The condition of two others remain in serious doubt. Hamas is also reportedly holding the body of an IDF soldier killed in Gaza in 2014, as per the Times of Israel. Earlier this week, Israel advanced further into Gaza, pressing ahead with its plan to seize the territory while simultaneously approving thousands of new housing units in the occupied West Bank, steps that drew international concern and renewed debate over the prospects of a Palestinian state.Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin, the IDF\u2019s chief spokesperson, announced that Israel \u201chas begun the next phase of the war,\u201d noting that troops had reached the outskirts of Gaza City and were preparing to relocate displaced residents to southern Gaza, reported The New York Times.More than 62,000 people have been killed in the besieged Gaza Strip since the start of the conflict, as per Gaza\u2019s health ministry.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Guerrero, armed with a knife, allegedly slashed a government vehicle's tire before confronting the agents, resulting in charges of assault and property destruction. San Francisco: ICE clashes with protesters; charge knife-wielding suspect (Picture credit: DHS) Federal authorities on Friday said US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers clashed with protesters in San Francisco this week, with one knife-wielding suspect now facing charges after allegedly threatening to stab an officer and target his family. The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirmed the incident happened on Wednesday outside 100 Montgomery Street, where ICE agents were carrying out immigration enforcement. Around 15\u201320 demonstrators surrounded four officers, spraying pepper spray and physically assaulting them. One officer sustained a jammed finger, while others suffered irritation from chemical spray, DHS said. Court filings cited by the New York Post identified the suspect as Adrian Guerrero, a US citizen. He has been charged with assaulting an officer and destruction of property. Guerrero is accused of slashing the tire of a government-marked Chevrolet earlier that morning before confronting ICE agents. While wielding a black knife and wearing a patterned keffiyeh-style scarf with tinted goggles, Guerrero allegedly shouted, \u201cI\u2019m going to f** you up. I\u2019m going to go after your family. I\u2019m going to stab you.\u201d Photos cited in the complaint show Guerrero confronting agents, reported the New York Post. He was arrested still carrying the knife and clothing described. Federal Protective Services and San Francisco police later arrived to help disperse the crowd. According to KQED, confrontations with protesters began earlier that morning near the immigration courthouse. An ICE officer pepper-sprayed both a protester and a reporter, who said he was filming the incident when an officer grabbed a bicycle handle and sprayed without provocation. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t provoked \u2026 There were no aggressive movements other than me approaching the scene,\u201d the journalist was quoted as saying by KQED. At least one protester was later detained outside ICE\u2019s Sansome Street field office after being tackled, zip-tied, and taken inside.KQED reported that an ICE officer also fired a weapon that released white powder during a scuffle involving a protester and a bike. The confrontation eventually dispersed, though many protesters regrouped at the courthouse midmorning. Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem condemned the assault, saying ICE officers now face a \u201c1,000% increase in assaults\u201d while targeting dangerous offenders. \u201cThese acts of violence are fuelled by sanctuary politicians\u2019 rhetoric vilifying our law enforcement,\u201d she said in a DHS statement. \u201cWe will not and have not let this violence stop us or slow us down\u201d, she added. The attack follows other violent confrontations with federal agents. In July, ten armed men in tactical gear opened fire on an ICE detention centre near Dallas, where all suspects were later charged with attempted murder, according to the New York Post.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The decision follows a similar rejection for Erik, keeping both brothers incarcerated despite their reduced sentences. Lyle Menendez appears before the parole board via teleconference at the Richard J Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego. (Picture credit: AP) Lyle Menendez, one of the two brothers convicted of murdering their wealthy parents in Beverly Hills more than three decades ago, has been denied parole by a California state panel.The 57-year-old, who uses his middle name Joseph, appeared by video from a San Diego prison on Friday for his first parole hearing since being resentenced earlier this year. After an 11-hour closed-door session, commissioners decided he must remain behind bars for at least three more years, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. \u201cJoseph (Lyle) Menendez was denied parole for three years at his initial suitability hearing today,\u201d the department said in a statement, as cited by news agency AFP.The ruling follows Thursday\u2019s decision in the case of his younger brother, Erik, 54, whose parole was also rejected. The siblings, convicted in 1996 of killing Jose and Kitty Menendez with shotguns in 1989, were originally sentenced to life without parole. A Los Angeles judge reduced those terms in May to 50 years to life, making them eligible for release as they were under 26 at the time of the crime, as per news agency AP.The Menendez case first shocked America in 1989, when Lyle, then 21, and Erik, 18, killed their parents inside their Beverly Hills mansion. They initially told investigators it was linked to their father\u2019s business or the Mafia, but two months later Erik confessed to a psychologist that he and his brother were responsible. The brothers were arrested in 1990 and later charged with first-degree murder. Prosecutors said the motive was greed, while the defence argued they acted after years of sexual and emotional abuse, as per AP.Their first trials in the early 1990s ended with hung juries, but in 1995 they were convicted of murder, along with lying in wait and special circumstances allegations. They were sentenced the following year to life without parole. For decades, appeals were denied by state and federal courts.While in prison, the brothers engaged in education, led self-help classes, and even launched a prison beautification project inspired by Norway\u2019s rehabilitation model, according to AP. Their case has also drawn renewed public attention through true-crime shows, including Netflix\u2019s nine-episode series Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story.As per The New York Times, Friday\u2019s hearing was Lyle\u2019s first chance at release, though parole boards rarely grant freedom at an initial review. Both brothers will be eligible for new hearings in three years but could also pursue clemency from California Governor Gavin Newsom or continue legal challenges.According to AP, the parole board weighs whether inmates pose an \u201cunreasonable risk of danger to society\u201d if freed, considering their criminal history, motivation, remorse, behaviour in prison and reentry plans. Nearly all of the Menendez family members have backed their release; their uncle Milton Andersen, one of the few who opposed it, died earlier this year.Though formally denied parole for three years, the brothers may be reviewed sooner, with administrative reconsideration possible within a year and another hearing in as little as 18 months. They also still have a pending habeas corpus petition, filed in May 2023, that seeks to reopen their convictions based on new evidence supporting their claims of sexual abuse by their father.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

But high-profile incidents have thrust the issue into the spotlight.These include an Air Europa flight last year, in which 40 passengers were hurt, and a Singapore Airlines flight where one elderly passenger died and dozens were injured.\"Typically injuries (are) to unbelted passengers or cabin crew rather than structural damage,\" John Abraham, a mechanical engineering professor at the University of St. Thomas told AFP.\"Modern aircraft withstand turbulence, so the main risk is occupant injury, not loss of the plane.\"Still, planes must be inspected after \"severe\" encounters with turbulence -- about 1.5 times the normal force of Earth's gravity -- which occur some 5,000 times a year over the US, said Robert Sharman, a senior scientist emeritus at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.Turbulence also increases fuel consumption when pilots must leave optimal altitudes, alter routes or change speeds, Abraham added.How climate change is making it worseMohamed Foudad, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Reading in the UK, explained there are three main types of turbulence: convective, mountain wave and clear-air turbulence (CAT).Convective turbulence is linked to rising or sinking air currents from clouds or thunderstorms that can be detected visually or by onboard radar, while mountain wave turbulence occurs over mountain ranges. CAT, by contrast, is invisible -- and therefore the most dangerous.It generally arises from jet streams: fast-moving westerly winds in the upper atmosphere at the same altitude as commercial jets, about 10-12 kilometers up.With climate change, the tropics are warming faster at cruising altitude than higher latitudes. That increases the temperature difference between the higher- and lower-latitudes, driving up jet stream velocity and wind shear -- volatile shifts in vertical air currents that trigger CAT.Foudad and colleagues published a paper last year in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres analyzing data from 1980 to 2021.\"We find a clear, positive trend -- an increase in turbulence frequency over many regions, including the North Atlantic, North America, East Asia, the Middle East and North Africa,\" he told AFP, with increases ranging from 60 to 155 percent. Further analysis attributed the rising turbulence in certain regions to increased greenhouse gas emissions.What happens next?A 2023 paper led by Isabel Smith at the University of Reading found that for every degree Celsius of near-surface warming, winters would see an increase of about nine percent in moderate CAT in the North Atlantic, and summers a rise of 14 percent.Winter has historically been the roughest season for turbulence, but warming is now amplifying CAT in summer and autumn, closing the gap.Jet stream disruption is not the only concern: climate change is also fueling stronger storms.\"Climate change may also increase the frequency and severity of thunderstorms under future scenarios, and turbulence encounters near thunderstorms are a major component of turbulence accidents,\" Sharman told AFP.In terms of mitigation strategies, Foudad is working on two studies: optimizing flight routes to avoid turbulence hotspots and improving forecasting accuracy.Some airlines are moving towards strategies involving passengers wearing seatbelts more often, such as ending cabin service earlier.Promising technologies are also being tested, says Sharman, including onboard LIDAR, which beams lasers into the atmosphere to detect subtle shifts in air density and wind speed.Ultimately, cutting greenhouse gas emissions will be essential, Foudad added.Aviation is responsible for about 3.5 percent of human-caused warming. Airlines are exploring cleaner fuels to help reduce the industry's footprint, though progress has been \"disappointingly slow,\" according to the International Air Transport Association.",

This sighting is believed to be the first recorded appearance of this species in the district, sparking hope and excitement within the wildlife community.Historically, the chital roamed freely across the Aravalis, stretching from Gurgaon to the Delhi Ridge. However, the rapid urbanisation of the 1980s and 1990s \u2014 fuelled by mining, real estate expansion, and deforestation \u2014 fragmented their habitats, pushing them into core forest zones like the Asola-Bhatti wildlife sanctuary. A 2017 Wildlife Institute of India (WII) survey of Haryana's Aravalis reported a significant decline in wildlife population, including that of the spotted deer, due to habitat loss and fragmentation.According to officials, this is the first confirmed sighting of a spotted deer in the Aravalis in recent records. Vivek Saxena, principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife), said, \"We do not have data on the last sighting of chital in the Aravalis, but this sighting definitely shows that habitat improvements helped wildlife return to the region.\"You Can Also Check: Gurgaon AQI | Weather in Gurgaon | Bank Holidays in Gurgaon | Public Holidays in Gurgaon | Gold Rates Today in Gurgaon | Silver Rates Today in GurgaonThe sighting underscores the significance of green spaces at the urban fringe. Badkhal lake is situated at the edge of the Southern Aravali Ridge, which connects to the larger Delhi Ridge ecology and links with areas like the Asola-Bhatti sanctuary, an essential corridor for wildlife in this region.\"Wildlife, when given undisturbed green spaces, sometimes ventures back into areas we might consider too crowded. This visit could indicate that the wildlife corridor is active or that native habitat is gradually reclaiming ground. Either way, it serves as a subtle reminder of the broader environmental threads still weaving through our daily lives,\" said wildlife biologist Sumit Dookia.If sightings like this become more frequent, experts suggested it could be time to consider restoring or strengthening habitat links, including corridors between Asola and Sarika, where the spotted deer population is currently active.\"Seeing a spotted deer in Faridabad is a positive sign. It shows that even small patches of forest and wetlands can support wildlife if they are protected. What's crucial now is to ensure these green spaces remain connected so animals can move safely across the Aravalis,\" said wildlife expert Sunil Harsana.

Spain is struggling with numerous fires in the west of the country, which have claimed four lives. By far it is the most affected EU country by fires, with more than 400,000 hectares burnt, accounting for nearly 40 percent of the EU total. Portugal, which holds the EU record of 563,530 hectares burnt in 2017, is the second-most affected EU country. It has never had an area of this size (nearly 274,000 hectares) burnt as of August 21. Romania follows with 126,000 hectares while in France, 35,600 hectares of forest have been reduced to ashes, mostly in the Aude region, which was ravaged by a massive fire in early August. These calculations by EFFIS, a component of the European climate monitor Copernicus, only take into account fires that have burnt areas of at least 30 hectares.",

They said the changes, which are driven by climate change, could lead to \"catastrophic consequences for generations.\"The research was published in the journal Nature. It sought to describe the interlocking effects of global warming on the Antarctic, the frozen continent at the planet's South Pole.The \"overwhelming evidence of a regime shift in sea ice\" means that, on current trends, Antarctica could essentially become ice free in summer sooner than the Arctic, the study found.This will speed up warming in the region and beyond, and could push some marine species toward extinction.\"Antarctic sea ice may actually be one of those tipping points in the Earth's system,\" said the study's lead author Nerilie Abram, a former professor at the Australian National University (ANU) and now chief scientist at the Australian Antarctic Division.The study warns that curbing global carbon dioxide emissions would reduce the risk of major changes in the Antarctic but still may not prevent them.\"Once we start losing Antarctic sea ice, we set in train this self-perpetuating process,\" Abram said. \"Even if we stabilize the climate, we are committed to still losing Antarctic sea ice over many centuries to come.\"What did the study say?Researchers gathered data from observations, ice cores, and ship logbooks to chart long-term changes in the area of sea ice.A \"rapid and substantial slowdown\" of the currents has already begun.\"This would lead to widespread climate and ecosystem impacts,\" ranging from an intensification of global warming to a decrease in the ocean's capacity to absorb CO2, the study reported.Will it affect wildlife?Some 90% of the heat generated by manmade global warming is soaked up by oceans.Since 2014, sea ice has retreated on average 120 kilometers (75 miles) from the continent's shoreline. Loss of ice is harming wildlife, including emperor penguins, who breed on the ice, and krill, which feed below it.And warming waters will further reduce phytoplankton populations that draw down vast quantities of carbon from the atmosphere, the study reported.",

The deluge washed away roads, damaged homes, and disrupted train services on the Jammu-Pathankot line. Rescue operations are underway, with the Army, NDRF, and SDRF assisting victims.  NEW DELHI: A cloudburst in Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s Kathua district has left at least seven people dead and several others injured, triggering landslides, flash floods and large-scale disruption. The incident, which occurred late Saturday night in Jodh Ghati village, washed away roads, damaged homes, and forced authorities into urgent rescue and relief operations.Train services along the vital Jammu-Pathankot line have also been suspended as rising water levels crossed danger marks on a key railway bridge. Helicopter evacuations have been launched, while multiple agencies including the Army, NDRF, SDRF and police are on the ground to restore connectivity and assist victims.Here are the top developments:Death toll rises to seven in KathuaOfficials confirmed that seven people have died in two separate incidents of cloudburst and landslide in Kathua. Five casualties occurred in Jodh Ghati following flash floods triggered by the overnight downpour, while two more died after a landslide in Janglote.Jammu Divisional Commissioner Ramesh Kumar said, \u201cThere was heavy rain in Kathua since last night... Seven people have died due to the landslide. Rescue operations are ongoing... Those who died due to the landslide, their bodies have been retrieved.\u201d Rescue teams are still combing through debris and flood-hit areas amid fears of more missing persons. Helicopters were pressed into service due to washed-away roads and villages cut off from access.Train traffic disrupted on Jammu-Pathankot lineRail connectivity has been badly affected with the suspension of up-line train movement between Kathua and Budhi. Senior Divisional Commercial Manager, Jammu Railway Division, Uchit Singhal, said: \u201cDue to heavy rains, water is flowing above the danger level through bridge number 43 between Kathua-Budhi. In view of this, temporarily till the water level subsides, up-line movement has been suspended, and in the meantime, up trains are being moved via a temporary single line through the down line track.\u201d Villages cut off after flash floods and landslidesThe cloudburst snapped access to Jodh Ghati village, where floodwaters swept through homes and agricultural fields, leaving families stranded. Several connecting roads were washed away, and a bridge collapsed, worsening the situation. Deputy Commissioner Kathua Rajesh Sharma confirmed that rescue operations are underway and that stranded people are being shifted to safer areas. Local police reported that a station building in Kathua had also been damaged. Rescue operations led by Army and NDRFThe Indian Army, NDRF, SDRF, police and BRO have been deployed in full strength across Kathua. Heavy machinery has been brought in to fragment massive boulders that rolled down into residential areas. Inspector General of Police, Jammu Zone, Bhim Sen Tuti, said, \u201cBoulders had fallen here which needed to be fragmented... Heavy machinery has been called for that. With the help of BRO, they are being fragmented here. These boulders are being removed by using explosives wherever needed, and bodies have been recovered from beneath them.\u201dHelicopter evacuation for injured victimsUnion minister Jitendra Singh confirmed that helicopter services were arranged to shift injured people to nearby hospitals. In his social media post, Singh wrote, \u201cHelicopter services have been arranged for shifting the injured to appropriate hospitals. 6 injured have been airlifted for hospitalisation in Mamoon, Pathankot, which was found to be relatively nearer destination.\u201d DIG Police Shiv Kumar Sharma and his team are camping at the site and coordinating airlifts. Centre closely monitoring situation, says Amit ShahUnion home minister Amit Shah assured full support from the Central government. In a post on X, Shah wrote, \u201cSpoke with the Lieutenant Governor and Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir regarding the cloudburst in Kathua. Relief and rescue operations are being carried out by the local administration, and NDRF teams have also been rushed to the site. Assured every support from the Modi government. We stand firmly behind our sisters and brothers of J&K.\u201d LG Manoj Sinha calls tragedy 'mind-numbing'Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha expressed grief over the loss of lives. In his message on X, he wrote: \u201cDeeply anguished by the loss of lives in the devastating rain-triggered landslides in several areas of Kathua. The tragedy is mind-numbing. Briefed Hon\u2019ble Union Home Minister Sh. Amit Shah Ji on rescue and relief operations by the army, NDRF, SDRF, police & administration.\u201d CM Omar Abdullah announces ex-gratia reliefChief minister Omar Abdullah conveyed condolences and directed immediate assistance for affected families. A statement from his office said Rs 2 lakh would be given for each deceased, Rs 1 lakh for severely injured, and Rs 50,000 for those with minor injuries. Compensation has also been announced for damaged homes: Rs 1 lakh for fully damaged houses, Rs 50,000 for severely damaged houses, and Rs 25,000 for partially damaged houses. \u201cThe Chief Minister has directed the administration to carry out immediate relief, rescue and evacuation measures to ensure the safety and support of affected families,\u201d the statement said.Repeated cloudburst disasters in J&KThe Kathua disaster comes just three days after a cloudburst in Kishtwar\u2019s Chisoti village killed 60 people and injured over 100. Experts warn that frequent extreme weather in J&K is linked to changing rainfall patterns and climate pressures in the Himalayan region. Officials say the back-to-back incidents highlight the need for stronger disaster preparedness and better drainage infrastructure. While the state government has sought central assistance, locals in Kathua have urged long-term flood protection measures. This includes improved embankments, real-time weather alerts, and a review of building norms in vulnerable areas.Connectivity and services slowly being restoredAuthorities are now focused on restoring essential services, including power, water and road links. In Kishtwar, where floods occurred earlier, officials said blasting of boulders was undertaken to clear blocked roads. Rope bridges are being built to reconnect cut-off villages in Kathua. \u201cThe power supply and water supply have been restored. A bridge is being built here with the help of the Army... All the passengers stranded in Machail were safely evacuated yesterday,\u201d said Divisional Commissioner Ramesh Kumar.

        "input": "Wildfires continue to test firefighters and locals across Europe as droughts and heatwaves turn regions into tinderboxes. The data for 2025 alone is a sign of things to come. A cruel summer as record wildfires scorch Europe Wildfires continue to burn across the south of Europe amid record-breaking summer heatwaves in many fire-prone regions. In some places, these fires have been exacerbated by wet spring months, which have helped vegetation growth capable of catching alight with ease during a dry summer.Already, an area equivalent to 1.5 times the size of Luxembourg \u2014 roughly 438,568 hectares \u2014 has burned across Europe in 2025. That figure is almost three times the size of fire damaged caused up to the same point in 2024.It comes as some parts of southern Europe suffer through multiple 40-degree (104 Fahrenheit) days, and prolonged heatwaves lasting a fortnight.The current summer has been described as the worst for wildfires in two decades.Where are the fires burning? What is the situation right now?\"We're seeing extreme temperatures in large parts of Europe, records being broken of 40 degrees in many places,\" said Julie Berckmans, a climate scientist at the European Environmental Agency.\"Southern France, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Belgium, Netherlands, UK, are all hitting high temperatures [and] massive wildfires in Spain, Portugal, France, Greece, Turkey, Albania.\"In Spain, those fires have burned through an area the size of London already.Portugal is fighting its own fires, with around four thousand firefighters currently active across seven active sites. It has also been forced to request help from the European Union's firefighting forces.An even greater number of firefighters has been mobilized in Greece, which is battling 20 blazes during this peak fire season.Deaths have occurred in Spain, Portugal, Montenegro and Italy from fires and heat-related events this summer.It has been a severe fire seasonEurope uses data from its Copernicus satellite fleet to monitor fire activity, and collates the data via the European Forest Fires Information System (EFFIS).A substantial amount of fire damage in 2025 has already occured.More than 250,000 hectares more of land has burnt than the same time in 2024.There have more than 1,600 fires across Europe, compared to just under 1,100 last year.And new regions are also experiencing greater than usual fire activity.Spain, for instance, has seen twice as much of its territory burned-through compared to the 2006-2024 average. Romania has lost four times as much land to fires this year.Cyprus has been badly impacted. It could usually expect to see around 0.32% of its landmass burned each year. Already in 2025 it's 2.5% \u2014 nearly eight times more.But it's also the number of fires that is concerning. France has had nearly three times as many fires as average amid what has been the worst wildfire season for its southern regions in decades.More to come...The fallout of severe wildfires goes beyond land loss or human fatalities. Damage to ecosystems through vegetation loss, health impacts through smoke inhalation, and economic decline are all consequences of widespread fire events.\"It's about \u20ac2.5 billion [$2.9 billion] of damage lost every year in the EU,\" Berckmans told DW. \"45,000 people on average were displaced due to wildfires from 2008 to 2023.\"The European Environment Agency's first climate risk assessment, published in 2024, found that urgent action is required to address the critical risk wildfires will pose to populations and infastructure and biodiversity in southern Europe.\"Wildfires are an urgent risk to address,\" said Berckmans. \"It's also a major risk that needs more action now in the rest of Europe.\"As European fall approaches, the number of fires and the damage they cause should slow. However forecasting the length of fire danger season, and the behavior of fires themselves, is becoming more difficult.Climate change will not only generate warmer and drier conditions across southern Europe, it will also begin to change other dynamic factors.Faster and more volatile wind systems, for instance, will increase the challenge for fire management personnel to predict how blazes will behave. That puts the lives of emergency workers and civilians at greater risk.\"Picture a fire so fierce, so fast, and so unpredictable it seems alive, capable of reshaping the weather around it and leaping across kilometers in a heartbeat,\" said Antonio Lopez, an expert in wildfires at the University of Seville, Spain.",

India also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent and achieve net-zero emissions by 2070.According to the latest government data, India added a record 29.52 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity in 2024-25, taking total installed renewable energy (RE) capacity to 234.24 GW (excluding nuclear), up from 198.75 GW last year.Solar energy leads the charge, with installed capacity skyrocketing from just 2.82 GW in 2014 to 116.24 GW today, now accounting for nearly half of India's total RE capacity.Wind power follows at 51.67 GW, while large and small hydro contribute 54.72 GW combined. Biopower has also grown to 11.59 GW over the past decade.India now ranks 4th globally in total RE capacity, 3rd in solar power, and 4th in wind energy, boasting the world's fastest-growing renewable program.The clean energy surge has been powered by a suite of ambitious government reforms and programs.The PM-Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana, with a Rs 75,021 crore outlay, aims to provide free solar electricity to one crore households.As of August 14, 2025, over 17.24 lakh households have benefitted, with subsidies worth Rs 9,841.77 crore released. The scheme also introduced Model Solar Villages to promote decentralised clean power at the grassroots level.In agriculture, the PM-KUSUM scheme has installed over 8.53 lakh solar pumps, replacing diesel-powered systems and cutting an estimated 6.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.Beyond solar, India is expanding in wind, hydro, bioenergy, green hydrogen, and nuclear power. Offshore wind projects, backed by a Rs 7,453 crore viability gap funding scheme, are set to add 1 GW capacity off Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.The National Green Hydrogen Mission, with a Rs 19,744 crore budget, targets 5 million metric tonnes (MMT) annual production by 2030, along with 125 GW of new RE, Rs 8 lakh crore in investments, and 6 lakh jobs. Hydrogen hubs have been identified in Kandla, Paradip, and Tuticorin.In the nuclear sector, operational capacity has grown from 4,780 MW in 2014 to 8,780 MW across 25 reactors, with a remarkable 87 per cent plant load factor in 2024-25. Ten new reactors are already functional, and capacity is set to increase tenfold by 2047.\"The result is a virtuous cycle: local manufacturing creates jobs and resilience, competitive tariffs make clean energy affordable, and inclusive programs bring every citizen into the transition. As we look ahead to 2030 and beyond, India is not just meeting global commitments -- it is setting a new template for how a nation can grow, decarbonise, and remain self-reliant. In the journey from energy dependence to energy leadership, the momentum is unmistakable, and the destination is clear: an Atmanirbhar Bharat, powered by its own clean, green energy,\" the government said today, in a factsheet.With five years gained on its clean energy target, India is now firmly on track to meet, and potentially exceed, its 500 GW non-fossil capacity goal by 2030, positioning itself as a decisive force in the global fight against climate change.

Notable successes include the reintroduction of black grouse to the North Yorkshire Moors, northern England, and the return of the large marsh grasshopper to the Norfolk Broads in east England after an 85-year absence. Despite the achievements, the chair of Natural England Tony Juniper warned more needed to be done. \"A rising number of nature recovery projects, both large and small, are making a huge difference up and down the country,\" he said in the press release.\"We know we can turn round species decline and improve ecosystems with the right targeted actions, the drive and the funding. But time is running out fast,\" he added.Juniper called for more projects, more volunteers and more investment, particularly from the private sector.",

        "input": "Talks on forging a landmark treaty to combat the scourge of plastic pollution were stumbling Saturday, with progress slow and countries wildly at odds on how far the proposed agreement should go.The negotiations, which opened on Tuesday, have four working days left to strike a legally-binding instrument that would tackle the growing problem choking the environment.In a blunt mid-way assessment, talks chair Luis Vayas Valdivieso warned the 184 countries negotiating at the United Nations that they had to get shifting to get a deal.\"Progress made has not been sufficient,\" Vayas told delegates.\"A real push to achieve our common goal is needed,\" the Ecuadoran diplomat said, adding that Thursday was not a just deadline but \"a date by which we must deliver.\"Some articles still have unresolved issues and show little progress towards reaching a common understanding,\" Vayas lamented.The key fracture is between countries that want to focus on waste management and others who want a more ambitious treaty that also cuts production and eliminates use of the most toxic chemicals.And with the talks relying on finding consensus, it has become a game of brinkmanship.A diplomatic source told reporters that many informal meetings had been scrambled together for Sunday's day off to try and break the deadlock.\"If nothing changes, we won't get there,\" the source added.Battle of the bracketsCountries have reconvened in Geneva after the failure of the supposedly fifth and final round of negotiations in Busan, South Korea in 2024.After four days of talks, the draft text has ballooned from 22 to 35 pages -- with the number of brackets in the text going up near five-fold to almost 1,500 as countries insert a blizzard of conflicting wishes and ideas.The talks are mandated to look at the full life cycle of plastic, from production to pollution, but some countries are unhappy with such a wide scope.Kuwait spoke up for the so-called Like-Minded Group -- a nebulous cluster of mostly oil-producing nations which rejects production limits and wants to focus on treating waste.\"Let us agree on what we can agree. Consensus must be the basis of all our decisions,\" Kuwait insisted.Nudging in the same direction, Saudi Arabia, speaking for the Arab Group, said the responsible way ahead was to start considering what bits of the text \"may not make it to the final outcome due to irreconcilable divergence\".But given how little is truly agreed on, Uruguay warned that consensus \"cannot be used as a justification to not achieve our objectives\".Eirik Lindebjerg, global plastics adviser for the World Wide Fund for Nature, told AFP that the Like-Minded Group's proposal was \"another attempt to make it a waste management agreement\", and to stifle talks on reducing the amount of plastic in circulation.Path through the fogThe UN Environment Programme is hosting the talks and swiftly called a press conference after the stock-take session.UNEP executive director Inger Andersen said a deal was \"really within our grasp, even though today it might not look so\".\"Despite the fog of negotiations I'm really encouraged,\" she told reporters, insisting: \"There is a pathway to success.\"Vayas added: \"We need to accelerate. We need a better rhythm in this and we need to also work in such a way that it will be clear that we will deliver by the end.\"Afterwards, Bjorn Beeler, executive director at IPEN, a global network aimed at limiting toxic chemicals, told AFP: \"This whole process has not been able to take decisions and is still collecting ideas. We're sleepwalking towards a cliff and if we don't wake up, we're falling off.\"'Profits from poisoning'Plastic pollution is so ubiquitous that microplastics have been found on the highest mountain peaks, in the deepest ocean trench and scattered throughout almost every part of the human body.More than 400 million tonnes of plastic are produced globally each year, half of which is for single-use items.Plastic production is set to triple by 2060.Panama's negotiator Juan Monterrey Gomez took the floor to slam those countries wanting to stop the treaty from encompassing the entire life cycle of plastic.He said microplastics \"are in our blood, in our lungs and in the first cry of a new-born child. Our bodies are living proof of a system that profits from poisoning us\". \"We cannot recycle our way out of this crisis.\"",

        "input": "Tropical bird populations have plummeted not only due to deforestation but also extreme heat attributable to climate change, according to a study published on Monday in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. Intensifying temepratures caused a 25-38 percent reduction in tropical bird populations between 1950 and 2020, compared to a scenario without manmade global warming, scientists based in Europe and Australia reported. \"The findings are pretty stark,\" lead author Maximilian Kotz, a researcher at the National Supercomputing Centre in Barcelona and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), told AFP.Bird populations in the tropics now face 30 days of heat extremes per year compared to three per year in the mid-20th century, he noted. \"This has major consequences for how we think about biodiversity conservation,\" Kotz said by email. \"Protecting pristine habitats is crucial, but without dealing with climate change it won't be enough for birds.\"Nearly half of all bird species are found in biodiversity-rich tropical regions. These often colourful animals perform essential services for ecosystems, such as dispersing plant seeds. Invasive species another threatBut birds living in these regions may already be \"close to the limits\" of their tolerance to high temperatures, which can cause heatstroke (hyperthermia) or dehydration. The overview study does not provide figures for individual species, but earlier literature is rich with examples of the devastating impact of rising temperatures.One documented the heat-related decline of birds in Panama, including the king quetzal, the red-crested quetzal, the two-coloured kingfisher and the aurora trogon. Another study published in 2017 showed how some tropical hummingbirds are now forced to seek shade to regulate their temperature in extreme heat, cutting into the amount of time they can spend searching for life-sustaining nectar. Extreme heat waves, which are becoming more frequent, represent a far greater threat than increases in average temperatures or rainfall, another result of human-induced climate change. Up to now, it has been assumed that the decline in bird populations worldwide was due mainly to other well-identified factors, especially habitat loss, pesticide use, hunting, and invasive species, especially snakes that snack on bird eggs and mosquitos carrying avian malaria. But the new findings \"challenge the view that direct human pressures have so far been the dominant driver of impacts on bird populations compared to climate change in tropical regions,\" according to the authors. To reach this conclusion, they analysed observational data from more than 3,000 bird populations around the world and used statistical modelling to isolate the effects of extreme weather from other factors.The findings help complete the picture of tropical bird decline, noted Aimee Van Tatenhove, a post-doctoral fellow at Cornell University's Center for Avian Population Studies who was not involved in the study.\"Deforestation has an obvious impact -- trees are cut and habitat is destroyed,\" she told AFP. \"We need long-term datasets like the authors used to understand how extreme temperatures impact avian populations.\"\"This study is an important reminder that we need to continue examining different causes of population declines and apply those findings to conservation initiatives,\" she continued.",

Yes,\" said Environment Minister Nadjiba Djilali during the cleanup campaign, adding there were no records of the plant causing allergies.Researcher Bahbah said stopping its proliferation was \"unfortunately impossible at this stage\".She said the plant reproduces at a high rate, both sexually and asexually.The species can reproduce through fragmentation, meaning new individual algae can develop from fragmented pieces of other Rugulopteryx okamurae algae.The algae spread mainly by clinging to the hulls of boats, and the Mediterranean's moderate temperature favours the seaweed's fast reproduction.\"We are going to fight it,\" said Fella Zaboudj, a state engineer in marine sciences, adding that researchers were monitoring its spread, development and evolution.Zaboudj said research was also underway to determine whether the algae could be repurposed as fertiliser.",

Ireland's wind energy sector has long been touted as full of potential. AI image BANGOR: On Ireland's blustery western seaboard, researchers are gleefully flying giant kites, not for fun but in the hope of generating renewable electricity and sparking a \"revolution\" in wind energy.\"We use a kite to capture the wind and a generator at the bottom of it that captures the power,\" Padraic Doherty of Kitepower, the Dutch firm behind the venture, told AFP. At its test site in operation since September 2023 near the small town of Bangor Erris, the team transports the vast 60-square-metre (645,000-square-feet) kite from a hangar across the lunar-like bogland to a generator. The kite is then attached by a cable tether to the machine and acts like a \"yo-yo or fishing reel\", Doherty said.\"It gets cast out and flies up, the tether pulls it back in, over and over again, creating energy,\" he said, testing the kite's ropes and pulleys before a flight.The sparsely populated spot near the stormy Atlantic coast is the world's first designated airborne renewable energy test site. And although the idea is still small in scale, it could yet prove to be a mighty plan as Ireland seeks to cut its reliance on fossil fuels such as oil and gas.\"We are witnessing a revolution in wind energy,\" said Andrei Luca, operations head at Kitepower, a zero-emissions energy solutions spin-off from the Delft University of Technology.\"It took nearly 25 years for wind turbines to evolve from 30-kilowatt prototypes to megawatt scale, and decades to offshore wind farms we see today,\" he added.The system flies autonomously, driven by software developed at the university in the Netherlands, but Doherty acts as the kite's \"pilot\" on the ground, monitoring its flight path for efficiency. The kite flies up around 400 metres (1,300 feet) and reels in to about 190 metres, generating around 30 kilowatts for storage.The force spins \"like a dynamo on a bike\", Doherty said, adding that \"it generates up to two and a half tonnes of force through each turn\".The electricity is stored in batteries, similar to solar photovoltaic systems, with the kite currently able to fully charge a 336-kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery.\"That's a meaningful amount of energy, sufficient for powering a remote outpost, a small island, polar station, or even a construction site,\" Luca said.\"Add additional kites and we can power a bigger island.\"'Mobile, flexible'According to Doherty, a chief advantage of the kite system is its flexibility and swift start-up capability.\"We can set up in 24 hours and can bring it anywhere, it's super mobile, and doesn't need expensive, time- and energy-consuming turbine foundations to be built,\" he said. A kite system is \"way less invasive on the landscape (than wind turbines), produces clean energy and doesn't need a supply chain of fuel to keep running\", Luca added.During January's Storm Eowyn, which caused widespread and long-lasting power outages in Ireland, the system showed its value in Bangor Erris, according to Luca. \"Paired with a battery, it provided uninterrupted electricity before, during and after the storm,\" he said. Ireland's wind energy sector has long been touted as full of potential.But progress on large-scale delivery of onshore and offshore turbines has been held up by planning delays and electricity grid capacity constraints.The Irish government has set ambitious targets for offshore wind energy to deliver 20 gigawatts of energy by 2040 and at least 37 gigawatts by 2050.In 2024, Irish wind farms provided around a third of the country's electricity according to Wind Energy Ireland (WEI), a lobby group for the sector. This compares to the UK, where, according to trade association RenewableUK, wind energy from the country's combined wind farms first reached 20 gigawatts in November 2022.The ability of airborne wind energy (AWE) systems to harness high-altitude winds with relatively low infrastructure requirements \"makes them particularly suitable for remote, offshore or mobile applications,\" Mahdi Salari, an AWE researcher at University College Cork, told AFP.But he said Kitepower would face challenges on \"regulation, safety, and system reliability\". Such technology however could plug gaps in places where \"land availability, costs or logistical constraints hinder the deployment of traditional wind turbines\", Salari said.By the 2030s, he said: \"I expect AWE to contribute meaningfully to diversified, flexible and distributed renewable energy networks\".Discover stories of India\u2019s leading eco-innovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025",

Mehar\u2019s custom-engineered drone reached this remarkable milestone in an astonishing 0.91 seconds, a feat that not only demonstrates his technical prowess but also sets a new benchmark in the rapidly evolving world of drone technology.Mehar\u2019s journey to this achievement has been anything but straightforward. His fascination with drones began in 8th grade, and this passion has only deepened over the years. With a keen interest in pushing technological boundaries, Mehar embarked on a months-long project to build a drone capable of unparalleled vertical acceleration.\u201cI\u2019ve always been fascinated by the idea of pushing the limits of what drones can do,\u201d Mehar explained. \u201cBut breaking a world record wasn\u2019t just about the end result; it was about the process. I wanted to prove that current technology could achieve something extraordinary, but the path to get there was filled with challenges.\u201dThe project required Mehar to design, test, and refine multiple drone prototypes. \u201cThere were moments when I felt like I was chasing an impossible dream,\u201d Mehar recalled. \u201cI went through countless designs, and many of them failed during testing. Some drones crashed so badly that I had no choice but to go back to the drawing board and start from scratch. Each crash was a setback, but it also sparked new ideas and innovations.\u201dUndeterred by the setbacks, Mehar poured his energy into creating a drone that was not only fast but also aerodynamically optimized. \u201cI spent countless hours on CAD software, meticulously designing and tweaking each component. The goal was to make the drone as streamlined as possible, which led me to shape it like a rocket. This design wasn\u2019t just about aesthetics; it was about reducing drag and maximizing speed.\u201dMehar\u2019s dedication to his craft paid off in spectacular fashion. \u201cEvery failure taught me something valuable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt forced me to think creatively and to consider every detail, from the materials used to the weight distribution of the drone. The process was grueling, but it was also incredibly rewarding to see my ideas take flight\u2014literally.\u201dThis record-breaking achievement is more than just a personal triumph for Mehar; it has significant implications for the future of drone technology. \u201cThe possibilities are endless,\u201d Mehar mused. \u201cHigh-speed vertical acceleration could revolutionize everything from emergency response to space exploration. This isn\u2019t just about setting a record; it\u2019s about opening doors to new innovations and applications.\u201dMehar\u2019s groundbreaking work has already begun to inspire others in the drone community and beyond. \u201cI hope this accomplishment encourages other young innovators to push their own boundaries,\u201d he said. \u201cTechnology is advancing rapidly, and there\u2019s so much potential waiting to be unlocked. I\u2019m excited to see where we can go from here.\u201dAs Mehar looks ahead, the sky is truly the limit. With his record-breaking drone, he has not only made history but also set the stage for future breakthroughs in drone technology. And for this young innovator, this is just the beginning of an exciting journey into the future of flight.Disclaimer: Content produced by Mediawire on Behalf of Shweta Singh",

Doordarshan said that the morning aarti offered to Ram Lalla will be telecast live on DD National every morning from 6:30 am.The national broadcaster said that the decision to telecast the morning aarti live every day was taken with the aim of connecting devotees of Lord Ram, especially after the temple was inaugurated less than two months ago in a grand ceremony and everyone can't visit the temple in person. The Aarti will be telecast simultaneously on DD\u2019s YouTube channel also.Secondly, the decision was taken because the Trust doesn\u2019t have logistical arrangements as of now for a live broadcast. Therefore, DD will be posting a two-three-member crew on the temple premises for the coverage of the daily ritual.DD's announcement to telecast the Aarti live for 30 minutes every morning comes after getting the go-ahead from the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust for the same.

        "input": "Microsoft discontinues Surface Duo smartphones but files a patent for a new foldable device with a single hinge system called 'spine cover plate'. The design aims to eliminate the hinge crease and reduce the device's thickness while offering added benefits and durability. However, its practicality remains uncertain. Microsoft did not get the success it was anticipating with its Android-powered Surface Duo-series smartphones. The company has discontinued the lineup after the Duo 2. But, this does not mean the company has stopped trying. A new patent application filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29, reveals that the company is working on another foldable or dual-display mobile device.The patent application describes the company\u2019s take on the foldable smartphone concept with single hinge technology called \u201cspine cover plate\u201d.Next Microsoft smartphones could feature a Galaxy Z Fold-like designAccording to the patent application, the phone could feature a \u201cflexible display\u201d in a bookstyle design similar to Galaxy Z Fold decies. However, the entire focus is on the spine cover plate mechanism which is aimed at protecting the single-hinge system of the device by covering the structural element. The differentiating factor between the regular hinge and Microsoft\u2019s design is that the spine cover adjusts automatically during the opening and closing of the phone to prevent any unnecessary gaps around the hinge to protect it from dust as well as water. Currently, Samsung\u2019s design offers an IPX8 rating which makes their foldables water-resistant only.The patent further mentions that the new hinge mechanism could allow Microsoft to eliminate the hinge crease less visible than the current options available in the market. Moreover, Microsoft has also mentioned techniques that could allow them to reduce the overall thickness of the foldable smartphone by allowing the spine cover plate to move closer to the device\u2019s hinge when folded. \u201cBy retracting the spine cover plate toward the central spine as the first display-supporting frame and the second display-supporting frame are rotated into a face-to-face orientation, the width of the folded computing device is reduced, thereby enabling easier and more comfortable handling of the device, such as with one hand,\u201d Microsoft noted in the patent.Interesting idea, but practicality is a question markThe entire smartphone market is searching for a way to eliminate the foldable crease from their smartphones. Some brands have already implemented the water-drop folding mechanism to reduce it, but there\u2019s nothing like a crease-free foldable out there. Apart from that, the durability quotient of foldable is also important considering all the movable parts these phones have. That said, adding another layer or a movable part on top of the entire foldable mechanism does not appear like a wise move despite the added benefits and durability Microsoft has explained in the patent application.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Bobby Kotick, the former head of Activision Blizzard, is reportedly considering buying TikTok, as the app could be banned in the United States. The Wall Street Journal reports that Kotick has talked to ByteDance, the company that owns TikTok, about buying the app, which could cost hundreds of billions of dollars.This comes as US lawmakers introduce a new bill that would make ByteDance sell TikTok within six months or stop it from being available in US app stores.President Joe Biden has said he would approve the bill if it passes in Congress.The Wall Street Journal report adds that Kotick, the head of OpenAI, Sam Altman, discussed teaming up to buy TikTok at a dinner last week. Kotick's interest in TikTok follows a rough end to his 30 years leading Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft acquired last year. The company faced a lawsuit saying it allowed sexual harassment and discrimination under Kotick's leadership. The Wall Street Journal also said Kotick knew about bad behaviour and didn't tell the board everything. Kotick was accused of harassment, but Activision Blizzard said the report was \"misleading.\"Lawmakers are worried about data privacy and TikTok's ties to China. US President Biden, whose administration has banned the app already on state devices, has expressed his support for banning the app in the US. However, former President Donald Trump, who once wanted to ban TikTok, has changed his mind, saying a ban would help TikTok's rivals, like Facebook and YouTube. As the bill against TikTok gains support, the app has asked its American users to speak up for it, sending messages telling users to call their representatives. The bill, which passed a committee last week, is expected to be approved when the House votes on Wednesday.

Reason is said to be delay in the delivery of two supercomputers by the French company to Indian weather forecasting institutes. According to a report in news agency PTI, the Earth Sciences Ministry had ordered two supercomputers worth $100 million from French firm Eviden, of the Atos Group, last year to enhance the computing capabilities of its institutions -- the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM).\"I am more upset because the target we set was December. The Union Cabinet had already approved purchasing the supercomputer. We have only four petaflop capacity. We want to install up to 18 petaflop capacity,\" Rijiju told PTI in a video interview.He said that the French company ran into some financial trouble and wanted the government to make payment to its subsidiary.Minister says that the delay is causing him \"worry\"Rijiju said that the delay has caused him lots of worry as the company has overshot the timeline. \"But I think we will sort it out soon,\" he said, adding that the government wanted to be \"very correct in our position legally\".\"We are ready to release the money because we want the machine immediately. The only problem is the amount is not small. So if we pay now, if the company is bankrupt or something happens, who will bail out,\" the minister said.Rijiju further added that the government was taking some steps to speed up the delivery of the supercomputer but did not elaborate. \"But I hope the French government will also intervene because we have a good understanding and a very good relationship with the French government.\"Since it is a high-cost equipment, we want to ensure that the transaction happens duly and properly,\" he said.\"From outside, everything's ready. It is only the problem with the main company. They want us to pay their subsidiary. We will pay only to a company whom we have entered an MoU with,\" Rijiju said.The supercomputing system, based on Eviden's BullSequana XH2000, is said to have a combined power capacity of up to 21.3 petaflops.Supercomputer at IITMThe supercomputer at the Pune-based IITM will provide 13 petaflops of computing power for atmosphere and climate research.

        "input": "The Bar Council of India has imposed a three-year moratorium on new law colleges due to concerns about declining educational standards and an oversupply of graduates. This pause aims to allow for audits, stricter regulations, and curriculum reforms to improve the quality of legal education. Exceptions may be considered for underserved regions, signalling a calibrated approach to address systemic issues. Law College Dreams: A Bright Future The Bar Council of India (BCI), the statutory body that regulates legal education and practice, has recently imposed a three-year moratorium on the establishment of new law colleges and centres of legal education (CLEs). India\u2019s legal education has long resembled an overcrowded courtroom: Too many petitioners, too few advocates of substance, and an avalanche of paper that often hides the paucity of substance. At first glance, the decision may appear draconian in a country with soaring demand for legal education. But scratch beneath the surface, and the move reflects a deeper crisis in India\u2019s legal training ecosystem\u2014one that regulators are keen to fix before allowing further expansion.The problem of quantity over qualityEstimates suggest that India today has over 1,700 law colleges, producing approximately 80,000\u201390,000 graduates each year. In theory, this should be a celebration of democracy, of access, of justice made tangible through a wider pool of practitioners. In practice, the majority of these institutions are barely more than signboards with classrooms. They offer skeletal libraries, non-existent moot courts, and faculty that too often treat teaching as a reluctant part-time job.Multiple surveys by the BCI and independent commissions have revealed that a large share of law colleges operate more as \u201cdegree shops\u201d than serious centres of learning. They lack full-time qualified faculty, libraries are skeletal, and clinical legal training is almost absent. The result: Graduates who hold a degree but are often ill-prepared for practice in courts, corporate firms, or public service.Employment mismatch: The graduate glutThe crisis is not just academic but also economic. For every clutch of graduates from National Law Universities who step into gleaming corporate boardrooms, there are thousands more who wander from chambers to district courts, struggling to find cases, or worse, jobs that match neither their degree nor their debt. The glut of unemployable law graduates has become the profession\u2019s open secret.The BCI has been repeatedly criticised for allowing proliferation of sub-standard colleges, leading to an oversupply of graduates with limited practical skills. By announcing a freeze, the regulator is signalling that it wants to correct the imbalance between supply and demand.Using the pause to raise standardsThe moratorium is also about buying time to implement reforms. During this three-year window, the BCI aims to:Audit existing colleges to ensure compliance with infrastructure, faculty, and curriculum standards.Tighten recognition norms, making it harder for institutions to survive without meeting minimum requirements.Push for practical training, including moot courts, internships, and clinical legal education.Align curricula with contemporary needs\u2014cyber law, arbitration, AI and law\u2014so that graduates are better prepared for modern practice.In short, the BCI wants to ensure that the next expansion of law colleges is accompanied by higher academic rigour and professional credibility, rather than unchecked growth.A history of oversight failuresThis is not the first time the legal education sector has been under the scanner. Back in the 1990s, the Yash Pal Committee and the National Knowledge Commission flagged concerns about the proliferation of substandard professional colleges\u2014in law, engineering, and management alike. Despite multiple warnings, regulatory loopholes allowed a surge of law colleges in semi-urban and rural areas, many without the means to deliver quality education.The current moratorium is therefore an acknowledgement of past regulatory failures. It reflects the BCI\u2019s recognition that before more licences are granted, existing institutions must be cleaned up and strengthened.The broader context: Lack of trust in the legal systemIndia\u2019s judiciary is already battling a credibility crisis with innumerable pending cases, long delays, and concerns about access to justice. In this context, poorly trained lawyers only worsen the problem. The moratorium thus serves a symbolic as well as practical purpose: Sending a message that legal education cannot be diluted without damaging the very justice system it feeds into.Interestingly, the BCI has kept the door slightly ajar. The Council has said that in backward or underserved regions, exceptions may be considered if there is a strong case for opening a new institution. This indicates that the moratorium is not an absolute freeze, but a carefully calibrated pause.Recent developmentsWhile new colleges are blocked, existing institutions are seeing active regulatory engagement:CNLU\u2019s 3-Year LLB Course: Chanakya National Law University (Patna) has been permitted to start a three-year LLB programme from 2025\u201326, making it the fourth NLU to do so. This suggests that the BCI is still encouraging programme diversification within reputed universities.Gujarat Colleges Back in Admissions: Fourteen grant-in-aid law colleges in Gujarat, previously excluded for non-compliance, have been reinstated into the admission process after the state government cleared dues and promised reforms. They must now strictly follow faculty and infrastructure norms.The road aheadThe moratorium is not merely about stopping new colleges; it is about resetting the standards of legal education in India. If the BCI uses these three years to enforce accountability, upgrade curricula, and weed out non-performing institutions, the long-term benefits could be significant.However, if this pause ends without meaningful reform, it risks being yet another cosmetic measure\u2014leaving students to bear the brunt of a system that churns out degrees without delivering real opportunity.Ready to navigate global policies?

        "input": "Effective note-taking is a crucial skill for students, emphasizing active listening, processing information, and using techniques like the Cornell method and visual thinking. Experts recommend revisiting notes within 24 hours to reinforce memory and transforming notes into personal dialogues with questions and insights. Ultimately, good notes spark curiosity and deepen understanding, making knowledge truly one's own. 7 effective note-taking techniques that genuinely improve comprehension, retention and academic performance (Image: Pexels) If there is one essential skill that students should master in schools and universities, it is the art of taking good notes. Notes that are not copied and pasted from professors' slides, not even the ones that we scribble on a notebook and later become difficult to comprehend. The \"Art of Taking Notes\" that could not only be understood, but also remembered and used later for learning purposes. Effective note-taking is not just recording facts or copying from textbook to note format. Most notebooks are summaries of textbooks that are never looked at, or hardly ever. The whole purpose of note taking is that it is something you will revisit and want to revisit it. So many notes are taken but never made use of.A recent 2025 Cornell University study made a comparison of physics courses where students who were trained in note-taking and motivated to use their self-prepared notes, performed better in exams than those with no structured note-taking approach. The study highlighted how strategic note-taking boosts engagement and learning outcomes.As Gen Z is a digital generation, they are more comfortable using their screens than paper. Those old spiral notebooks and registers have been replaced by laptops, iPads and phones. Technology is good and has made life easier but the issue is that taking notes can become a mindless typing process and the notes are often not even revisited. The long audio recordings contain huge amounts of information but the question is: are students processing it?Writing notes by hand boosts retention and keeps you more engaged than typing. According to a 2020 study, Using voice note-taking to promote learners' conceptual understanding, taking notes via voice input \"leads to a higher conceptual understanding of the text and encourages more elaborate and comprehensive notes.\" The researchers found that instead of typing, it was voice-based note-taking that prompted deeper processing and richer, more comprehensive note generation. This suggests that leveraging speech input can boost conceptual learning in digital environments.The reality is, it doesn't matter what medium students are using for taking notes. Effective note-taking is all about what and how one thinks while writing. Great notes do more than capture information, they spark thinking. They spark reflection and connection. They help you understand better, not just remember facts which you may as well underline in the original text and you will likely recall better as you look at your textbook more often than a note book.Typing may make us less able to recall the very information we were just working with later, according to a study published in Psychological Science. Students at Princeton University took notes on a TED Talk where half used laptops and the other half used a pen and paper. The laptop-using group seemed to transcribe the talk instead of ingesting it (this was found via testing of both groups later). Each group was tested on what they had learned a week later and the findings revealed that those who wrote in longhand had better memory recall. Here are some effective note-taking techniques by experts. Listen first, write laterDon't be in a hurry to jot down whatever you are listening to. Don\u2019t be that kid who rushes to write everything. In an interview with TOI, Dr CP Rashmi, Associate Professor (Head of the Institute) Amity School of Communication at Amity University in Bangalore, advised, \u201cPause first and concentrate on listening. Listen, understand, and then write down notes in your own words. Humans remember processed information better than copied information.\u201dUse the Cornell methodSplit the page (paper or digital screen) into three sections. Dr Rashmi suggested, \u201cMake a narrow column on the left-hand side where you can jot down questions, prompts and keywords that will help you summarise your thoughts. The right section will be used for writing notes and the bottom section is where one will write a summary of the notes that would come in handy before exams.\u201d This structure of writing notes not only helps one review the notes but also condenses the information. This system enables the 5 R's of note-taking: record, reduce, recite, reflect and review while the process helps transform raw lecture content into clear, retained knowledge.Visualise your learningVisual thinking helps in memorising content better. Dr Rashmi opined, \u201cOne can start with the main topic in the centre of the page and then branch out into subtopics and ideas, connecting them like flow charts or graphs. The digital generation can also use many freely available apps for the same purpose. These roughly made sketches help you understand, learn and see the bigger picture.\u201dPen and paper: Your brain\u2019s best friendThere\u2019s something quietly powerful about the old-school pen and notebook. Dr Rashmi pointed out, \u201cWriting on paper with a pen slows you down just enough to think about each word, giving your brain time to absorb ideas instead of letting them slide past.\u201dSketchnoting boosts focus and visual memory retention (Image: Pexels)Psychologists have found that writing by hand activates areas of the brain linked to memory, focus and even creativity. It is meditation for the brain as it calms the mind. While research shows the anxiety that digital media can cause after hours of scrolling, writing is almost meditative, your mind feels calmer. Dr Rashmi said, \u201cThe act of holding a pen and writing each letter can feel grounding, almost like telling your brain, \u201cThis matters. Pay attention\u201d and that mental pause is often what turns information into lasting understanding.\u201dUse mind mapsAids like mind maps can turn scattered ideas into clear, visual networks. They give away links and patterns that straight lists often hide. Dr. Sunita Gandhi, Educator, Researcher, Innovator, Author and Founder of Global Education and Training Institute (GETI) and Dignity Education Vision International (DEVI Sansthan), explained, \u201cRestating and better still making a diagram or a mind map, or a flow chart or a graphic organiser, especially what you have learned in your own words after a lesson, makes you actively process the content, which helps it stay in your memory, and you may end up using it for revision.\u201dMake task cardsThe one type of notetaking that is especially useful is a task card. One side is a question or a topic, on the other are bullet points, formulae, or a graphic summarising the answers or the topic. Dr. Gandhi asserted, \u201cIt is better still that they are on the front and back side of a notebook, or even on cards, an A4 sheet in half or quarters. You can pick it up every evening for 10 minutes, read the question or be reminded of a topic, you try to recall what might be on the back side, then turn over to see if you got it right. You may even attempt a full question in your rough notebook, then review if you get it right. Once you know you have mastered a few cards, put them in a new pouch like a ziplock bag, and revisit them less often, say once a month, or near an exam.\u201dHave conversations with to yourselfAccording to Dr. Gandhi, the best notes are the dialogues with yourself. They capture your questions, insights and even moments of doubt. This gives them life and personality, rather than leaving them as dry passive records.Though there are many more techniques, the golden rule that one should always follow is to review the notes within 24 hours. By revisiting the notes on the same day or the next day, you reinforce the memory while the information in your brain is still fresh. This process helps in retaining the information for a longer period.Dr Rashmi shared, \"In my 20 years of teaching, I\u2019ve seen students with average abilities outshine toppers, simply because they knew how to take and use their notes well. Good notes aren\u2019t just an academic tool; they\u2019re your personal library of understanding. Whether you\u2019re tapping on a tablet or scribbling in a diary, remember: note-taking isn\u2019t about storing words. It\u2019s about making the knowledge truly yours.\"Good notes spark curiosity. They invite you to return, review and build on them. A note that is never revisited is a missed opportunity and worse, as it is loads of wasted time in making those notes in the first place. The simple act of writing does not take it to long term memory. Re-reading at intervals, the same day, a week later, before a test, strengthens memory and understanding. What matters is that your notes serve you. They help you connect ideas and deepen understanding and those you keep revisiting and keep learning alive.Ready to navigate global policies?

He cautioned against assuming a direct causal link between Washingtons and Beijings relations with New Delhi.  NEW DELHI External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said that Indias relationship with China should not be viewed through the prism of New Delhis ties with the United States. Speaking at The Economic Times World Leaders Forum 2025 Jaishankar said What I want you to understand is its not black and white. Its not that something has happened with America so therefore immediately something has happened with China. There are different timelines of different lengths on different problems. He added that it would be a mistaken analysis to assume events with Washington automatically dictated New Delhis stance with Beijing. There is a flow of that relationship. There are other relationships but dont make this connection so tight dont make it a causality. Thats not the reality he said.The ministers comments come against the backdrop of trade tensions with Washington after the Trump administration sharply raised tariffs on Indian goods in response to New Delhis purchase of Russian oil. Jaishankar said India remained committed to protecting its farmers and small producers calling the tariff hike unjustified and unreasonable. He argued the issue had been mischaracterised as an oil dispute pointing out that larger importers such as China and European nations had not faced similar criticism. The same arguments that have been used to target India have not been applied to the largest oil importer which is China and have not been applied to the largest LNG importer which is the European nations he said.Jaishankars remarks came soon after his visit to Moscow where he met President Vladimir Putin and senior Russian officials and ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modis scheduled trip to Japan and China later this month for the SCO summit.

He again rejected claims of US mediation in the postOperation Sindoor ceasefire stressing it was a direct IndiaPakistan deal and warned opposition against compromising farmers interests or Indias strategic autonomy. Dr S Jaishankar File photo NEW DELHI External affairs minister Dr S Jaishankar on Saturday took a sharp swipe at US and Pakistan saying both countries had a habit of overlooking history.Speaking at Economic Times World Leaders Forum the foreign minister cited the 2011 US raid in Abbottabad that killed Osama bin Laden. He reminded that it was the same Pakistan that had sheltered the 911 attacker.They have a history with each other and they have a history of overlooking their history. It is the same military that went into Abbottabad in Pakistan and found who there Dr Jaishankar asked.He further underlined that Indias foreign policy was guided by longterm confidence rather than shortterm politics of convenience. When countries focus on the politics of convenience they keep trying to do this or that. But I always keep in mind the larger structural strengths of the relationship and the confidence that comes from it. At the end of the day I know my strengths and I know the importance of my relationships he said.The EAM also reiterated that US didnt mediate between India and Pakistan for the ceasefire after the conflict following Indias Operation Sindoor.Since 1970s for more than 50 years now theres a national consensus in this country that we do not accept mediation in our relations with Pakistan he said.He further explained that calls from the US and other countries were made during Operation Sindoor but clarified that these were routine diplomatic exchanges not negotiations. Every American phone call I had is there on my X account he said emphasising that the settlement was the result of direct talks between India and Pakistan and pushing back against the narrative by opposition and US president Donald Trump that US negotiated the ceasefire.The external affairs minister also used the occasion to attack the opposition saying that India was also resisting external pressures to protect its national economic interests.When it comes to trade and the interests of farmers when it comes to our strategic autonomy when it comes to opposing mediation this government is very clear. Our positions are firm he said warning that If anybody disagrees with us please tell the people of India that you are not prepared to defend the interests of farmers. Please tell the people of India that you dont value strategic autonomy. We do. We will do whatever we have to do to maintain it.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The real way forward he stressed was through cooperation and respect. The relationship has been strained in recent weeks with the Trump administration set to impose secondary sanctions on India for its oil trade with Russia.We are concerned. This struggle between President Trump and PM Modi is unfortunate. It seems to me its a reflection that great nations dont necessarily exhibit greatness by giving people ultimatums all the time Kerry said at the ET World Leaders Forum. He expressed hope India and the US would resolve their trade dispute noting that India had offered to place almost 60 of goods at zero tariff. Thats a big shift. We need to get to a better place faster he said.Kerry who served under President Obama appreciated Trumps peace efforts with Russian President Vladimir Putin but said Putin had no intention of ending the war. He sees gains on the ground disarray in the West and Trumps wavering stance on staying power he said contrasting it with Bidens firm support for Ukraine.Calling Russia a gas station with a lot of gas Kerry said its longrun economic prospects were bleak. He added that both Russias security concerns and Ukraines guarantees needed serious discussion. On Gaza Kerry said Israels current govt does not believe in a twostate solution which posed a big problem for the world. He also praised Indias ambitious renewable energy goals saying nuclear power must be part of the transition.",
        "output": "He urged countries to support clean energy and decarbonisation efforts.Kerry called for a global effort to fight climate change but said the Paris Agreement was a first step but needed to be strengthened. He said the pact failed to address the root causes like inequality, corruption, and climate chaos. He called for a new global pact to fight climate change.\n\n\nQuestion:What is the name of the initiative launched by India and the United States to fight climate change? \nOptions: \n[A] Paris Agreement  \n[B] United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  \n[C] Global Clean Energy Mission  \n[D] G20 Clean Energy Mission \nCorrect Answer: C [Global Clean Energy Mission]"

This advance brings Russian troops closer to Kostyantynivka a strategically important town on the route to Kramatorsk. Kramatorsk serves as a vital logistics hub for Ukrainian forces potentially disrupting supply lines if the advance continues. Representative Image AIgenerated  Russia on Saturday announced that its forces had captured two villages in Ukraines Donetsk region increasing military pressure as international efforts to end the conflict continue.Moscows defence ministry said on Telegram that its troops had taken control of Sredneye and KlebanByk.

        "input": "Berlins Mohrenstrasse a street with a racist name rooted in Germanys colonial past was slated to be renamed after Anton Wilhelm Amo the first Africanborn scholar to earn a European doctorate. Despite years of lobbying and legal battles residents initially blocked the change but the courts ultimately upheld the renaming. AP file photo  Decolonization does not happen by changing a few street names political scientist and human rights activist Joshua Kwesi Aikins told DW after it was announced on Friday that a central Berlin street will not have its racist name changed after all. The road had been slated to be renamed in honor of Anton Wilhelm Amo a Black German Enlightenment philosopher who in 1734 became the first Africaborn scholar to receive a European doctorate.That was in 2020. At the time the district council of BerlinMitte had approved the renaming but before it was implemented residents filed a lawsuit against it.But five years later in July this year the Higher Administrative Court of BerlinBrandenburg upheld a decision by the Berlin Administrative Court stating that residents have no basis to take legal action against the name change.Signs had already been installed and the change was to be officialized through a symbolic unveiling on Saturday August 23 which also marks International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition. Though the group Pro Mohrenstrae made a lastditch legal attempt to block the name change the BerlinBrandenburg court again upheld its ruling to allow for the name change.Dividing up Africa from BerlinSeveral civil society groups have lobbied for decades to change the name of Mohren or Moor Street respectfully referred to as MStrasse and the UBahn station of the same name.Moor in its Greek roots means dark or black but also stupid or primitive Aikins said.MStrasse runs through the old quarter of the former Prussian city steps away from the rebuilt Berlin Palace which oversaw colonial forays into Africa and near the former chancellors residence and venue for the 18841885 Berlin Conference.In the words of Berlinbased BritishUgandan writer Musa Okwonga the major European colonial powers that gathered for the conference discussed how they might divide up Africa. The conference kickstarted Germanys genocidal colonial rule in Namibia. The Mwords overt racist connotations further derive from the 18thcentury practice of bringing enslaved Africans to Germany as court moors to work as servants or entertain the Brandenburg electors and Prussian kings as musicians. The street name given at the beginning of the 18th century transports this racist experience of violence against Black people in Berlin to the present day wrote historian Christian Kopp of Decolonize BerlinMitte.These slaves were mostly brought from the BrandenburgPrussian colony in currentday Ghana then known as the Brandenburger Gold Coast which existed from 1682 to 1721.Who was Anton Wilhelm AmoAnton Wilhelm Amo himself was enslaved as a boy in Ghana and taken to Amsterdam around 1703. He was then gifted to the German Duke of BraunschweigWolfenbttel in 1707 the year MStrasse was named.Encouraged to study by the Duke who paid for his education Amo went on to become the first Africanborn scholar in Europe to complete a PhD in 1734.Despite Amos displacement he embraced his German identity while never forgetting his African heritage. Amos thesis in law at the University of Halle is lost but was titled The Rights of Blacks in Europe which looked at the legal rights of People of Color in the continent.It is said that Amo learned six languages. He later wrote a second doctoral thesis in philosophy that weighed in on philosopher Rene Descartes and his ideas about the duality between mind and body. He also taught classes at the universities in Halle and nearby Jena but made a meager living before returning to Ghana in 1747. The date of his death is unknown.Amo is remembered as the first philosopher of African origin in Germany yet this trailblazer has been largely erased from European intellectual history.The naming of AntonWilhelmAmoStrasse demands a greater appreciation of the scholars work as a philosopher and legal scholar and the professional context in which he worked wrote Anna Orinsky in the online journal EUIdeas. German and international historians philosophers and scholars of many other disciplines are called upon to analyse Amos work she added. But the renaming is also in honor of a symbol of Black resistance says AndreaVicky AmankwaaBirago a Berlinbased cultural scientist focused on decolonization across Germany and Ghana.This renaming signals a change in how we remember  placing Black history achievement and resilience at the center she wrote in August 2025 for internet publication Medium.The long journey to AntonWilhelmAmoStrasseThe MStrasse subway station was itself renamed in 1991 in the wake of reunification. It had previously been called OttoGrotewohlStrasse after a GDR politician.The use of the racist name was called out at the time by the pioneering Black German activist May Ayim a poet of Ghanaian descent who cofounded the Initiative of Black People in Germany in 1986 and edited the defining book Showing Our Colors AfroGerman Women Speak Out. Ayim pursued her efforts to reveal the coded racism in reunified Germany. In the 1990s she was outspoken in her opposition to the street name which in her view stood for the fact that Germanys Black community was not included in the countrys essentially white reunification process after the fall of the Berlin Wall.In 2010 a Kreuzberg riverfront was renamed after Ayim who died in 1996. It was one of the first acts of decolonization the shore having been named after Otto Friedrich von der Groeben who in the late 17th century founded the BrandenburgPrussian colony in Ghana.",
        "output": "The riverfront now bears the name of the city where the station was originally named after him. The renaming was officially approved by the Brandenburg government in 2021."

        "input": "Under President Trumps immigration policies the US is deporting migrants to African nations including Uganda Eswatini and South Sudan despite concerns over human rights and the capacity of these countries to host more refugees. These deals framed as temporary arrangements have sparked controversy and raised questions about the benefits for the host nations with Nigeria rejecting the proposal outright. AP file photo  US President Donald Trumps crackdown on illegal immigration is a cornerstone of his domestic policy forming part of his controversial campaign pledge to carry out the largest deportation operation in American history.Deporting those migrants to African countries however was not part of the original plan he announced when he ran for the presidency in 2024.But the US Department of Homeland Security said in June that thirdcountry deportations  i.e. sending undocumented migrants from the US to countries other than their own  were necessary to expel people so uniquely barbaric that their own countries wont take them back. Uganda has now become the latest country in East Africa to accept a deal with Washington pledging to take in a yet tobespecified number of migrants who do not qualify to remain in the United States.Alex Vines the head of the Africa Programme at Chatham House a renowned thinktank in London highlights that this agreement builds on schemes between the US with other African nations adopted earlier in the year.In July 2025 a small number of individuals were sent to South Sudan and Eswatini. These were less than ten in total but it shows the direction of travel Vines told DW. The Uganda deal is a lot more ambitious.The Ugandans themselves have said they would not accept people with criminal records or minors and preferred Africans as the ones they would accept Vines further pointed out raising questions about the purpose of the scheme.Uganda a stretchedout refugee nationJust days prior to the confirmation of the deal Ugandas state minister for foreign affairs Henry Oryem Okello claimed the country did not have the capabilities to take in migrants.But after initially denying the deal with the US government Vincent Bagiire the permanent secretary of Ugandas Foreign Affairs Ministry confirmed the deal while saying it was only a temporary arrangement. Uganda already hosts the largest refugee population in Africa with roughly 1.7 million people housed in various camps across the country according to the United Nations.These are for the most part asylumseekers and recognized refugees who hail from other countries in the region such as the Democratic Republic of Congo South Sudan and Sudan.For the most part these immigrant communities live peacefully alongside the local population  but some think this might changeUganda is a hospitable country hosting many refugees. That is not a big thing to us. But already as a host country we are choking says Dorcus Kimono a local living in the capital Kampala.If these migrants are coming to our country we would not mind sharing the little we have with them. But what is the American government doing for usAlex Wandeba another resident of Kampala shares her views Uganda is already overburdened we have many refugees from the neighboring countries. I feel we have enough on the table.Kimono meanwhile wonders how Ugandans will ultimately benefit from the agreement with the United StatesI would want to hear that if a deal is reached with our government that the US is constructing roads or they are going to help us in the health and education sector. That would be a good deal.Eswatini a kingdom with no rightsThough prior US administrations have also conducted thirdcountry removals the Trumps practice of sending immigrants to countries with considerable political and human rights crises have raised alarm among human rights groups.This was particularly notable last month when the US flew five immigrants from Vietnam Jamaica Laos Yemen and Cuba to Eswatini  the last absolute monarchy in Africa which is known for its troubling rights record.Eswatini has been ruled by Mswati III since 1986. The monarch leads a life of luxury while the population of 12 million of the landlocked nation remains poor.The country has a deteriorating human rights record according to Human Rights Watch and according to reports penned by the US State Department itself as recently as 2023.Political Activist Mphandlana Shongwe says there is widespread public anger in Eswatini about the kings decision to allow those immigrants into the country which appears to fall on deaf ears. We condemn the bringing of hardcore convicts to our country to mix with our young convicts who still have a chance to be rehabilitated Shongwe told DW.Government spokesperson Thabile Mdluli meanwhile assured the public that the five inmates pose no threat to the country or its citizens as they were being kept in isolation at least for now.South Sudan wartorn and unsafeConflicttorn South Sudan meanwhile has also agreed to accept immigrants sent by the Trump administration.Edmund Yakani President of the East African Civil Society Organizations Forum told DW that details of the deal were being kept hidden from the public.Alex Vines meanwhile believes that its all about geopolitics. It is about these countries looking at how to diversify their partnerships and engender improved relationships with the Trump administration that might carry money and other benefits longer term to them he said. South Sudan is very much in the crosshairs of the current US administration visa strategy of restricting access to the US because of a history of overstay of South Sudanese Vines further explained adding that there is also the issue of the US tariffs which may be reduced although that has not impacted these countries particularly.Rwanda acting out of good willRwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makolor confirmed that her country would also take up to 250 deportees from the US under the provision that the government maintains the ability to approve each individual proposed for resettlement under the agreement.Elaborating on why Rwanda accepted the US deal Makolo stated the agreement meant that the African country was doing its part to help with international migration issues because our societal values are founded on reintegration and rehabilitation.Other African nations that are known to have been approached by the US for deporatation deals include Liberia Senegal Gabon Mauretania and GuineaBissau.Nigeria has explicitly rejected any proposal by the US with its Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar saying the country already had enough of its own problems.",

Musk previously labeled Gor a snake and accused him of legal violations related to security clearance paperwork. Trump defended Gor emphasizing his loyalty and importance to USIndia relations amidst ongoing tariff disputes. File photo Elon Musk left and Sergio Gor Picture credit AP X Sergio Gor a close aide to US President Donald Trump has been nominated as the next US Ambassador to India and special envoy for South and Central Asian Affairs.However amid the buzz of his announcement his past clashes with Elon Musk have resurfaced and brought focus on his stormy history with the Tesla founder. Back in June Musk branded Gor a snake after the New York Post revealed he had failed to submit his full security clearance paperwork despite being responsible for vetting thousands of appointees. Musk also accused him of breaking the law by not filing the Standard Form 86 SF86 required for security clearance background checks.According to the Daily Beast Gor allegedly persuaded Trump to withdraw Musks close friend Jared Isaacmans nomination to lead Nasa days before Senate confirmation. Musk said Gor orchestrated Isaacmans downfall to settle scores following a confrontation during his stint on Trumps Department of Government Efficiency DOGE which aimed to slash federal spending. Musk who quit DOGE in May later criticised Gor for delays in staffing and clashed with him during costcutting reviews.According to the Post Gor held a grudge after Musk then serving on Trumps task force publicly criticised him. Sergio was upset about Elon dressing him down at the meeting and said he was going to get him a source told the outlet. The tensions likely added to Musks rupture with Trump in early June when he opposed the presidents sweeping taxcut and spending bill warning it would worsen federal debt. Days later Musk briefly backed impeachment prompting Trump to threaten cancellation of federal contracts with his companies.Announcing the decision on social media Trump described Gor as a great friend who has been at my side for many years and said his appointment to New Delhi was vital at a time when Washington and New Delhi are locked in a bitter tariff dispute.For the most populous region in the world it is important that I have someone I can fully trust to deliver on my agenda and help us make America great again. Sergio will make an incredible Ambassador the president said.He highlighted Gors role in his campaigns book publishing ventures and super PACs calling his service essential to the administration. Vice President JD Vance and US foreign secretary Marco Rubio also welcomed the appointment with Rubio describing USIndia relations as the most important relationship.Gor 38 currently heads the White House Presidential Personnel Office overseeing the recruitment of nearly 4000 federal officials. He will continue in that role until the Senate confirms his appointment. In a post on X Gor said he was beyond grateful to Trump for his trust calling the ambassadorship the honour of my life.Gor will replace Eric Garcetti. His appointment comes as India grapples with 50 per cent US tariffs on its goods including penalties linked to Russian oil purchases.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

        "input": "Donald Trumps claim that fewer than 20 hostages remain alive in Gaza has sparked outrage from families and a swift denial from Israels hostage negotiator. Trump asserted credit for releasing hundreds of hostages a figure disputed by facts. Israeli officials maintain that 50 hostages are still held with 20 believed to be alive while denouncing Hamass extortion tactics. AP file photo  US President Donald Trump said that fewer than 20 hostages held in Gaza remain alive a remark that has drawn anguish from families of the captives and was promptly denied by Israels hostage negotiator. So now they have 20 Trump said while speaking to reporters at the Oval Office on Friday. But the 20 is actually probably not 20 because a couple of them are not around any longer.And you have to understand Im the one who got all of the hostages out Trump said claiming credit for the release of hundreds of captives even though fewer than 150 remained in Gaza when he assumed office on January 20 reported the Times of Israel.Following his remarks the Hostages and Missing Families Forum released a statement that read Mr. President there are 50 hostages. For us each and every one of them is a world in itself.Trump also claimed credit for securing releases during the JanuaryMarch ceasefire denounced Hamass extortion and outlined ongoing efforts to recover the rest of the hostages.The situation has to end its extortion and it has to end Trump said referring to Hamass hostagetaking and negotiations. He added that he believes it would be safer in many ways to free the captives through a military operation rather than a deal with Hamas. Were doing everything we can to get the hostages out its not easy he added.Israels ministry refutes claimsIsraels coordinator for hostage affairs Gal Hirsch said in a statement following Trumps remarks that according to the information we have there is no change in the number of living hostages. Twenty of the hostages are alive two others are in grave danger for their lives 28 are no longer alive and have been declared deceased he wrote to the families.Trump was also questioned about why the United States seems to support Israels move to seize control of Gaza City despite opposition from the families of the hostages who fear the move could endanger their loved ones. Not all of them Trump replied seemingly pointing to a minority of hostage relatives who support Israels expanded operation in Gaza.Israeli officials maintain that 50 hostages are being held in Gaza 49 of the 251 abducted during the Hamasled assault on October 7 2023 along with one captive taken earlier. 28 among them have been confirmed dead by the IDF and authorities believe 20 hostages are still alive. The condition of two others remain in serious doubt. Hamas is also reportedly holding the body of an IDF soldier killed in Gaza in 2014 as per the Times of Israel. Earlier this week Israel advanced further into Gaza pressing ahead with its plan to seize the territory while simultaneously approving thousands of new housing units in the occupied West Bank steps that drew international concern and renewed debate over the prospects of a Palestinian state.Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin the IDFs chief spokesperson announced that Israel has begun the next phase of the war noting that troops had reached the outskirts of Gaza City and were preparing to relocate displaced residents to southern Gaza reported The New York Times.More than 62000 people have been killed in the besieged Gaza Strip since the start of the conflict as per Gazas health ministry.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

San Francisco ICE clashes with protesters charge knifewielding suspect Picture credit DHS Federal authorities on Friday said US Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE officers clashed with protesters in San Francisco this week with one knifewielding suspect now facing charges after allegedly threatening to stab an officer and target his family. The US Department of Homeland Security DHS confirmed the incident happened on Wednesday outside 100 Montgomery Street where ICE agents were carrying out immigration enforcement. Around 1520 demonstrators surrounded four officers spraying pepper spray and physically assaulting them. One officer sustained a jammed finger while others suffered irritation from chemical spray DHS said. Court filings cited by the New York Post identified the suspect as Adrian Guerrero a US citizen. He has been charged with assaulting an officer and destruction of property. Guerrero is accused of slashing the tire of a governmentmarked Chevrolet earlier that morning before confronting ICE agents. While wielding a black knife and wearing a patterned keffiyehstyle scarf with tinted goggles Guerrero allegedly shouted Im going to f you up. Im going to go after your family. Im going to stab you. Photos cited in the complaint show Guerrero confronting agents reported the New York Post. He was arrested still carrying the knife and clothing described. Federal Protective Services and San Francisco police later arrived to help disperse the crowd. According to KQED confrontations with protesters began earlier that morning near the immigration courthouse. An ICE officer peppersprayed both a protester and a reporter who said he was filming the incident when an officer grabbed a bicycle handle and sprayed without provocation. It wasnt provoked  There were no aggressive movements other than me approaching the scene the journalist was quoted as saying by KQED. At least one protester was later detained outside ICEs Sansome Street field office after being tackled ziptied and taken inside.KQED reported that an ICE officer also fired a weapon that released white powder during a scuffle involving a protester and a bike. The confrontation eventually dispersed though many protesters regrouped at the courthouse midmorning. Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem condemned the assault saying ICE officers now face a 1000 increase in assaults while targeting dangerous offenders. These acts of violence are fuelled by sanctuary politicians rhetoric vilifying our law enforcement she said in a DHS statement. We will not and have not let this violence stop us or slow us down she added. The attack follows other violent confrontations with federal agents. In July ten armed men in tactical gear opened fire on an ICE detention centre near Dallas where all suspects were later charged with attempted murder according to the New York Post.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The decision follows a similar rejection for Erik keeping both brothers incarcerated despite their reduced sentences. Lyle Menendez appears before the parole board via teleconference at the Richard J Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego. Picture credit AP Lyle Menendez one of the two brothers convicted of murdering their wealthy parents in Beverly Hills more than three decades ago has been denied parole by a California state panel.The 57yearold who uses his middle name Joseph appeared by video from a San Diego prison on Friday for his first parole hearing since being resentenced earlier this year. After an 11hour closeddoor session commissioners decided he must remain behind bars for at least three more years according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Joseph Lyle Menendez was denied parole for three years at his initial suitability hearing today the department said in a statement as cited by news agency AFP.The ruling follows Thursdays decision in the case of his younger brother Erik 54 whose parole was also rejected. The siblings convicted in 1996 of killing Jose and Kitty Menendez with shotguns in 1989 were originally sentenced to life without parole. A Los Angeles judge reduced those terms in May to 50 years to life making them eligible for release as they were under 26 at the time of the crime as per news agency AP.The Menendez case first shocked America in 1989 when Lyle then 21 and Erik 18 killed their parents inside their Beverly Hills mansion. They initially told investigators it was linked to their fathers business or the Mafia but two months later Erik confessed to a psychologist that he and his brother were responsible. The brothers were arrested in 1990 and later charged with firstdegree murder. Prosecutors said the motive was greed while the defence argued they acted after years of sexual and emotional abuse as per AP.Their first trials in the early 1990s ended with hung juries but in 1995 they were convicted of murder along with lying in wait and special circumstances allegations. They were sentenced the following year to life without parole. For decades appeals were denied by state and federal courts.While in prison the brothers engaged in education led selfhelp classes and even launched a prison beautification project inspired by Norways rehabilitation model according to AP. Their case has also drawn renewed public attention through truecrime shows including Netflixs nineepisode series Monsters The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story.As per The New York Times Fridays hearing was Lyles first chance at release though parole boards rarely grant freedom at an initial review. Both brothers will be eligible for new hearings in three years but could also pursue clemency from California Governor Gavin Newsom or continue legal challenges.According to AP the parole board weighs whether inmates pose an unreasonable risk of danger to society if freed considering their criminal history motivation remorse behaviour in prison and reentry plans. Nearly all of the Menendez family members have backed their release their uncle Milton Andersen one of the few who opposed it died earlier this year.Though formally denied parole for three years the brothers may be reviewed sooner with administrative reconsideration possible within a year and another hearing in as little as 18 months. They also still have a pending habeas corpus petition filed in May 2023 that seeks to reopen their convictions based on new evidence supporting their claims of sexual abuse by their father.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Investigations are ongoing with distraction identified as the likely cause.  A tour bus carrying 54 people from Niagara Falls to New York City overturned on Interstate 90 near Pembroke New York on Friday afternoon killing five passengers and injuring dozens more. Authorities say the driver became distracted and lost control before overcorrecting causing the bus to veer off the road and roll onto its side news agency AP reported.Major Andre Ray of the New York State Police confirmed that the dead were all adults with passengers ranging in age from one to 74. Many victims were thrown from the vehicle and several became trapped beneath the wreckage before being pulled to safety. Rescue operations continued for hours with helicopters and ambulances transporting more than 40 people to nearby hospitals.Became distracted lost controlPolice said mechanical failure and driver impairment have been ruled out making distraction the most likely cause of the crash. The operator became distracted lost control and overcorrected Ray explained as quoted by AP.The bus operated by MY Tour Inc. of Staten Island had no record of previous accidents in the past two years and carried a satisfactory federal safety rating. The driver survived and is cooperating with investigators.The National Transportation Safety Board has dispatched a team to assist in examining the crash which occurred around 1230 p.m. on the busy New York State Thruway. Witnesses reported seeing the bus swerve into the median before crossing to the shoulder and overturning.Many victims from India China and the PhilippinesAuthorities said most of the passengers were of Indian Chinese and Filipino background and translators were brought to the scene to aid emergency services. Lists provided by the company confirmed 54 people were on board including the driver and a tour company employee.At Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo 24 patients were treated for serious trauma including head injuries and broken bones. Its probably the most trauma patients from one incident in my career here in Buffalo said Dr Samuel Cloud the hospitals chief medical officer. Other patients were flown to the University of Rochester Medical Center where two remained in critical condition.Officials believe many passengers were not wearing seat belts at the time. New York law requires seat belt use on charter buses built after November 2016 though the age of the bus has not been confirmed.Shock and mourningGovernor Kathy Hochul described the accident as a tragedy and said her office was working closely with police and local officials.

        "input": "The seatbelt sign pings on trays rattle drinks slosh in their glasses. For many flyers air turbulence can be an unnerving experience  and in a world warming under the effects of climate change it is only set to worsen according to a growing body of scientific evidence.Here are the key things to know during another searing summer in 2025.Why turbulence mattersBeyond making people uneasy turbulence is also the leading cause of inflight weather accidents according to official data.The numbers remain relatively small there were 207 reported injuries on US commercial flights between 2009 and 2024. But highprofile incidents have thrust the issue into the spotlight.These include an Air Europa flight last year in which 40 passengers were hurt and a Singapore Airlines flight where one elderly passenger died and dozens were injured.Typically injuries are to unbelted passengers or cabin crew rather than structural damage John Abraham a mechanical engineering professor at the University of St. Thomas told AFP.Modern aircraft withstand turbulence so the main risk is occupant injury not loss of the plane.Still planes must be inspected after severe encounters with turbulence  about 1.5 times the normal force of Earths gravity  which occur some 5000 times a year over the US said Robert Sharman a senior scientist emeritus at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.Turbulence also increases fuel consumption when pilots must leave optimal altitudes alter routes or change speeds Abraham added.How climate change is making it worseMohamed Foudad an atmospheric scientist at the University of Reading in the UK explained there are three main types of turbulence convective mountain wave and clearair turbulence CAT.Convective turbulence is linked to rising or sinking air currents from clouds or thunderstorms that can be detected visually or by onboard radar while mountain wave turbulence occurs over mountain ranges. CAT by contrast is invisible  and therefore the most dangerous.It generally arises from jet streams fastmoving westerly winds in the upper atmosphere at the same altitude as commercial jets about 1012 kilometers up.With climate change the tropics are warming faster at cruising altitude than higher latitudes. That increases the temperature difference between the higher and lowerlatitudes driving up jet stream velocity and wind shear  volatile shifts in vertical air currents that trigger CAT.Foudad and colleagues published a paper last year in the Journal of Geophysical Research Atmospheres analyzing data from 1980 to 2021.We find a clear positive trend  an increase in turbulence frequency over many regions including the North Atlantic North America East Asia the Middle East and North Africa he told AFP with increases ranging from 60 to 155 percent. Further analysis attributed the rising turbulence in certain regions to increased greenhouse gas emissions.What happens nextA 2023 paper led by Isabel Smith at the University of Reading found that for every degree Celsius of nearsurface warming winters would see an increase of about nine percent in moderate CAT in the North Atlantic and summers a rise of 14 percent.Winter has historically been the roughest season for turbulence but warming is now amplifying CAT in summer and autumn closing the gap.Jet stream disruption is not the only concern climate change is also fueling stronger storms.Climate change may also increase the frequency and severity of thunderstorms under future scenarios and turbulence encounters near thunderstorms are a major component of turbulence accidents Sharman told AFP.In terms of mitigation strategies Foudad is working on two studies optimizing flight routes to avoid turbulence hotspots and improving forecasting accuracy.Some airlines are moving towards strategies involving passengers wearing seatbelts more often such as ending cabin service earlier.Promising technologies are also being tested says Sharman including onboard LIDAR which beams lasers into the atmosphere to detect subtle shifts in air density and wind speed.Ultimately cutting greenhouse gas emissions will be essential Foudad added.Aviation is responsible for about 3.5 percent of humancaused warming. Airlines are exploring cleaner fuels to help reduce the industrys footprint though progress has been disappointingly slow according to the International Air Transport Association.",

This sighting is believed to be the first recorded appearance of this species in the district sparking hope and excitement within the wildlife community.Historically the chital roamed freely across the Aravalis stretching from Gurgaon to the Delhi Ridge. However the rapid urbanisation of the 1980s and 1990s  fuelled by mining real estate expansion and deforestation  fragmented their habitats pushing them into core forest zones like the AsolaBhatti wildlife sanctuary. A 2017 Wildlife Institute of India WII survey of Haryanas Aravalis reported a significant decline in wildlife population including that of the spotted deer due to habitat loss and fragmentation.According to officials this is the first confirmed sighting of a spotted deer in the Aravalis in recent records. Vivek Saxena principal chief conservator of forests wildlife said We do not have data on the last sighting of chital in the Aravalis but this sighting definitely shows that habitat improvements helped wildlife return to the region.You Can Also Check Gurgaon AQI  Weather in Gurgaon  Bank Holidays in Gurgaon  Public Holidays in Gurgaon  Gold Rates Today in Gurgaon  Silver Rates Today in GurgaonThe sighting underscores the significance of green spaces at the urban fringe. Badkhal lake is situated at the edge of the Southern Aravali Ridge which connects to the larger Delhi Ridge ecology and links with areas like the AsolaBhatti sanctuary an essential corridor for wildlife in this region.Wildlife when given undisturbed green spaces sometimes ventures back into areas we might consider too crowded. This visit could indicate that the wildlife corridor is active or that native habitat is gradually reclaiming ground. Either way it serves as a subtle reminder of the broader environmental threads still weaving through our daily lives said wildlife biologist Sumit Dookia.If sightings like this become more frequent experts suggested it could be time to consider restoring or strengthening habitat links including corridors between Asola and Sarika where the spotted deer population is currently active.Seeing a spotted deer in Faridabad is a positive sign. It shows that even small patches of forest and wetlands can support wildlife if they are protected. Whats crucial now is to ensure these green spaces remain connected so animals can move safely across the Aravalis said wildlife expert Sunil Harsana.

They said the changes which are driven by climate change could lead to catastrophic consequences for generations.The research was published in the journal Nature. It sought to describe the interlocking effects of global warming on the Antarctic the frozen continent at the planets South Pole.The overwhelming evidence of a regime shift in sea ice means that on current trends Antarctica could essentially become ice free in summer sooner than the Arctic the study found.This will speed up warming in the region and beyond and could push some marine species toward extinction.Antarctic sea ice may actually be one of those tipping points in the Earths system said the studys lead author Nerilie Abram a former professor at the Australian National University ANU and now chief scientist at the Australian Antarctic Division.The study warns that curbing global carbon dioxide emissions would reduce the risk of major changes in the Antarctic but still may not prevent them.Once we start losing Antarctic sea ice we set in train this selfperpetuating process Abram said. Even if we stabilize the climate we are committed to still losing Antarctic sea ice over many centuries to come.What did the study sayResearchers gathered data from observations ice cores and ship logbooks to chart longterm changes in the area of sea ice.A rapid and substantial slowdown of the currents has already begun.This would lead to widespread climate and ecosystem impacts ranging from an intensification of global warming to a decrease in the oceans capacity to absorb CO2 the study reported.Will it affect wildlifeSome 90 of the heat generated by manmade global warming is soaked up by oceans.Since 2014 sea ice has retreated on average 120 kilometers 75 miles from the continents shoreline.

The incident which occurred late Saturday night in Jodh Ghati village washed away roads damaged homes and forced authorities into urgent rescue and relief operations.Train services along the vital JammuPathankot line have also been suspended as rising water levels crossed danger marks on a key railway bridge. Helicopter evacuations have been launched while multiple agencies including the Army NDRF SDRF and police are on the ground to restore connectivity and assist victims.Here are the top developmentsDeath toll rises to seven in KathuaOfficials confirmed that seven people have died in two separate incidents of cloudburst and landslide in Kathua. Five casualties occurred in Jodh Ghati following flash floods triggered by the overnight downpour while two more died after a landslide in Janglote.Jammu Divisional Commissioner Ramesh Kumar said There was heavy rain in Kathua since last night... Seven people have died due to the landslide. Rescue operations are ongoing... Those who died due to the landslide their bodies have been retrieved. Rescue teams are still combing through debris and floodhit areas amid fears of more missing persons. Helicopters were pressed into service due to washedaway roads and villages cut off from access.Train traffic disrupted on JammuPathankot lineRail connectivity has been badly affected with the suspension of upline train movement between Kathua and Budhi. Senior Divisional Commercial Manager Jammu Railway Division Uchit Singhal said Due to heavy rains water is flowing above the danger level through bridge number 43 between KathuaBudhi. In view of this temporarily till the water level subsides upline movement has been suspended and in the meantime up trains are being moved via a temporary single line through the down line track. Villages cut off after flash floods and landslidesThe cloudburst snapped access to Jodh Ghati village where floodwaters swept through homes and agricultural fields leaving families stranded. Several connecting roads were washed away and a bridge collapsed worsening the situation. Deputy Commissioner Kathua Rajesh Sharma confirmed that rescue operations are underway and that stranded people are being shifted to safer areas. Local police reported that a station building in Kathua had also been damaged. Rescue operations led by Army and NDRFThe Indian Army NDRF SDRF police and BRO have been deployed in full strength across Kathua. Heavy machinery has been brought in to fragment massive boulders that rolled down into residential areas. Inspector General of Police Jammu Zone Bhim Sen Tuti said Boulders had fallen here which needed to be fragmented... Heavy machinery has been called for that. With the help of BRO they are being fragmented here. These boulders are being removed by using explosives wherever needed and bodies have been recovered from beneath them.Helicopter evacuation for injured victimsUnion minister Jitendra Singh confirmed that helicopter services were arranged to shift injured people to nearby hospitals. In his social media post Singh wrote Helicopter services have been arranged for shifting the injured to appropriate hospitals. 6 injured have been airlifted for hospitalisation in Mamoon Pathankot which was found to be relatively nearer destination. DIG Police Shiv Kumar Sharma and his team are camping at the site and coordinating airlifts. Centre closely monitoring situation says Amit ShahUnion home minister Amit Shah assured full support from the Central government. In a post on X Shah wrote Spoke with the Lieutenant Governor and Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir regarding the cloudburst in Kathua. Relief and rescue operations are being carried out by the local administration and NDRF teams have also been rushed to the site. Assured every support from the Modi government. We stand firmly behind our sisters and brothers of JK. LG Manoj Sinha calls tragedy mindnumbingJammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha expressed grief over the loss of lives. In his message on X he wrote Deeply anguished by the loss of lives in the devastating raintriggered landslides in several areas of Kathua. The tragedy is mindnumbing. Briefed Honble Union Home Minister Sh. Amit Shah Ji on rescue and relief operations by the army NDRF SDRF police  administration. CM Omar Abdullah announces exgratia reliefChief minister Omar Abdullah conveyed condolences and directed immediate assistance for affected families. A statement from his office said Rs 2 lakh would be given for each deceased Rs 1 lakh for severely injured and Rs 50000 for those with minor injuries. Compensation has also been announced for damaged homes Rs 1 lakh for fully damaged houses Rs 50000 for severely damaged houses and Rs 25000 for partially damaged houses. The Chief Minister has directed the administration to carry out immediate relief rescue and evacuation measures to ensure the safety and support of affected families the statement said.Repeated cloudburst disasters in JKThe Kathua disaster comes just three days after a cloudburst in Kishtwars Chisoti village killed 60 people and injured over 100. Experts warn that frequent extreme weather in JK is linked to changing rainfall patterns and climate pressures in the Himalayan region. Officials say the backtoback incidents highlight the need for stronger disaster preparedness and better drainage infrastructure. While the state government has sought central assistance locals in Kathua have urged longterm flood protection measures. This includes improved embankments realtime weather alerts and a review of building norms in vulnerable areas.Connectivity and services slowly being restoredAuthorities are now focused on restoring essential services including power water and road links. In Kishtwar where floods occurred earlier officials said blasting of boulders was undertaken to clear blocked roads. Rope bridges are being built to reconnect cutoff villages in Kathua. The power supply and water supply have been restored. A bridge is being built here with the help of the Army... All the passengers stranded in Machail were safely evacuated yesterday said Divisional Commissioner Ramesh Kumar.

A cruel summer as record wildfires scorch Europe Wildfires continue to burn across the south of Europe amid recordbreaking summer heatwaves in many fireprone regions. In some places these fires have been exacerbated by wet spring months which have helped vegetation growth capable of catching alight with ease during a dry summer.Already an area equivalent to 1.5 times the size of Luxembourg  roughly 438568 hectares  has burned across Europe in 2025. That figure is almost three times the size of fire damaged caused up to the same point in 2024.It comes as some parts of southern Europe suffer through multiple 40degree 104 Fahrenheit days and prolonged heatwaves lasting a fortnight.The current summer has been described as the worst for wildfires in two decades.Where are the fires burning What is the situation right nowWere seeing extreme temperatures in large parts of Europe records being broken of 40 degrees in many places said Julie Berckmans a climate scientist at the European Environmental Agency.Southern France Spain Greece Turkey Belgium Netherlands UK are all hitting high temperatures and massive wildfires in Spain Portugal France Greece Turkey Albania.In Spain those fires have burned through an area the size of London already.Portugal is fighting its own fires with around four thousand firefighters currently active across seven active sites. It has also been forced to request help from the European Unions firefighting forces.An even greater number of firefighters has been mobilized in Greece which is battling 20 blazes during this peak fire season.Deaths have occurred in Spain Portugal Montenegro and Italy from fires and heatrelated events this summer.It has been a severe fire seasonEurope uses data from its Copernicus satellite fleet to monitor fire activity and collates the data via the European Forest Fires Information System EFFIS.A substantial amount of fire damage in 2025 has already occured.More than 250000 hectares more of land has burnt than the same time in 2024.There have more than 1600 fires across Europe compared to just under 1100 last year.And new regions are also experiencing greater than usual fire activity.Spain for instance has seen twice as much of its territory burnedthrough compared to the 20062024 average. Romania has lost four times as much land to fires this year.Cyprus has been badly impacted. It could usually expect to see around 0.32 of its landmass burned each year. Already in 2025 its 2.5  nearly eight times more.But its also the number of fires that is concerning. France has had nearly three times as many fires as average amid what has been the worst wildfire season for its southern regions in decades.More to come...The fallout of severe wildfires goes beyond land loss or human fatalities. Damage to ecosystems through vegetation loss health impacts through smoke inhalation and economic decline are all consequences of widespread fire events.Its about 2.5 billion 2.9 billion of damage lost every year in the EU Berckmans told DW. 45000 people on average were displaced due to wildfires from 2008 to 2023.The European Environment Agencys first climate risk assessment published in 2024 found that urgent action is required to address the critical risk wildfires will pose to populations and infastructure and biodiversity in southern Europe.Wildfires are an urgent risk to address said Berckmans. Its also a major risk that needs more action now in the rest of Europe.As European fall approaches the number of fires and the damage they cause should slow. However forecasting the length of fire danger season and the behavior of fires themselves is becoming more difficult.Climate change will not only generate warmer and drier conditions across southern Europe it will also begin to change other dynamic factors.Faster and more volatile wind systems for instance will increase the challenge for fire management personnel to predict how blazes will behave. That puts the lives of emergency workers and civilians at greater risk.Picture a fire so fierce so fast and so unpredictable it seems alive capable of reshaping the weather around it and leaping across kilometers in a heartbeat said Antonio Lopez an expert in wildfires at the University of Seville Spain.",
        "output": "The European Union (EU) is leading the way with a climate-smart fire strategy. It calls for countries to adopt flexible fire policies that adapt to changing climate conditions. It also promotes the use of smart technologies like drones to monitor and report on fires. It is the first time a national fire strategy has been developed for Europe."

        "input": "Marking Independence Day celebrations the Prime Minister announced and hailed the achievement as a pivotal step towards an Atmanirbhar Bharat in the energy sector underscoring the countrys transformation from a fossilfueldependent importer to a global clean energy leader.When the world today expresses concern over global warming I wish to tell the world that Bharat has resolved to achieve 50 per cent clean energy by 2030. That was our target for 2030. Look at the capability of my countrymen look at their determination to fulfil the resolve of making Bharat developedwe achieved the 50 per cent clean energy target in 2025 itself five years ahead of schedule. This is because we are as sensitive towards the world as we are responsible towards nature PM Modi said on the occasion of 79th Independence.At COP26 held in 2021 India committed to an ambitious fivepart Panchamrit pledge.This included reaching 500 GW of nonfossil electricity capacity generating half of all energy requirements from renewables and reducing emissions by 1 billion tonnes by 2030. India also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent and achieve netzero emissions by 2070.According to the latest government data India added a record 29.52 gigawatts GW of renewable capacity in 202425 taking total installed renewable energy RE capacity to 234.24 GW excluding nuclear up from 198.75 GW last year.Solar energy leads the charge with installed capacity skyrocketing from just 2.82 GW in 2014 to 116.24 GW today now accounting for nearly half of Indias total RE capacity.Wind power follows at 51.67 GW while large and small hydro contribute 54.72 GW combined. Biopower has also grown to 11.59 GW over the past decade.India now ranks 4th globally in total RE capacity 3rd in solar power and 4th in wind energy boasting the worlds fastestgrowing renewable program.The clean energy surge has been powered by a suite of ambitious government reforms and programs.The PMSurya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana with a Rs 75021 crore outlay aims to provide free solar electricity to one crore households.As of August 14 2025 over 17.24 lakh households have benefitted with subsidies worth Rs 9841.77 crore released. The scheme also introduced Model Solar Villages to promote decentralised clean power at the grassroots level.In agriculture the PMKUSUM scheme has installed over 8.53 lakh solar pumps replacing dieselpowered systems and cutting an estimated 6.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.Beyond solar India is expanding in wind hydro bioenergy green hydrogen and nuclear power. Offshore wind projects backed by a Rs 7453 crore viability gap funding scheme are set to add 1 GW capacity off Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.The National Green Hydrogen Mission with a Rs 19744 crore budget targets 5 million metric tonnes MMT annual production by 2030 along with 125 GW of new RE Rs 8 lakh crore in investments and 6 lakh jobs. Hydrogen hubs have been identified in Kandla Paradip and Tuticorin.In the nuclear sector operational capacity has grown from 4780 MW in 2014 to 8780 MW across 25 reactors with a remarkable 87 per cent plant load factor in 202425. Ten new reactors are already functional and capacity is set to increase tenfold by 2047.The result is a virtuous cycle local manufacturing creates jobs and resilience competitive tariffs make clean energy affordable and inclusive programs bring every citizen into the transition. As we look ahead to 2030 and beyond India is not just meeting global commitments  it is setting a new template for how a nation can grow decarbonise and remain selfreliant. In the journey from energy dependence to energy leadership the momentum is unmistakable and the destination is clear an Atmanirbhar Bharat powered by its own clean green energy the government said today in a factsheet.With five years gained on its clean energy target India is now firmly on track to meet and potentially exceed its 500 GW nonfossil capacity goal by 2030 positioning itself as a decisive force in the global fight against climate change.

Consensus must be the basis of all our decisions Kuwait insisted.Nudging in the same direction Saudi Arabia speaking for the Arab Group said the responsible way ahead was to start considering what bits of the text may not make it to the final outcome due to irreconcilable divergence.But given how little is truly agreed on Uruguay warned that consensus cannot be used as a justification to not achieve our objectives.Eirik Lindebjerg global plastics adviser for the World Wide Fund for Nature told AFP that the LikeMinded Groups proposal was another attempt to make it a waste management agreement and to stifle talks on reducing the amount of plastic in circulation.Path through the fogThe UN Environment Programme is hosting the talks and swiftly called a press conference after the stocktake session.UNEP executive director Inger Andersen said a deal was really within our grasp even though today it might not look so.Despite the fog of negotiations Im really encouraged she told reporters insisting There is a pathway to success.Vayas added We need to accelerate. We need a better rhythm in this and we need to also work in such a way that it will be clear that we will deliver by the end.Afterwards Bjorn Beeler executive director at IPEN a global network aimed at limiting toxic chemicals told AFP This whole process has not been able to take decisions and is still collecting ideas. Were sleepwalking towards a cliff and if we dont wake up were falling off.Profits from poisoningPlastic pollution is so ubiquitous that microplastics have been found on the highest mountain peaks in the deepest ocean trench and scattered throughout almost every part of the human body.More than 400 million tonnes of plastic are produced globally each year half of which is for singleuse items.Plastic production is set to triple by 2060.Panamas negotiator Juan Monterrey Gomez took the floor to slam those countries wanting to stop the treaty from encompassing the entire life cycle of plastic.He said microplastics are in our blood in our lungs and in the first cry of a newborn child. Our bodies are living proof of a system that profits from poisoning us. We cannot recycle our way out of this crisis.",

        "input": "Tropical bird populations have plummeted not only due to deforestation but also extreme heat attributable to climate change according to a study published on Monday in the journal Nature Ecology  Evolution. Intensifying temepratures caused a 2538 percent reduction in tropical bird populations between 1950 and 2020 compared to a scenario without manmade global warming scientists based in Europe and Australia reported. The findings are pretty stark lead author Maximilian Kotz a researcher at the National Supercomputing Centre in Barcelona and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research PIK told AFP.Bird populations in the tropics now face 30 days of heat extremes per year compared to three per year in the mid20th century he noted. This has major consequences for how we think about biodiversity conservation Kotz said by email. Protecting pristine habitats is crucial but without dealing with climate change it wont be enough for birds.Nearly half of all bird species are found in biodiversityrich tropical regions. These often colourful animals perform essential services for ecosystems such as dispersing plant seeds. Invasive species another threatBut birds living in these regions may already be close to the limits of their tolerance to high temperatures which can cause heatstroke hyperthermia or dehydration. The overview study does not provide figures for individual species but earlier literature is rich with examples of the devastating impact of rising temperatures.One documented the heatrelated decline of birds in Panama including the king quetzal the redcrested quetzal the twocoloured kingfisher and the aurora trogon. Another study published in 2017 showed how some tropical hummingbirds are now forced to seek shade to regulate their temperature in extreme heat cutting into the amount of time they can spend searching for lifesustaining nectar. Extreme heat waves which are becoming more frequent represent a far greater threat than increases in average temperatures or rainfall another result of humaninduced climate change. Up to now it has been assumed that the decline in bird populations worldwide was due mainly to other wellidentified factors especially habitat loss pesticide use hunting and invasive species especially snakes that snack on bird eggs and mosquitos carrying avian malaria. But the new findings challenge the view that direct human pressures have so far been the dominant driver of impacts on bird populations compared to climate change in tropical regions according to the authors. To reach this conclusion they analysed observational data from more than 3000 bird populations around the world and used statistical modelling to isolate the effects of extreme weather from other factors.The findings help complete the picture of tropical bird decline noted Aimee Van Tatenhove a postdoctoral fellow at Cornell Universitys Center for Avian Population Studies who was not involved in the study.Deforestation has an obvious impact  trees are cut and habitat is destroyed she told AFP. We need longterm datasets like the authors used to understand how extreme temperatures impact avian populations.This study is an important reminder that we need to continue examining different causes of population declines and apply those findings to conservation initiatives she continued.",

Irelands wind energy sector has long been touted as full of potential. AI image BANGOR On Irelands blustery western seaboard researchers are gleefully flying giant kites not for fun but in the hope of generating renewable electricity and sparking a revolution in wind energy.We use a kite to capture the wind and a generator at the bottom of it that captures the power Padraic Doherty of Kitepower the Dutch firm behind the venture told AFP. At its test site in operation since September 2023 near the small town of Bangor Erris the team transports the vast 60squaremetre 645000squarefeet kite from a hangar across the lunarlike bogland to a generator. The kite is then attached by a cable tether to the machine and acts like a yoyo or fishing reel Doherty said.It gets cast out and flies up the tether pulls it back in over and over again creating energy he said testing the kites ropes and pulleys before a flight.The sparsely populated spot near the stormy Atlantic coast is the worlds first designated airborne renewable energy test site. And although the idea is still small in scale it could yet prove to be a mighty plan as Ireland seeks to cut its reliance on fossil fuels such as oil and gas.We are witnessing a revolution in wind energy said Andrei Luca operations head at Kitepower a zeroemissions energy solutions spinoff from the Delft University of Technology.It took nearly 25 years for wind turbines to evolve from 30kilowatt prototypes to megawatt scale and decades to offshore wind farms we see today he added.The system flies autonomously driven by software developed at the university in the Netherlands but Doherty acts as the kites pilot on the ground monitoring its flight path for efficiency. The kite flies up around 400 metres 1300 feet and reels in to about 190 metres generating around 30 kilowatts for storage.The force spins like a dynamo on a bike Doherty said adding that it generates up to two and a half tonnes of force through each turn.The electricity is stored in batteries similar to solar photovoltaic systems with the kite currently able to fully charge a 336kilowatthour kWh battery.Thats a meaningful amount of energy sufficient for powering a remote outpost a small island polar station or even a construction site Luca said.Add additional kites and we can power a bigger island.Mobile flexibleAccording to Doherty a chief advantage of the kite system is its flexibility and swift startup capability.We can set up in 24 hours and can bring it anywhere its super mobile and doesnt need expensive time and energyconsuming turbine foundations to be built he said. A kite system is way less invasive on the landscape than wind turbines produces clean energy and doesnt need a supply chain of fuel to keep running Luca added.During Januarys Storm Eowyn which caused widespread and longlasting power outages in Ireland the system showed its value in Bangor Erris according to Luca. Paired with a battery it provided uninterrupted electricity before during and after the storm he said. Irelands wind energy sector has long been touted as full of potential.But progress on largescale delivery of onshore and offshore turbines has been held up by planning delays and electricity grid capacity constraints.The Irish government has set ambitious targets for offshore wind energy to deliver 20 gigawatts of energy by 2040 and at least 37 gigawatts by 2050.In 2024 Irish wind farms provided around a third of the countrys electricity according to Wind Energy Ireland WEI a lobby group for the sector. This compares to the UK where according to trade association RenewableUK wind energy from the countrys combined wind farms first reached 20 gigawatts in November 2022.The ability of airborne wind energy AWE systems to harness highaltitude winds with relatively low infrastructure requirements makes them particularly suitable for remote offshore or mobile applications Mahdi Salari an AWE researcher at University College Cork told AFP.But he said Kitepower would face challenges on regulation safety and system reliability. Such technology however could plug gaps in places where land availability costs or logistical constraints hinder the deployment of traditional wind turbines Salari said.By the 2030s he said I expect AWE to contribute meaningfully to diversified flexible and distributed renewable energy networks.Discover stories of Indias leading ecoinnovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025",

Mehars customengineered drone reached this remarkable milestone in an astonishing 0.91 seconds a feat that not only demonstrates his technical prowess but also sets a new benchmark in the rapidly evolving world of drone technology.Mehars journey to this achievement has been anything but straightforward. His fascination with drones began in 8th grade and this passion has only deepened over the years. With a keen interest in pushing technological boundaries Mehar embarked on a monthslong project to build a drone capable of unparalleled vertical acceleration.Ive always been fascinated by the idea of pushing the limits of what drones can do Mehar explained. But breaking a world record wasnt just about the end result it was about the process. I wanted to prove that current technology could achieve something extraordinary but the path to get there was filled with challenges.The project required Mehar to design test and refine multiple drone prototypes. There were moments when I felt like I was chasing an impossible dream Mehar recalled. I went through countless designs and many of them failed during testing. Some drones crashed so badly that I had no choice but to go back to the drawing board and start from scratch. Each crash was a setback but it also sparked new ideas and innovations.Undeterred by the setbacks Mehar poured his energy into creating a drone that was not only fast but also aerodynamically optimized. I spent countless hours on CAD software meticulously designing and tweaking each component. The goal was to make the drone as streamlined as possible which led me to shape it like a rocket. This design wasnt just about aesthetics it was about reducing drag and maximizing speed.Mehars dedication to his craft paid off in spectacular fashion. Every failure taught me something valuable he said. It forced me to think creatively and to consider every detail from the materials used to the weight distribution of the drone. The process was grueling but it was also incredibly rewarding to see my ideas take flightliterally.This recordbreaking achievement is more than just a personal triumph for Mehar it has significant implications for the future of drone technology. The possibilities are endless Mehar mused. Highspeed vertical acceleration could revolutionize everything from emergency response to space exploration. This isnt just about setting a record its about opening doors to new innovations and applications.Mehars groundbreaking work has already begun to inspire others in the drone community and beyond. I hope this accomplishment encourages other young innovators to push their own boundaries he said. Technology is advancing rapidly and theres so much potential waiting to be unlocked. Im excited to see where we can go from here.As Mehar looks ahead the sky is truly the limit. With his recordbreaking drone he has not only made history but also set the stage for future breakthroughs in drone technology. And for this young innovator this is just the beginning of an exciting journey into the future of flight.Disclaimer Content produced by Mediawire on Behalf of Shweta Singh",

        "input": "Microsoft discontinues Surface Duo smartphones but files a patent for a new foldable device with a single hinge system called spine cover plate. The design aims to eliminate the hinge crease and reduce the devices thickness while offering added benefits and durability. However its practicality remains uncertain. Microsoft did not get the success it was anticipating with its Androidpowered Surface Duoseries smartphones. The company has discontinued the lineup after the Duo 2. But this does not mean the company has stopped trying. A new patent application filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29 reveals that the company is working on another foldable or dualdisplay mobile device.The patent application describes the companys take on the foldable smartphone concept with single hinge technology called spine cover plate.Next Microsoft smartphones could feature a Galaxy Z Foldlike designAccording to the patent application the phone could feature a flexible display in a bookstyle design similar to Galaxy Z Fold decies. However the entire focus is on the spine cover plate mechanism which is aimed at protecting the singlehinge system of the device by covering the structural element. The differentiating factor between the regular hinge and Microsofts design is that the spine cover adjusts automatically during the opening and closing of the phone to prevent any unnecessary gaps around the hinge to protect it from dust as well as water. Currently Samsungs design offers an IPX8 rating which makes their foldables waterresistant only.The patent further mentions that the new hinge mechanism could allow Microsoft to eliminate the hinge crease less visible than the current options available in the market. Moreover Microsoft has also mentioned techniques that could allow them to reduce the overall thickness of the foldable smartphone by allowing the spine cover plate to move closer to the devices hinge when folded. By retracting the spine cover plate toward the central spine as the first displaysupporting frame and the second displaysupporting frame are rotated into a facetoface orientation the width of the folded computing device is reduced thereby enabling easier and more comfortable handling of the device such as with one hand Microsoft noted in the patent.Interesting idea but practicality is a question markThe entire smartphone market is searching for a way to eliminate the foldable crease from their smartphones. Some brands have already implemented the waterdrop folding mechanism to reduce it but theres nothing like a creasefree foldable out there. Apart from that the durability quotient of foldable is also important considering all the movable parts these phones have. That said adding another layer or a movable part on top of the entire foldable mechanism does not appear like a wise move despite the added benefits and durability Microsoft has explained in the patent application.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Reason is said to be delay in the delivery of two supercomputers by the French company to Indian weather forecasting institutes. According to a report in news agency PTI the Earth Sciences Ministry had ordered two supercomputers worth 100 million from French firm Eviden of the Atos Group last year to enhance the computing capabilities of its institutions  the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting NCMRWF and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology IITM.I am more upset because the target we set was December. The Union Cabinet had already approved purchasing the supercomputer. We have only four petaflop capacity. We want to install up to 18 petaflop capacity Rijiju told PTI in a video interview.He said that the French company ran into some financial trouble and wanted the government to make payment to its subsidiary.Minister says that the delay is causing him worryRijiju said that the delay has caused him lots of worry as the company has overshot the timeline. But I think we will sort it out soon he said adding that the government wanted to be very correct in our position legally.We are ready to release the money because we want the machine immediately. The only problem is the amount is not small. So if we pay now if the company is bankrupt or something happens who will bail out the minister said.Rijiju further added that the government was taking some steps to speed up the delivery of the supercomputer but did not elaborate. But I hope the French government will also intervene because we have a good understanding and a very good relationship with the French government.Since it is a highcost equipment we want to ensure that the transaction happens duly and properly he said.From outside everythings ready. It is only the problem with the main company. They want us to pay their subsidiary. We will pay only to a company whom we have entered an MoU with Rijiju said.The supercomputing system based on Evidens BullSequana XH2000 is said to have a combined power capacity of up to 21.3 petaflops.Supercomputer at IITMThe supercomputer at the Punebased IITM will provide 13 petaflops of computing power for atmosphere and climate research.

        "input": "The Bar Council of India has imposed a threeyear moratorium on new law colleges due to concerns about declining educational standards and an oversupply of graduates. This pause aims to allow for audits stricter regulations and curriculum reforms to improve the quality of legal education. Exceptions may be considered for underserved regions signalling a calibrated approach to address systemic issues. Law College Dreams A Bright Future The Bar Council of India BCI the statutory body that regulates legal education and practice has recently imposed a threeyear moratorium on the establishment of new law colleges and centres of legal education CLEs. Indias legal education has long resembled an overcrowded courtroom Too many petitioners too few advocates of substance and an avalanche of paper that often hides the paucity of substance. At first glance the decision may appear draconian in a country with soaring demand for legal education. But scratch beneath the surface and the move reflects a deeper crisis in Indias legal training ecosystemone that regulators are keen to fix before allowing further expansion.The problem of quantity over qualityEstimates suggest that India today has over 1700 law colleges producing approximately 8000090000 graduates each year. In theory this should be a celebration of democracy of access of justice made tangible through a wider pool of practitioners. In practice the majority of these institutions are barely more than signboards with classrooms. They offer skeletal libraries nonexistent moot courts and faculty that too often treat teaching as a reluctant parttime job.Multiple surveys by the BCI and independent commissions have revealed that a large share of law colleges operate more as degree shops than serious centres of learning. They lack fulltime qualified faculty libraries are skeletal and clinical legal training is almost absent. The result Graduates who hold a degree but are often illprepared for practice in courts corporate firms or public service.Employment mismatch The graduate glutThe crisis is not just academic but also economic. For every clutch of graduates from National Law Universities who step into gleaming corporate boardrooms there are thousands more who wander from chambers to district courts struggling to find cases or worse jobs that match neither their degree nor their debt. The glut of unemployable law graduates has become the professions open secret.The BCI has been repeatedly criticised for allowing proliferation of substandard colleges leading to an oversupply of graduates with limited practical skills. By announcing a freeze the regulator is signalling that it wants to correct the imbalance between supply and demand.Using the pause to raise standardsThe moratorium is also about buying time to implement reforms. During this threeyear window the BCI aims toAudit existing colleges to ensure compliance with infrastructure faculty and curriculum standards.Tighten recognition norms making it harder for institutions to survive without meeting minimum requirements.Push for practical training including moot courts internships and clinical legal education.Align curricula with contemporary needscyber law arbitration AI and lawso that graduates are better prepared for modern practice.In short the BCI wants to ensure that the next expansion of law colleges is accompanied by higher academic rigour and professional credibility rather than unchecked growth.A history of oversight failuresThis is not the first time the legal education sector has been under the scanner. Back in the 1990s the Yash Pal Committee and the National Knowledge Commission flagged concerns about the proliferation of substandard professional collegesin law engineering and management alike. Despite multiple warnings regulatory loopholes allowed a surge of law colleges in semiurban and rural areas many without the means to deliver quality education.The current moratorium is therefore an acknowledgement of past regulatory failures. It reflects the BCIs recognition that before more licences are granted existing institutions must be cleaned up and strengthened.The broader context Lack of trust in the legal systemIndias judiciary is already battling a credibility crisis with innumerable pending cases long delays and concerns about access to justice. In this context poorly trained lawyers only worsen the problem. The moratorium thus serves a symbolic as well as practical purpose Sending a message that legal education cannot be diluted without damaging the very justice system it feeds into.Interestingly the BCI has kept the door slightly ajar. The Council has said that in backward or underserved regions exceptions may be considered if there is a strong case for opening a new institution. This indicates that the moratorium is not an absolute freeze but a carefully calibrated pause.Recent developmentsWhile new colleges are blocked existing institutions are seeing active regulatory engagementCNLUs 3Year LLB Course Chanakya National Law University Patna has been permitted to start a threeyear LLB programme from 202526 making it the fourth NLU to do so. This suggests that the BCI is still encouraging programme diversification within reputed universities.Gujarat Colleges Back in Admissions Fourteen grantinaid law colleges in Gujarat previously excluded for noncompliance have been reinstated into the admission process after the state government cleared dues and promised reforms. They must now strictly follow faculty and infrastructure norms.The road aheadThe moratorium is not merely about stopping new colleges it is about resetting the standards of legal education in India. If the BCI uses these three years to enforce accountability upgrade curricula and weed out nonperforming institutions the longterm benefits could be significant.However if this pause ends without meaningful reform it risks being yet another cosmetic measureleaving students to bear the brunt of a system that churns out degrees without delivering real opportunity.Ready to navigate global policies Secure your overseas future.

Experts recommend revisiting notes within 24 hours to reinforce memory and transforming notes into personal dialogues with questions and insights. Ultimately good notes spark curiosity and deepen understanding making knowledge truly ones own. 7 effective notetaking techniques that genuinely improve comprehension retention and academic performance Image Pexels If there is one essential skill that students should master in schools and universities it is the art of taking good notes. Notes that are not copied and pasted from professors slides not even the ones that we scribble on a notebook and later become difficult to comprehend. The Art of Taking Notes that could not only be understood but also remembered and used later for learning purposes. Effective notetaking is not just recording facts or copying from textbook to note format. Most notebooks are summaries of textbooks that are never looked at or hardly ever. The whole purpose of note taking is that it is something you will revisit and want to revisit it. So many notes are taken but never made use of.A recent 2025 Cornell University study made a comparison of physics courses where students who were trained in notetaking and motivated to use their selfprepared notes performed better in exams than those with no structured notetaking approach. The study highlighted how strategic notetaking boosts engagement and learning outcomes.As Gen Z is a digital generation they are more comfortable using their screens than paper. Those old spiral notebooks and registers have been replaced by laptops iPads and phones. Technology is good and has made life easier but the issue is that taking notes can become a mindless typing process and the notes are often not even revisited. The long audio recordings contain huge amounts of information but the question is are students processing itWriting notes by hand boosts retention and keeps you more engaged than typing. According to a 2020 study Using voice notetaking to promote learners conceptual understanding taking notes via voice input leads to a higher conceptual understanding of the text and encourages more elaborate and comprehensive notes. The researchers found that instead of typing it was voicebased notetaking that prompted deeper processing and richer more comprehensive note generation. This suggests that leveraging speech input can boost conceptual learning in digital environments.The reality is it doesnt matter what medium students are using for taking notes. Effective notetaking is all about what and how one thinks while writing. Great notes do more than capture information they spark thinking. They spark reflection and connection. They help you understand better not just remember facts which you may as well underline in the original text and you will likely recall better as you look at your textbook more often than a note book.Typing may make us less able to recall the very information we were just working with later according to a study published in Psychological Science. Students at Princeton University took notes on a TED Talk where half used laptops and the other half used a pen and paper. The laptopusing group seemed to transcribe the talk instead of ingesting it this was found via testing of both groups later. Each group was tested on what they had learned a week later and the findings revealed that those who wrote in longhand had better memory recall. Here are some effective notetaking techniques by experts. Listen first write laterDont be in a hurry to jot down whatever you are listening to. Dont be that kid who rushes to write everything. In an interview with TOI Dr CP Rashmi Associate Professor Head of the Institute Amity School of Communication at Amity University in Bangalore advised Pause first and concentrate on listening. Listen understand and then write down notes in your own words. Humans remember processed information better than copied information.Use the Cornell methodSplit the page paper or digital screen into three sections. Dr Rashmi suggested Make a narrow column on the lefthand side where you can jot down questions prompts and keywords that will help you summarise your thoughts. The right section will be used for writing notes and the bottom section is where one will write a summary of the notes that would come in handy before exams. This structure of writing notes not only helps one review the notes but also condenses the information. This system enables the 5 Rs of notetaking record reduce recite reflect and review while the process helps transform raw lecture content into clear retained knowledge.Visualise your learningVisual thinking helps in memorising content better. Dr Rashmi opined One can start with the main topic in the centre of the page and then branch out into subtopics and ideas connecting them like flow charts or graphs. The digital generation can also use many freely available apps for the same purpose. These roughly made sketches help you understand learn and see the bigger picture.Pen and paper Your brains best friendTheres something quietly powerful about the oldschool pen and notebook. Dr Rashmi pointed out Writing on paper with a pen slows you down just enough to think about each word giving your brain time to absorb ideas instead of letting them slide past.Sketchnoting boosts focus and visual memory retention Image PexelsPsychologists have found that writing by hand activates areas of the brain linked to memory focus and even creativity. It is meditation for the brain as it calms the mind. While research shows the anxiety that digital media can cause after hours of scrolling writing is almost meditative your mind feels calmer. Dr Rashmi said The act of holding a pen and writing each letter can feel grounding almost like telling your brain This matters. Pay attention and that mental pause is often what turns information into lasting understanding.Use mind mapsAids like mind maps can turn scattered ideas into clear visual networks. They give away links and patterns that straight lists often hide. Dr. Sunita Gandhi Educator Researcher Innovator Author and Founder of Global Education and Training Institute GETI and Dignity Education Vision International DEVI Sansthan explained Restating and better still making a diagram or a mind map or a flow chart or a graphic organiser especially what you have learned in your own words after a lesson makes you actively process the content which helps it stay in your memory and you may end up using it for revision.Make task cardsThe one type of notetaking that is especially useful is a task card. One side is a question or a topic on the other are bullet points formulae or a graphic summarising the answers or the topic. Dr. Gandhi asserted It is better still that they are on the front and back side of a notebook or even on cards an A4 sheet in half or quarters. You can pick it up every evening for 10 minutes read the question or be reminded of a topic you try to recall what might be on the back side then turn over to see if you got it right. You may even attempt a full question in your rough notebook then review if you get it right. Once you know you have mastered a few cards put them in a new pouch like a ziplock bag and revisit them less often say once a month or near an exam.Have conversations with to yourselfAccording to Dr. Gandhi the best notes are the dialogues with yourself. They capture your questions insights and even moments of doubt. This gives them life and personality rather than leaving them as dry passive records.Though there are many more techniques the golden rule that one should always follow is to review the notes within 24 hours. By revisiting the notes on the same day or the next day you reinforce the memory while the information in your brain is still fresh. This process helps in retaining the information for a longer period.Dr Rashmi shared In my 20 years of teaching Ive seen students with average abilities outshine toppers simply because they knew how to take and use their notes well. Good notes arent just an academic tool theyre your personal library of understanding. Whether youre tapping on a tablet or scribbling in a diary remember notetaking isnt about storing words. Its about making the knowledge truly yours.Good notes spark curiosity. They invite you to return review and build on them. A note that is never revisited is a missed opportunity and worse as it is loads of wasted time in making those notes in the first place. The simple act of writing does not take it to long term memory. Rereading at intervals the same day a week later before a test strengthens memory and understanding. What matters is that your notes serve you. They help you connect ideas and deepen understanding and those you keep revisiting and keep learning alive.Ready to navigate global policies Secure your overseas future. Get expert guidance now",
