Russia-Ukraine conflict: Moscow captures 2 villages in Donetsk region; advances towards Ukrainian logistics base

Russian forces have intensified their military campaign in Ukraine's Donetsk region, claiming the capture of Sredneye and Kleban-Byk. This advance brings Russian troops closer to Kostyantynivka, a strategically important town on the route to Kramatorsk. Kramatorsk serves as a vital logistics hub for Ukrainian forces, potentially disrupting supply lines if the advance continues.

Representative Image (AI-generated)  Russia on Saturday announced that its forces had captured two villages in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, increasing military pressure as international efforts to end the conflict continue.Moscow's defence ministry said on Telegram that its troops had taken control of Sredneye and Kleban-Byk. The capture of Kleban-Byk advances Russian forces closer to the town of Kostyantynivka — a key point on the route to Kramatorsk, which serves as a major Ukrainian logistics hub.Russian forces are advancing slowly in the embattled eastern region, grinding closer to Kyiv’s defensive line in costly metre-for-metre battles.On Friday, Russia reported that its troops had captured three additional villages in the Donetsk region, which it claims to have annexed in September 2022.The latest Russian advances come as hopes dim for a summit between Russian and Ukrainian presidents — a solution pushed by US President Donald Trump as part of his efforts to end the conflict.Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday said that "no meeting" is planned, signaling a stall in Trump’s mediation efforts. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has also accused Russia of attempting to prolong the offensive.Trump had also told reporters on Friday that he would make an "important" decision in two weeks regarding Ukraine peace efforts, suggesting that Moscow could face massive sanctions — or he might "do nothing."About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Racist Berlin street name to change after legal battle

Berlin's Mohrenstrasse, a street with a racist name rooted in Germany's colonial past, was slated to be renamed after Anton Wilhelm Amo, the first African-born scholar to earn a European doctorate. Despite years of lobbying and legal battles, residents initially blocked the change, but the courts ultimately upheld the renaming.

Berlin's Mohrenstrasse, a street with a racist name rooted in Germany's colonial past, was slated to be renamed after Anton Wilhelm Amo, the first African-born scholar to earn a European doctorate. Despite years of lobbying and legal battles, residents initially blocked the change, but the courts ultimately upheld the renaming. AP file photo  "Decolonization does not happen by changing a few street names," political scientist and human rights activist Joshua Kwesi Aikins told DW after it was announced on Friday that a central Berlin street will not have its racist name changed after all. The road had been slated to be renamed in honor of Anton Wilhelm Amo, a Black German Enlightenment philosopher, who in 1734 became the first Africa-born scholar to receive a European doctorate.That was in 2020. At the time, the district council of Berlin-Mitte had approved the renaming, but before it was implemented, residents filed a lawsuit against it.But five years later, in July this year, the Higher Administrative Court of Berlin-Brandenburg upheld a decision by the Berlin Administrative Court stating that residents have no basis to take legal action against the name change.Signs had already been installed, and the change was to be officialized through a symbolic unveiling on Saturday, August 23, which also marks International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition. Though the group "Pro Mohrenstraße" made a last-ditch legal attempt to block the name change, the Berlin-Brandenburg court again upheld its ruling to allow for the name change.Dividing up Africa from BerlinSeveral civil society groups have lobbied for decades to change the name of Mohren or "Moor" Street (respectfully referred to as M-Strasse), and the U-Bahn station of the same name.Moor, in its Greek roots, means dark or black, but also "stupid or primitive," Aikins said.M-Strasse runs through the old quarter of the former Prussian city, steps away from the rebuilt Berlin Palace, which oversaw colonial forays into Africa, and near the former chancellor's residence and venue for the 1884-1885 Berlin Conference.In the words of Berlin-based British-Ugandan writer Musa Okwonga, the major European colonial powers that gathered for the conference "discussed how they might divide up Africa." The conference kickstarted Germany's genocidal colonial rule in Namibia. The M-word's overt racist connotations further derive from the 18th-century practice of bringing enslaved Africans to Germany as "court moors" to work as servants or entertain the Brandenburg electors and Prussian kings as musicians. "The street name given at the beginning of the 18th century transports this racist experience of violence against Black people in Berlin to the present day," wrote historian Christian Kopp of Decolonize Berlin-Mitte.These slaves were mostly brought from the Brandenburg-Prussian colony in current-day Ghana (then known as the Brandenburger Gold Coast), which existed from 1682 to 1721.Who was Anton Wilhelm Amo?Anton Wilhelm Amo himself was enslaved as a boy in Ghana and taken to Amsterdam around 1703. He was then gifted to the German Duke of Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel in 1707, the year M-Strasse was named.Encouraged to study by the Duke, who paid for his education, Amo went on to become the first African-born scholar in Europe to complete a PhD in 1734.Despite Amo's displacement, he embraced his German identity while never forgetting his African heritage. Amo's thesis in law at the University of Halle is lost but was titled "The Rights of Blacks in Europe," which looked at the legal rights of People of Color in the continent.It is said that Amo learned six languages. He later wrote a second doctoral thesis in philosophy that weighed in on philosopher Rene Descartes and his ideas about the duality between mind and body. He also taught classes at the universities in Halle and nearby Jena, but made a meager living before returning to Ghana in 1747. The date of his death is unknown.Amo is remembered as the first philosopher of African origin in Germany, yet this trailblazer has been largely erased from European intellectual history.The naming of Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Strasse demands a greater appreciation of the scholar's work "as a philosopher and legal scholar, and the professional context in which he worked," wrote Anna Orinsky in the online journal, EUIdeas. "German and international historians, philosophers and scholars of many other disciplines are called upon to analyse Amo’s work," she added. But the renaming is also in honor of a symbol of Black resistance, says Andrea-Vicky Amankwaa-Birago, a Berlin-based cultural scientist focused on decolonization across Germany and Ghana."This renaming signals a change in how we remember — placing Black history, achievement, and resilience at the center," she wrote in August 2025 for internet publication, Medium.The long journey to Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-StrasseThe M-Strasse subway station was itself renamed in 1991, in the wake of reunification. It had previously been called Otto-Grotewohl-Strasse after a GDR politician.The use of the racist name was called out at the time by the pioneering Black German activist May Ayim, a poet of Ghanaian descent who co-founded the Initiative of Black People in Germany in 1986 and edited the defining book "Showing Our Colors: Afro-German Women Speak Out." Ayim pursued her efforts to reveal the coded racism in reunified Germany. In the 1990s, she was outspoken in her opposition to the street name, which in her view stood for the fact that Germany's Black community was not included in the country's essentially white reunification process after the fall of the Berlin Wall.In 2010, a Kreuzberg riverfront was renamed after Ayim, who died in 1996. It was one of the first acts of decolonization, the shore having been named after Otto Friedrich von der Groeben, who in the late 17th century founded the Brandenburg-Prussian colony in Ghana.

Is Africa becoming the US's dumping ground of migrants?

Under President Trump's immigration policies, the US is deporting migrants to African nations, including Uganda, Eswatini, and South Sudan, despite concerns over human rights and the capacity of these countries to host more refugees. These deals, framed as temporary arrangements, have sparked controversy and raised questions about the benefits for the host nations, with Nigeria rejecting the proposal outright.

Under President Trump's immigration policies, the US is deporting migrants to African nations, including Uganda, Eswatini, and South Sudan, despite concerns over human rights and the capacity of these countries to host more refugees. These deals, framed as temporary arrangements, have sparked controversy and raised questions about the benefits for the host nations, with Nigeria rejecting the proposal outright. AP file photo  US President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration is a cornerstone of his domestic policy, forming part of his controversial campaign pledge to carry out "the largest deportation operation in American history."Deporting those migrants to African countries, however, was not part of the original plan he announced when he ran for the presidency in 2024.But the US Department of Homeland Security said in June that third-country deportations — i.e. sending undocumented migrants from the US to countries other than their own — were necessary to expel people "so uniquely barbaric that their own countries won't take them back." Uganda has now become the latest country in East Africa to accept a deal with Washington, pledging to take in a yet to-be-specified number of migrants who do not qualify to remain in the United States.Alex Vines, the head of the Africa Programme at Chatham House, a renowned think-tank in London, highlights that this agreement builds on schemes between the US with other African nations adopted earlier in the year."In July [2025], a small number of individuals were sent to South Sudan and Eswatini. These were less than ten in total, but it shows the direction of travel", Vines told DW. "The Uganda deal is a lot more ambitious.""The Ugandans themselves have said they would not accept people with criminal records or minors, and preferred Africans as the ones they would accept," Vines further pointed out, raising questions about the purpose of the scheme.Uganda: a stretched-out refugee nationJust days prior to the confirmation of the deal, Uganda's state minister for foreign affairs, Henry Oryem Okello, claimed the country did not have the capabilities to take in migrants.But after initially denying the deal with the US government, Vincent Bagiire, the permanent secretary of Uganda's Foreign Affairs Ministry, confirmed the deal while saying it was only a "temporary arrangement." Uganda already hosts the largest refugee population in Africa, with roughly 1.7 million people housed in various camps across the country, according to the United Nations.These are for the most part asylum-seekers and recognized refugees, who hail from other countries in the region such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Sudan.For the most part, these immigrant communities live peacefully alongside the local population — but some think this might change:"Uganda is a hospitable country, hosting many refugees. That is not a big thing to us. But already as a host country, we are choking," says Dorcus Kimono, a local living in the capital, Kampala."If these migrants are coming to our country, we would not mind sharing the little we have with them. But what is the American government doing for us?"Alex Wandeba, another resident of Kampala, shares her views: "Uganda is already overburdened; we have many refugees from the neighboring countries. I feel we have enough on the table."Kimono meanwhile wonders how Ugandans will ultimately benefit from the agreement with the United States:"I would want to hear [that if] a deal is reached with our government, that the US is constructing roads, or they are going to help us in the health and education sector. That would be a good deal.”Eswatini: a kingdom with no rightsThough prior US administrations have also conducted third-country removals, the Trump's practice of sending immigrants to countries with considerable political and human rights crises have raised alarm among human rights' groups.This was particularly notable last month, when the US flew five immigrants from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Yemen and Cuba to Eswatini — the last absolute monarchy in Africa, which is known for its troubling rights record.Eswatini has been ruled by Mswati III since 1986. The monarch leads a life of luxury while the population of 1,2 million of the landlocked nation remains poor.The country has a deteriorating human rights record, according to Human Rights Watch and according to reports penned by the US State Department itself, as recently as 2023.Political Activist Mphandlana Shongwe says there is widespread public anger in Eswatini about the king's decision to allow those immigrants into the country, which appears to fall on deaf ears. "We condemn the bringing of hardcore convicts to our country to mix with our young convicts, who still have a chance to be rehabilitated," Shongwe told DW.Government spokesperson Thabile Mdluli meanwhile assured the public that the five inmates "pose no threat to the country or its citizens," as they were being kept in isolation, at least for now.South Sudan: war-torn and unsafeConflict-torn South Sudan meanwhile has also agreed to accept immigrants sent by the Trump administration.Edmund Yakani, President of the East African Civil Society Organizations Forum, told DW that details of the deal were being kept hidden from the public.Alex Vines meanwhile believes that it's all about geopolitics. "It is about these countries looking at how to diversify their partnerships and engender improved relationships with the Trump administration that might carry money and other benefits longer term to them," he said. "South Sudan is very much in the crosshairs of the current US administration visa strategy of restricting access to the US because of [a history of] overstay of South Sudanese", Vines further explained, adding that there is also the issue of the US tariffs, which "may be reduced, although that has not impacted these countries particularly."Rwanda: acting out of good will?Rwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makolor confirmed that her country would also take up to 250 deportees from the US under the provision that the government maintains "the ability to approve each individual proposed for resettlement" under the agreement.Elaborating on why Rwanda accepted the US deal, Makolo stated the agreement meant that the African country was doing its part to help with international migration issues because "our societal values are founded on reintegration and rehabilitation."Other African nations that are known to have been approached by the US for deporatation deals include Liberia, Senegal, Gabon, Mauretania and Guinea-Bissau.Nigeria has explicitly rejected any proposal by the US, with its Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar saying the country already had "enough of its own problems."

According to official figures, more than 800,000 people donated blood in Saudi Arabia in 2024.The initiative reflects HRH the Crown Prince’s commitment to humanitarian work and the Saudi leadership’s support for national healthcare efforts, with the goal of reaching 100 percent voluntary blood donation. The campaign aligns with Saudi Vision 2030 and its focus on building a healthy and vibrant society. A single donation, the campaign noted, can help save lives by providing blood, plasma, or platelets.Applauding the crown prince’s gesture, the Ministry of Health posted on X: “The Leader’s Giving ... A Role Model for the Nation. The donation of His Highness #Crown_Prince is a humanitarian message to establish blood donation as a national value, support the voluntary work system in the health sector, and ensure the provision of safe blood supplies to meet the need.”Minister of Health Fahad Al-Jalajel thanked the Crown Prince for his generous blood donation and for his ongoing, “unlimited support for humanitarian work through the launch of the blood donation campaign.” He stated that the initiative embodies a firm commitment to promoting a culture of giving and community solidarity, and to raising the rate of voluntary blood donations to support the health sector.Al-Jalajel added that the campaign is an extension of other humanitarian initiatives undertaken by the Saudi leadership, including the Crown Prince and King Salman being among the first to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and registering in the national organ donation program. “These initiatives reflect a solid approach to healthcare and improving quality of life,” said the minister, who also called on all members of society to donate blood.Officials described HRH the Crown Prince’s donation as a significant humanitarian gesture that reinforces community awareness, sets an inspiring example, and motivates individuals to embrace a culture of giving and contribute to saving lives through voluntary initiatives.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

US envoy to India: Trump picks Sergio Gor. Why did Musk call him ‘a snake’ once?

Sergio Gor, a close aide to Donald Trump, has been nominated as the US Ambassador to India, sparking controversy due to past clashes with Elon Musk. Musk previously labeled Gor a "snake" and accused him of legal violations related to security clearance paperwork. Trump defended Gor, emphasizing his loyalty and importance to US-India relations amidst ongoing tariff disputes.

Musk previously labeled Gor a "snake" and accused him of legal violations related to security clearance paperwork. Trump defended Gor, emphasizing his loyalty and importance to US-India relations amidst ongoing tariff disputes. File photo: Elon Musk (left) and Sergio Gor (Picture credit: AP, X) Sergio Gor, a close aide to US President Donald Trump, has been nominated as the next US Ambassador to India and special envoy for South and Central Asian Affairs.However, amid the buzz of his announcement, his past clashes with Elon Musk have resurfaced and brought focus on his stormy history with the Tesla founder. Back in June, Musk branded Gor “a snake” after the New York Post revealed he had failed to submit his full security clearance paperwork despite being responsible for vetting thousands of appointees. Musk also accused him of “breaking the law” by not filing the Standard Form 86 (SF-86), required for security clearance background checks.According to the Daily Beast, Gor allegedly persuaded Trump to withdraw Musk’s close friend Jared Isaacman’s nomination to lead Nasa, days before Senate confirmation. Musk said Gor orchestrated Isaacman’s downfall to settle scores, following a confrontation during his stint on Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which aimed to slash federal spending. Musk, who quit DOGE in May, later criticised Gor for delays in staffing and clashed with him during cost-cutting reviews.According to the Post, Gor held a grudge after Musk, then serving on Trump’s task force, publicly criticised him. “Sergio was upset about Elon dressing him down at the meeting and said he was going to ‘get him,’” a source told the outlet. The tensions likely added to Musk’s rupture with Trump in early June, when he opposed the president’s sweeping tax-cut and spending bill, warning it would worsen federal debt. Days later, Musk briefly backed impeachment, prompting Trump to threaten cancellation of federal contracts with his companies.Announcing the decision on social media, Trump described Gor as “a great friend, who has been at my side for many years,” and said his appointment to New Delhi was vital at a time when Washington and New Delhi are locked in a bitter tariff dispute.“For the most populous region in the world, it is important that I have someone I can fully trust to deliver on my agenda and help us make America great again. Sergio will make an incredible Ambassador,” the president said.He highlighted Gor’s role in his campaigns, book publishing ventures, and super PACs, calling his service “essential” to the administration. Vice President JD Vance and US foreign secretary Marco Rubio also welcomed the appointment, with Rubio describing US–India relations as “the most important relationship.”Gor, 38, currently heads the White House Presidential Personnel Office, overseeing the recruitment of nearly 4,000 federal officials. He will continue in that role until the Senate confirms his appointment. In a post on X, Gor said he was “beyond grateful” to Trump for his trust, calling the ambassadorship “the honour of my life.”Gor will replace Eric Garcetti. His appointment comes as India grapples with 50 per cent US tariffs on its goods, including penalties linked to Russian oil purchases.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

‘I am the one who got them out’: Trump claims less than 20 Israeli hostages still alive, says ‘couple of them not around any longer’

Donald Trump's claim that fewer than 20 hostages remain alive in Gaza has sparked outrage from families and a swift denial from Israel's hostage negotiator. Trump asserted credit for releasing "hundreds" of hostages, a figure disputed by facts. Israeli officials maintain that 50 hostages are still held, with 20 believed to be alive, while denouncing Hamas's "extortion" tactics.

Donald Trump's claim that fewer than 20 hostages remain alive in Gaza has sparked outrage from families and a swift denial from Israel's hostage negotiator. Trump asserted credit for releasing "hundreds" of hostages, a figure disputed by facts. Israeli officials maintain that 50 hostages are still held, with 20 believed to be alive, while denouncing Hamas's "extortion" tactics. AP file photo  US President Donald Trump said that fewer than 20 hostages held in Gaza remain alive, a remark that has drawn anguish from families of the captives and was promptly denied by Israel’s hostage negotiator. “So now they have 20,” Trump said while speaking to reporters at the Oval Office on Friday. “But the 20 is actually probably not 20 because a couple of them are not around any longer.”“And you have to understand, I’m the one who got all of the hostages out,” Trump said, claiming credit for the release of “hundreds” of captives, even though fewer than 150 remained in Gaza when he assumed office on January 20, reported the Times of Israel.Following his remarks, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum released a statement that read, “Mr. President, there are 50 hostages. For us, each and every one of them is a world in itself.”Trump also claimed credit for securing releases during the January-March ceasefire, denounced Hamas’s “extortion” and outlined ongoing efforts to recover the rest of the hostages.“The situation has to end, it’s extortion and it has to end,” Trump said, referring to Hamas’s hostage-taking and negotiations. He added that he believes it would be “safer, in many ways,” to free the captives through a military operation rather than a deal with Hamas. “We’re doing everything we can to get the hostages out, it’s not easy,” he added.Israel’s ministry refutes claimsIsrael’s coordinator for hostage affairs, Gal Hirsch, said in a statement following Trump’s remarks that, “according to the information we have, there is no change in the number of living hostages,”. “Twenty of the hostages are alive, two [others] are in grave danger for their lives, 28 are no longer alive and have been declared deceased,” he wrote to the families.Trump was also questioned about why the United States seems to support Israel’s move to seize control of Gaza City, despite opposition from the families of the hostages who fear the move could endanger their loved ones. “Not all of them,” Trump replied, seemingly pointing to a minority of hostage relatives who support Israel’s expanded operation in Gaza.Israeli officials maintain that 50 hostages are being held in Gaza, 49 of the 251 abducted during the Hamas-led assault on October 7, 2023, along with one captive taken earlier. 28 among them have been confirmed dead by the IDF, and authorities believe 20 hostages are still alive. The condition of two others remain in serious doubt. Hamas is also reportedly holding the body of an IDF soldier killed in Gaza in 2014, as per the Times of Israel. Earlier this week, Israel advanced further into Gaza, pressing ahead with its plan to seize the territory while simultaneously approving thousands of new housing units in the occupied West Bank, steps that drew international concern and renewed debate over the prospects of a Palestinian state.Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin, the IDF’s chief spokesperson, announced that Israel “has begun the next phase of the war,” noting that troops had reached the outskirts of Gaza City and were preparing to relocate displaced residents to southern Gaza, reported The New York Times.More than 62,000 people have been killed in the besieged Gaza Strip since the start of the conflict, as per Gaza’s health ministry.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

San Francisco: ICE clashes with protesters; charge knife-wielding suspect

A mob ambushed ICE officers in San Francisco, with one assailant, Adrian Guerrero, threatening to stab an officer and target his family. Guerrero, armed with a knife, allegedly slashed a government vehicle's tire before confronting the agents, resulting in charges of assault and property destruction.

A mob ambushed ICE officers in San Francisco, with one assailant, Adrian Guerrero, threatening to stab an officer and target his family. Guerrero, armed with a knife, allegedly slashed a government vehicle's tire before confronting the agents, resulting in charges of assault and property destruction. San Francisco: ICE clashes with protesters; charge knife-wielding suspect (Picture credit: DHS) Federal authorities on Friday said US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers clashed with protesters in San Francisco this week, with one knife-wielding suspect now facing charges after allegedly threatening to stab an officer and target his family. The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirmed the incident happened on Wednesday outside 100 Montgomery Street, where ICE agents were carrying out immigration enforcement. Around 15–20 demonstrators surrounded four officers, spraying pepper spray and physically assaulting them. One officer sustained a jammed finger, while others suffered irritation from chemical spray, DHS said. Court filings cited by the New York Post identified the suspect as Adrian Guerrero, a US citizen. He has been charged with assaulting an officer and destruction of property. Guerrero is accused of slashing the tire of a government-marked Chevrolet earlier that morning before confronting ICE agents. While wielding a black knife and wearing a patterned keffiyeh-style scarf with tinted goggles, Guerrero allegedly shouted, “I’m going to f** you up. I’m going to go after your family. I’m going to stab you.” Photos cited in the complaint show Guerrero confronting agents, reported the New York Post. He was arrested still carrying the knife and clothing described. Federal Protective Services and San Francisco police later arrived to help disperse the crowd. According to KQED, confrontations with protesters began earlier that morning near the immigration courthouse. An ICE officer pepper-sprayed both a protester and a reporter, who said he was filming the incident when an officer grabbed a bicycle handle and sprayed without provocation. “It wasn’t provoked … There were no aggressive movements other than me approaching the scene,” the journalist was quoted as saying by KQED. At least one protester was later detained outside ICE’s Sansome Street field office after being tackled, zip-tied, and taken inside.KQED reported that an ICE officer also fired a weapon that released white powder during a scuffle involving a protester and a bike. The confrontation eventually dispersed, though many protesters regrouped at the courthouse midmorning. Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem condemned the assault, saying ICE officers now face a “1,000% increase in assaults” while targeting dangerous offenders. “These acts of violence are fuelled by sanctuary politicians’ rhetoric vilifying our law enforcement,” she said in a DHS statement. “We will not and have not let this violence stop us or slow us down”, she added. The attack follows other violent confrontations with federal agents. In July, ten armed men in tactical gear opened fire on an ICE detention centre near Dallas, where all suspects were later charged with attempted murder, according to the New York Post.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

(Picture credit: AP) Lyle Menendez, one of the two brothers convicted of murdering their wealthy parents in Beverly Hills more than three decades ago, has been denied parole by a California state panel.The 57-year-old, who uses his middle name Joseph, appeared by video from a San Diego prison on Friday for his first parole hearing since being resentenced earlier this year. After an 11-hour closed-door session, commissioners decided he must remain behind bars for at least three more years, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. “Joseph (Lyle) Menendez was denied parole for three years at his initial suitability hearing today,” the department said in a statement, as cited by news agency AFP.The ruling follows Thursday’s decision in the case of his younger brother, Erik, 54, whose parole was also rejected. The siblings, convicted in 1996 of killing Jose and Kitty Menendez with shotguns in 1989, were originally sentenced to life without parole. A Los Angeles judge reduced those terms in May to 50 years to life, making them eligible for release as they were under 26 at the time of the crime, as per news agency AP.The Menendez case first shocked America in 1989, when Lyle, then 21, and Erik, 18, killed their parents inside their Beverly Hills mansion. They initially told investigators it was linked to their father’s business or the Mafia, but two months later Erik confessed to a psychologist that he and his brother were responsible. The brothers were arrested in 1990 and later charged with first-degree murder. Prosecutors said the motive was greed, while the defence argued they acted after years of sexual and emotional abuse, as per AP.Their first trials in the early 1990s ended with hung juries, but in 1995 they were convicted of murder, along with lying in wait and special circumstances allegations. They were sentenced the following year to life without parole. For decades, appeals were denied by state and federal courts.While in prison, the brothers engaged in education, led self-help classes, and even launched a prison beautification project inspired by Norway’s rehabilitation model, according to AP. Their case has also drawn renewed public attention through true-crime shows, including Netflix’s nine-episode series Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story.As per The New York Times, Friday’s hearing was Lyle’s first chance at release, though parole boards rarely grant freedom at an initial review. Both brothers will be eligible for new hearings in three years but could also pursue clemency from California Governor Gavin Newsom or continue legal challenges.According to AP, the parole board weighs whether inmates pose an “unreasonable risk of danger to society” if freed, considering their criminal history, motivation, remorse, behaviour in prison and reentry plans. Nearly all of the Menendez family members have backed their release; their uncle Milton Andersen, one of the few who opposed it, died earlier this year.Though formally denied parole for three years, the brothers may be reviewed sooner, with administrative reconsideration possible within a year and another hearing in as little as 18 months. They also still have a pending habeas corpus petition, filed in May 2023, that seeks to reopen their convictions based on new evidence supporting their claims of sexual abuse by their father.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Multiple agencies, including the EPA and LDEQ, are responding to the incident, monitoring air quality, and providing support. Massive fire erupts at Louisiana auto supply plant A powerful explosion and fire at an automotive supply company in southeast Louisiana forced evacuations on Friday, sending huge flames and a towering column of thick black smoke into the sky above rural communities.The blaze broke out at Smitty’s Supply, a plant that manufactures lubricants and automotive fluids, just north of the town of Roseland in Tangipahoa Parish, according to news agency AP. Local officials said no injuries have been reported, but everyone living within a one-mile radius was ordered to leave their homes. A nearby elementary school was also evacuated.Tangipahoa Parish President Robby Miller said it was a “godsend” that no one had been hurt. “We are doing our best to protect people, structures and the environment,” he told reporters, as crews spent hours battling the inferno, reported AP.Videos of the incident going viral on social media showed bright orange flames leaping through the facility, contrasted against a thick black plume of smoke visible for miles. More than 35 agencies, including the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), responded to the emergency.LDEQ said it was monitoring air quality around the site. “All readings are zero at this time,” the agency stated, adding that the EPA had dispatched contractors for additional support, as per The Independent.The Tangipahoa Parish School System confirmed that Roseland Montessori School had been evacuated, with students bussed to a reunification site at the central office. “We are relieved to report that all Roseland Montessori students and staff have been accounted for and have returned home safe and sound,” superintendent Melissa Martin Stilley said, as cited by The Independent.According to Fox 26 Houston, the fire was first reported shortly before 1 pm CST. Multiple nearby roads were closed, and a shelter was opened at the Amite Community Center on West Chestnut Street to assist evacuees.Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry posted on X that the situation was being closely monitored. “We are praying for everyone’s safety,” he wrote.Authorities said the cause of the explosion remains under investigation, and it is unclear how long it will take to bring the fire fully under control.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Driver distracted? New York City tour bus crash kills five – Indians among passengers

A tour bus accident on Interstate 90 near Pembroke, New York, resulted in five fatalities and numerous injuries. The bus, carrying 54 people from Niagara Falls to New York City, overturned when the driver became distracted and lost control. Most passengers were of Indian, Chinese, and Filipino descent. Investigations are ongoing, with distraction identified as the likely cause.

A tour bus accident on Interstate 90 near Pembroke, New York, resulted in five fatalities and numerous injuries. The bus, carrying 54 people from Niagara Falls to New York City, overturned when the driver became distracted and lost control. Most passengers were of Indian, Chinese, and Filipino descent. Investigations are ongoing, with distraction identified as the likely cause.  A tour bus carrying 54 people from Niagara Falls to New York City overturned on Interstate 90 near Pembroke, New York, on Friday afternoon, killing five passengers and injuring dozens more. Authorities say the driver became distracted and lost control before overcorrecting, causing the bus to veer off the road and roll onto its side, news agency AP reported.Major Andre Ray of the New York State Police confirmed that the dead were all adults, with passengers ranging in age from one to 74. Many victims were thrown from the vehicle, and several became trapped beneath the wreckage before being pulled to safety. Rescue operations continued for hours, with helicopters and ambulances transporting more than 40 people to nearby hospitals.'Became distracted, lost control'Police said mechanical failure and driver impairment have been ruled out, making distraction the most likely cause of the crash. “The operator became distracted, lost control and overcorrected,” Ray explained, as quoted by AP.The bus, operated by M&Y Tour Inc. of Staten Island, had no record of previous accidents in the past two years and carried a “satisfactory” federal safety rating. The driver survived and is cooperating with investigators.The National Transportation Safety Board has dispatched a team to assist in examining the crash, which occurred around 12:30 p.m. on the busy New York State Thruway. Witnesses reported seeing the bus swerve into the median before crossing to the shoulder and overturning.Many victims from India, China and the PhilippinesAuthorities said most of the passengers were of Indian, Chinese and Filipino background, and translators were brought to the scene to aid emergency services. Lists provided by the company confirmed 54 people were on board, including the driver and a tour company employee.At Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo, 24 patients were treated for serious trauma, including head injuries and broken bones. “It’s probably the most trauma patients from one incident in my career here in Buffalo,” said Dr Samuel Cloud, the hospital’s chief medical officer. Other patients were flown to the University of Rochester Medical Center, where two remained in critical condition.Officials believe many passengers were not wearing seat belts at the time. New York law requires seat belt use on charter buses built after November 2016, though the age of the bus has not been confirmed.Shock and mourningGovernor Kathy Hochul described the accident as a “tragedy” and said her office was working closely with police and local officials. “Our hearts are with their loved ones during this difficult time,” she said.Eyewitnesses reported seeing shattered glass and belongings scattered across the highway. “It was heartbreaking to see. People were embracing each other, breaking down,” said Powell Stephens, who drove past the scene.The crash left eastbound lanes of the Thruway closed for hours as investigators worked to clear the wreckage.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Russia-Ukraine conflict: Moscow captures 2 villages in Donetsk region; advances towards Ukrainian logistics base

Russian forces have intensified their military campaign in Ukraine's Donetsk region, claiming the capture of Sredneye and Kleban-Byk. This advance brings Russian troops closer to Kostyantynivka, a strategically important town on the route to Kramatorsk. Kramatorsk serves as a vital logistics hub for Ukrainian forces, potentially disrupting supply lines if the advance continues.

Kramatorsk serves as a vital logistics hub for Ukrainian forces, potentially disrupting supply lines if the advance continues. Representative Image (AI-generated)  Russia on Saturday announced that its forces had captured two villages in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, increasing military pressure as international efforts to end the conflict continue.Moscow's defence ministry said on Telegram that its troops had taken control of Sredneye and Kleban-Byk. The capture of Kleban-Byk advances Russian forces closer to the town of Kostyantynivka — a key point on the route to Kramatorsk, which serves as a major Ukrainian logistics hub.Russian forces are advancing slowly in the embattled eastern region, grinding closer to Kyiv’s defensive line in costly metre-for-metre battles.On Friday, Russia reported that its troops had captured three additional villages in the Donetsk region, which it claims to have annexed in September 2022.The latest Russian advances come as hopes dim for a summit between Russian and Ukrainian presidents — a solution pushed by US President Donald Trump as part of his efforts to end the conflict.Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday said that "no meeting" is planned, signaling a stall in Trump’s mediation efforts. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has also accused Russia of attempting to prolong the offensive.Trump had also told reporters on Friday that he would make an "important" decision in two weeks regarding Ukraine peace efforts, suggesting that Moscow could face massive sanctions — or he might "do nothing."About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Racist Berlin street name to change after legal battle

Berlin's Mohrenstrasse, a street with a racist name rooted in Germany's colonial past, was slated to be renamed after Anton Wilhelm Amo, the first African-born scholar to earn a European doctorate. Despite years of lobbying and legal battles, residents initially blocked the change, but the courts ultimately upheld the renaming.

Berlin's Mohrenstrasse, a street with a racist name rooted in Germany's colonial past, was slated to be renamed after Anton Wilhelm Amo, the first African-born scholar to earn a European doctorate. Despite years of lobbying and legal battles, residents initially blocked the change, but the courts ultimately upheld the renaming. AP file photo  "Decolonization does not happen by changing a few street names," political scientist and human rights activist Joshua Kwesi Aikins told DW after it was announced on Friday that a central Berlin street will not have its racist name changed after all. The road had been slated to be renamed in honor of Anton Wilhelm Amo, a Black German Enlightenment philosopher, who in 1734 became the first Africa-born scholar to receive a European doctorate.That was in 2020. At the time, the district council of Berlin-Mitte had approved the renaming, but before it was implemented, residents filed a lawsuit against it.But five years later, in July this year, the Higher Administrative Court of Berlin-Brandenburg upheld a decision by the Berlin Administrative Court stating that residents have no basis to take legal action against the name change.Signs had already been installed, and the change was to be officialized through a symbolic unveiling on Saturday, August 23, which also marks International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition. Though the group "Pro Mohrenstraße" made a last-ditch legal attempt to block the name change, the Berlin-Brandenburg court again upheld its ruling to allow for the name change.Dividing up Africa from BerlinSeveral civil society groups have lobbied for decades to change the name of Mohren or "Moor" Street (respectfully referred to as M-Strasse), and the U-Bahn station of the same name.Moor, in its Greek roots, means dark or black, but also "stupid or primitive," Aikins said.M-Strasse runs through the old quarter of the former Prussian city, steps away from the rebuilt Berlin Palace, which oversaw colonial forays into Africa, and near the former chancellor's residence and venue for the 1884-1885 Berlin Conference.In the words of Berlin-based British-Ugandan writer Musa Okwonga, the major European colonial powers that gathered for the conference "discussed how they might divide up Africa." The conference kickstarted Germany's genocidal colonial rule in Namibia. The M-word's overt racist connotations further derive from the 18th-century practice of bringing enslaved Africans to Germany as "court moors" to work as servants or entertain the Brandenburg electors and Prussian kings as musicians. "The street name given at the beginning of the 18th century transports this racist experience of violence against Black people in Berlin to the present day," wrote historian Christian Kopp of Decolonize Berlin-Mitte.These slaves were mostly brought from the Brandenburg-Prussian colony in current-day Ghana (then known as the Brandenburger Gold Coast), which existed from 1682 to 1721.Who was Anton Wilhelm Amo?Anton Wilhelm Amo himself was enslaved as a boy in Ghana and taken to Amsterdam around 1703. He was then gifted to the German Duke of Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel in 1707, the year M-Strasse was named.Encouraged to study by the Duke, who paid for his education, Amo went on to become the first African-born scholar in Europe to complete a PhD in 1734.Despite Amo's displacement, he embraced his German identity while never forgetting his African heritage. Amo's thesis in law at the University of Halle is lost but was titled "The Rights of Blacks in Europe," which looked at the legal rights of People of Color in the continent.It is said that Amo learned six languages. He later wrote a second doctoral thesis in philosophy that weighed in on philosopher Rene Descartes and his ideas about the duality between mind and body. He also taught classes at the universities in Halle and nearby Jena, but made a meager living before returning to Ghana in 1747. The date of his death is unknown.Amo is remembered as the first philosopher of African origin in Germany, yet this trailblazer has been largely erased from European intellectual history.The naming of Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Strasse demands a greater appreciation of the scholar's work "as a philosopher and legal scholar, and the professional context in which he worked," wrote Anna Orinsky in the online journal, EUIdeas. "German and international historians, philosophers and scholars of many other disciplines are called upon to analyse Amo’s work," she added. But the renaming is also in honor of a symbol of Black resistance, says Andrea-Vicky Amankwaa-Birago, a Berlin-based cultural scientist focused on decolonization across Germany and Ghana."This renaming signals a change in how we remember — placing Black history, achievement, and resilience at the center," she wrote in August 2025 for internet publication, Medium.The long journey to Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-StrasseThe M-Strasse subway station was itself renamed in 1991, in the wake of reunification. It had previously been called Otto-Grotewohl-Strasse after a GDR politician.The use of the racist name was called out at the time by the pioneering Black German activist May Ayim, a poet of Ghanaian descent who co-founded the Initiative of Black People in Germany in 1986 and edited the defining book "Showing Our Colors: Afro-German Women Speak Out." Ayim pursued her efforts to reveal the coded racism in reunified Germany. In the 1990s, she was outspoken in her opposition to the street name, which in her view stood for the fact that Germany's Black community was not included in the country's essentially white reunification process after the fall of the Berlin Wall.In 2010, a Kreuzberg riverfront was renamed after Ayim, who died in 1996. It was one of the first acts of decolonization, the shore having been named after Otto Friedrich von der Groeben, who in the late 17th century founded the Brandenburg-Prussian colony in Ghana.

Is Africa becoming the US's dumping ground of migrants?

Under President Trump's immigration policies, the US is deporting migrants to African nations, including Uganda, Eswatini, and South Sudan, despite concerns over human rights and the capacity of these countries to host more refugees. These deals, framed as temporary arrangements, have sparked controversy and raised questions about the benefits for the host nations, with Nigeria rejecting the proposal outright.

Under President Trump's immigration policies, the US is deporting migrants to African nations, including Uganda, Eswatini, and South Sudan, despite concerns over human rights and the capacity of these countries to host more refugees. These deals, framed as temporary arrangements, have sparked controversy and raised questions about the benefits for the host nations, with Nigeria rejecting the proposal outright. AP file photo  US President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration is a cornerstone of his domestic policy, forming part of his controversial campaign pledge to carry out "the largest deportation operation in American history."Deporting those migrants to African countries, however, was not part of the original plan he announced when he ran for the presidency in 2024.But the US Department of Homeland Security said in June that third-country deportations — i.e. sending undocumented migrants from the US to countries other than their own — were necessary to expel people "so uniquely barbaric that their own countries won't take them back." Uganda has now become the latest country in East Africa to accept a deal with Washington, pledging to take in a yet to-be-specified number of migrants who do not qualify to remain in the United States.Alex Vines, the head of the Africa Programme at Chatham House, a renowned think-tank in London, highlights that this agreement builds on schemes between the US with other African nations adopted earlier in the year."In July [2025], a small number of individuals were sent to South Sudan and Eswatini. These were less than ten in total, but it shows the direction of travel", Vines told DW. "The Uganda deal is a lot more ambitious.""The Ugandans themselves have said they would not accept people with criminal records or minors, and preferred Africans as the ones they would accept," Vines further pointed out, raising questions about the purpose of the scheme.Uganda: a stretched-out refugee nationJust days prior to the confirmation of the deal, Uganda's state minister for foreign affairs, Henry Oryem Okello, claimed the country did not have the capabilities to take in migrants.But after initially denying the deal with the US government, Vincent Bagiire, the permanent secretary of Uganda's Foreign Affairs Ministry, confirmed the deal while saying it was only a "temporary arrangement." Uganda already hosts the largest refugee population in Africa, with roughly 1.7 million people housed in various camps across the country, according to the United Nations.These are for the most part asylum-seekers and recognized refugees, who hail from other countries in the region such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Sudan.For the most part, these immigrant communities live peacefully alongside the local population — but some think this might change:"Uganda is a hospitable country, hosting many refugees. That is not a big thing to us. But already as a host country, we are choking," says Dorcus Kimono, a local living in the capital, Kampala."If these migrants are coming to our country, we would not mind sharing the little we have with them. But what is the American government doing for us?"Alex Wandeba, another resident of Kampala, shares her views: "Uganda is already overburdened; we have many refugees from the neighboring countries. I feel we have enough on the table."Kimono meanwhile wonders how Ugandans will ultimately benefit from the agreement with the United States:"I would want to hear [that if] a deal is reached with our government, that the US is constructing roads, or they are going to help us in the health and education sector. That would be a good deal.”Eswatini: a kingdom with no rightsThough prior US administrations have also conducted third-country removals, the Trump's practice of sending immigrants to countries with considerable political and human rights crises have raised alarm among human rights' groups.This was particularly notable last month, when the US flew five immigrants from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Yemen and Cuba to Eswatini — the last absolute monarchy in Africa, which is known for its troubling rights record.Eswatini has been ruled by Mswati III since 1986. The monarch leads a life of luxury while the population of 1,2 million of the landlocked nation remains poor.The country has a deteriorating human rights record, according to Human Rights Watch and according to reports penned by the US State Department itself, as recently as 2023.Political Activist Mphandlana Shongwe says there is widespread public anger in Eswatini about the king's decision to allow those immigrants into the country, which appears to fall on deaf ears. "We condemn the bringing of hardcore convicts to our country to mix with our young convicts, who still have a chance to be rehabilitated," Shongwe told DW.Government spokesperson Thabile Mdluli meanwhile assured the public that the five inmates "pose no threat to the country or its citizens," as they were being kept in isolation, at least for now.South Sudan: war-torn and unsafeConflict-torn South Sudan meanwhile has also agreed to accept immigrants sent by the Trump administration.Edmund Yakani, President of the East African Civil Society Organizations Forum, told DW that details of the deal were being kept hidden from the public.Alex Vines meanwhile believes that it's all about geopolitics. "It is about these countries looking at how to diversify their partnerships and engender improved relationships with the Trump administration that might carry money and other benefits longer term to them," he said. "South Sudan is very much in the crosshairs of the current US administration visa strategy of restricting access to the US because of [a history of] overstay of South Sudanese", Vines further explained, adding that there is also the issue of the US tariffs, which "may be reduced, although that has not impacted these countries particularly."Rwanda: acting out of good will?Rwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makolor confirmed that her country would also take up to 250 deportees from the US under the provision that the government maintains "the ability to approve each individual proposed for resettlement" under the agreement.Elaborating on why Rwanda accepted the US deal, Makolo stated the agreement meant that the African country was doing its part to help with international migration issues because "our societal values are founded on reintegration and rehabilitation."Other African nations that are known to have been approached by the US for deporatation deals include Liberia, Senegal, Gabon, Mauretania and Guinea-Bissau.Nigeria has explicitly rejected any proposal by the US, with its Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar saying the country already had "enough of its own problems."

US envoy to India: Trump picks Sergio Gor. Why did Musk call him ‘a snake’ once?

Sergio Gor, a close aide to Donald Trump, has been nominated as the US Ambassador to India, sparking controversy due to past clashes with Elon Musk. Musk previously labeled Gor a "snake" and accused him of legal violations related to security clearance paperwork. Trump defended Gor, emphasizing his loyalty and importance to US-India relations amidst ongoing tariff disputes.

Musk previously labeled Gor a "snake" and accused him of legal violations related to security clearance paperwork. Trump defended Gor, emphasizing his loyalty and importance to US-India relations amidst ongoing tariff disputes. File photo: Elon Musk (left) and Sergio Gor (Picture credit: AP, X) Sergio Gor, a close aide to US President Donald Trump, has been nominated as the next US Ambassador to India and special envoy for South and Central Asian Affairs.However, amid the buzz of his announcement, his past clashes with Elon Musk have resurfaced and brought focus on his stormy history with the Tesla founder. Back in June, Musk branded Gor “a snake” after the New York Post revealed he had failed to submit his full security clearance paperwork despite being responsible for vetting thousands of appointees. Musk also accused him of “breaking the law” by not filing the Standard Form 86 (SF-86), required for security clearance background checks.According to the Daily Beast, Gor allegedly persuaded Trump to withdraw Musk’s close friend Jared Isaacman’s nomination to lead Nasa, days before Senate confirmation. Musk said Gor orchestrated Isaacman’s downfall to settle scores, following a confrontation during his stint on Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which aimed to slash federal spending. Musk, who quit DOGE in May, later criticised Gor for delays in staffing and clashed with him during cost-cutting reviews.According to the Post, Gor held a grudge after Musk, then serving on Trump’s task force, publicly criticised him. “Sergio was upset about Elon dressing him down at the meeting and said he was going to ‘get him,’” a source told the outlet. The tensions likely added to Musk’s rupture with Trump in early June, when he opposed the president’s sweeping tax-cut and spending bill, warning it would worsen federal debt. Days later, Musk briefly backed impeachment, prompting Trump to threaten cancellation of federal contracts with his companies.Announcing the decision on social media, Trump described Gor as “a great friend, who has been at my side for many years,” and said his appointment to New Delhi was vital at a time when Washington and New Delhi are locked in a bitter tariff dispute.“For the most populous region in the world, it is important that I have someone I can fully trust to deliver on my agenda and help us make America great again. Sergio will make an incredible Ambassador,” the president said.He highlighted Gor’s role in his campaigns, book publishing ventures, and super PACs, calling his service “essential” to the administration. Vice President JD Vance and US foreign secretary Marco Rubio also welcomed the appointment, with Rubio describing US–India relations as “the most important relationship.”Gor, 38, currently heads the White House Presidential Personnel Office, overseeing the recruitment of nearly 4,000 federal officials. He will continue in that role until the Senate confirms his appointment. In a post on X, Gor said he was “beyond grateful” to Trump for his trust, calling the ambassadorship “the honour of my life.”Gor will replace Eric Garcetti. His appointment comes as India grapples with 50 per cent US tariffs on its goods, including penalties linked to Russian oil purchases.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

‘I am the one who got them out’: Trump claims less than 20 Israeli hostages still alive, says ‘couple of them not around any longer’

Donald Trump's claim that fewer than 20 hostages remain alive in Gaza has sparked outrage from families and a swift denial from Israel's hostage negotiator. Trump asserted credit for releasing "hundreds" of hostages, a figure disputed by facts. Israeli officials maintain that 50 hostages are still held, with 20 believed to be alive, while denouncing Hamas's "extortion" tactics.

Donald Trump's claim that fewer than 20 hostages remain alive in Gaza has sparked outrage from families and a swift denial from Israel's hostage negotiator. Trump asserted credit for releasing "hundreds" of hostages, a figure disputed by facts. Israeli officials maintain that 50 hostages are still held, with 20 believed to be alive, while denouncing Hamas's "extortion" tactics. AP file photo  US President Donald Trump said that fewer than 20 hostages held in Gaza remain alive, a remark that has drawn anguish from families of the captives and was promptly denied by Israel’s hostage negotiator. “So now they have 20,” Trump said while speaking to reporters at the Oval Office on Friday. “But the 20 is actually probably not 20 because a couple of them are not around any longer.”“And you have to understand, I’m the one who got all of the hostages out,” Trump said, claiming credit for the release of “hundreds” of captives, even though fewer than 150 remained in Gaza when he assumed office on January 20, reported the Times of Israel.Following his remarks, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum released a statement that read, “Mr. President, there are 50 hostages. For us, each and every one of them is a world in itself.”Trump also claimed credit for securing releases during the January-March ceasefire, denounced Hamas’s “extortion” and outlined ongoing efforts to recover the rest of the hostages.“The situation has to end, it’s extortion and it has to end,” Trump said, referring to Hamas’s hostage-taking and negotiations. He added that he believes it would be “safer, in many ways,” to free the captives through a military operation rather than a deal with Hamas. “We’re doing everything we can to get the hostages out, it’s not easy,” he added.Israel’s ministry refutes claimsIsrael’s coordinator for hostage affairs, Gal Hirsch, said in a statement following Trump’s remarks that, “according to the information we have, there is no change in the number of living hostages,”. “Twenty of the hostages are alive, two [others] are in grave danger for their lives, 28 are no longer alive and have been declared deceased,” he wrote to the families.Trump was also questioned about why the United States seems to support Israel’s move to seize control of Gaza City, despite opposition from the families of the hostages who fear the move could endanger their loved ones. “Not all of them,” Trump replied, seemingly pointing to a minority of hostage relatives who support Israel’s expanded operation in Gaza.Israeli officials maintain that 50 hostages are being held in Gaza, 49 of the 251 abducted during the Hamas-led assault on October 7, 2023, along with one captive taken earlier. 28 among them have been confirmed dead by the IDF, and authorities believe 20 hostages are still alive. The condition of two others remain in serious doubt. Hamas is also reportedly holding the body of an IDF soldier killed in Gaza in 2014, as per the Times of Israel. Earlier this week, Israel advanced further into Gaza, pressing ahead with its plan to seize the territory while simultaneously approving thousands of new housing units in the occupied West Bank, steps that drew international concern and renewed debate over the prospects of a Palestinian state.Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin, the IDF’s chief spokesperson, announced that Israel “has begun the next phase of the war,” noting that troops had reached the outskirts of Gaza City and were preparing to relocate displaced residents to southern Gaza, reported The New York Times.More than 62,000 people have been killed in the besieged Gaza Strip since the start of the conflict, as per Gaza’s health ministry.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

San Francisco: ICE clashes with protesters; charge knife-wielding suspect

A mob ambushed ICE officers in San Francisco, with one assailant, Adrian Guerrero, threatening to stab an officer and target his family. Guerrero, armed with a knife, allegedly slashed a government vehicle's tire before confronting the agents, resulting in charges of assault and property destruction.

A mob ambushed ICE officers in San Francisco, with one assailant, Adrian Guerrero, threatening to stab an officer and target his family. Guerrero, armed with a knife, allegedly slashed a government vehicle's tire before confronting the agents, resulting in charges of assault and property destruction. San Francisco: ICE clashes with protesters; charge knife-wielding suspect (Picture credit: DHS) Federal authorities on Friday said US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers clashed with protesters in San Francisco this week, with one knife-wielding suspect now facing charges after allegedly threatening to stab an officer and target his family. The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirmed the incident happened on Wednesday outside 100 Montgomery Street, where ICE agents were carrying out immigration enforcement. Around 15–20 demonstrators surrounded four officers, spraying pepper spray and physically assaulting them. One officer sustained a jammed finger, while others suffered irritation from chemical spray, DHS said. Court filings cited by the New York Post identified the suspect as Adrian Guerrero, a US citizen. He has been charged with assaulting an officer and destruction of property. Guerrero is accused of slashing the tire of a government-marked Chevrolet earlier that morning before confronting ICE agents. While wielding a black knife and wearing a patterned keffiyeh-style scarf with tinted goggles, Guerrero allegedly shouted, “I’m going to f** you up. I’m going to go after your family. I’m going to stab you.” Photos cited in the complaint show Guerrero confronting agents, reported the New York Post. He was arrested still carrying the knife and clothing described. Federal Protective Services and San Francisco police later arrived to help disperse the crowd. According to KQED, confrontations with protesters began earlier that morning near the immigration courthouse. An ICE officer pepper-sprayed both a protester and a reporter, who said he was filming the incident when an officer grabbed a bicycle handle and sprayed without provocation. “It wasn’t provoked … There were no aggressive movements other than me approaching the scene,” the journalist was quoted as saying by KQED. At least one protester was later detained outside ICE’s Sansome Street field office after being tackled, zip-tied, and taken inside.KQED reported that an ICE officer also fired a weapon that released white powder during a scuffle involving a protester and a bike. The confrontation eventually dispersed, though many protesters regrouped at the courthouse midmorning. Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem condemned the assault, saying ICE officers now face a “1,000% increase in assaults” while targeting dangerous offenders. “These acts of violence are fuelled by sanctuary politicians’ rhetoric vilifying our law enforcement,” she said in a DHS statement. “We will not and have not let this violence stop us or slow us down”, she added. The attack follows other violent confrontations with federal agents. In July, ten armed men in tactical gear opened fire on an ICE detention centre near Dallas, where all suspects were later charged with attempted murder, according to the New York Post.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Day after Erik, Lyle Menendez’s freedom bid denied; board issues three-year denial

Lyle Menendez, convicted with his brother Erik for the 1989 murder of their parents, has been denied parole after his first hearing since resentencing. The decision follows a similar rejection for Erik, keeping both brothers incarcerated despite their reduced sentences.

Lyle Menendez, convicted with his brother Erik for the 1989 murder of their parents, has been denied parole after his first hearing since resentencing. The decision follows a similar rejection for Erik, keeping both brothers incarcerated despite their reduced sentences. Lyle Menendez appears before the parole board via teleconference at the Richard J Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego. (Picture credit: AP) Lyle Menendez, one of the two brothers convicted of murdering their wealthy parents in Beverly Hills more than three decades ago, has been denied parole by a California state panel.The 57-year-old, who uses his middle name Joseph, appeared by video from a San Diego prison on Friday for his first parole hearing since being resentenced earlier this year. After an 11-hour closed-door session, commissioners decided he must remain behind bars for at least three more years, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. “Joseph (Lyle) Menendez was denied parole for three years at his initial suitability hearing today,” the department said in a statement, as cited by news agency AFP.The ruling follows Thursday’s decision in the case of his younger brother, Erik, 54, whose parole was also rejected. The siblings, convicted in 1996 of killing Jose and Kitty Menendez with shotguns in 1989, were originally sentenced to life without parole. A Los Angeles judge reduced those terms in May to 50 years to life, making them eligible for release as they were under 26 at the time of the crime, as per news agency AP.The Menendez case first shocked America in 1989, when Lyle, then 21, and Erik, 18, killed their parents inside their Beverly Hills mansion. They initially told investigators it was linked to their father’s business or the Mafia, but two months later Erik confessed to a psychologist that he and his brother were responsible. The brothers were arrested in 1990 and later charged with first-degree murder. Prosecutors said the motive was greed, while the defence argued they acted after years of sexual and emotional abuse, as per AP.Their first trials in the early 1990s ended with hung juries, but in 1995 they were convicted of murder, along with lying in wait and special circumstances allegations. They were sentenced the following year to life without parole. For decades, appeals were denied by state and federal courts.While in prison, the brothers engaged in education, led self-help classes, and even launched a prison beautification project inspired by Norway’s rehabilitation model, according to AP. Their case has also drawn renewed public attention through true-crime shows, including Netflix’s nine-episode series Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story.As per The New York Times, Friday’s hearing was Lyle’s first chance at release, though parole boards rarely grant freedom at an initial review. Both brothers will be eligible for new hearings in three years but could also pursue clemency from California Governor Gavin Newsom or continue legal challenges.According to AP, the parole board weighs whether inmates pose an “unreasonable risk of danger to society” if freed, considering their criminal history, motivation, remorse, behaviour in prison and reentry plans. Nearly all of the Menendez family members have backed their release; their uncle Milton Andersen, one of the few who opposed it, died earlier this year.Though formally denied parole for three years, the brothers may be reviewed sooner, with administrative reconsideration possible within a year and another hearing in as little as 18 months. They also still have a pending habeas corpus petition, filed in May 2023, that seeks to reopen their convictions based on new evidence supporting their claims of sexual abuse by their father.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Investigations are ongoing, with distraction identified as the likely cause.  A tour bus carrying 54 people from Niagara Falls to New York City overturned on Interstate 90 near Pembroke, New York, on Friday afternoon, killing five passengers and injuring dozens more. Authorities say the driver became distracted and lost control before overcorrecting, causing the bus to veer off the road and roll onto its side, news agency AP reported.Major Andre Ray of the New York State Police confirmed that the dead were all adults, with passengers ranging in age from one to 74. Many victims were thrown from the vehicle, and several became trapped beneath the wreckage before being pulled to safety. Rescue operations continued for hours, with helicopters and ambulances transporting more than 40 people to nearby hospitals.'Became distracted, lost control'Police said mechanical failure and driver impairment have been ruled out, making distraction the most likely cause of the crash. “The operator became distracted, lost control and overcorrected,” Ray explained, as quoted by AP.The bus, operated by M&Y Tour Inc. of Staten Island, had no record of previous accidents in the past two years and carried a “satisfactory” federal safety rating. The driver survived and is cooperating with investigators.The National Transportation Safety Board has dispatched a team to assist in examining the crash, which occurred around 12:30 p.m. on the busy New York State Thruway. Witnesses reported seeing the bus swerve into the median before crossing to the shoulder and overturning.Many victims from India, China and the PhilippinesAuthorities said most of the passengers were of Indian, Chinese and Filipino background, and translators were brought to the scene to aid emergency services. Lists provided by the company confirmed 54 people were on board, including the driver and a tour company employee.At Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo, 24 patients were treated for serious trauma, including head injuries and broken bones. “It’s probably the most trauma patients from one incident in my career here in Buffalo,” said Dr Samuel Cloud, the hospital’s chief medical officer. Other patients were flown to the University of Rochester Medical Center, where two remained in critical condition.Officials believe many passengers were not wearing seat belts at the time. New York law requires seat belt use on charter buses built after November 2016, though the age of the bus has not been confirmed.Shock and mourningGovernor Kathy Hochul described the accident as a “tragedy” and said her office was working closely with police and local officials. “Our hearts are with their loved ones during this difficult time,” she said.Eyewitnesses reported seeing shattered glass and belongings scattered across the highway. “It was heartbreaking to see.
