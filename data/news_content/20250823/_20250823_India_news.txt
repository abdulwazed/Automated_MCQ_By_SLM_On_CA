Investigations revealed his direct links with a Hizb handler operating from across the border, orchestrating anti-national activities.  NEW DELHI: In a significant breakthrough, the state investigation agency (SIA) of Jammu and Kashmir Police on Saturday apprehended an over-ground worker (OGW) linked to the proscribed terrorist outfit Hizbul Mujahideen (Hizb).The arrested individual, identified as Altaf Hussain Wagay, hails from the Reban Gund area of Behram, Shopian. According to an SIA spokesperson, Wagay had been operating as a sleeper cell for Hizb and was involved in facilitating terror-related activities in the region.“Following relentless efforts, SIA Kashmir has achieved a major success by apprehending an OGW, Altaf Hussain Wagay, resident of Reban Gund area of Behram in Shopian,” the spokesperson said in a statement.The arrest was made in connection with an ongoing investigation into a terrorism-related case. During the probe, the agency gathered credible evidence establishing Wagay’s direct links with a terrorist handler from Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, who is believed to be operating from across the border.“On the behest of the terrorist handler, the OGW was orchestrating terrorist, unlawful and anti-national activities by actively engaging in terrorist conspiracy, propagating and furthering anti-India narratives,” the official added.Authorities believe Wagay played a key role in spreading extremist ideology and assisting the revival of terrorist networks in south Kashmir by maintaining discreet but coordinated communication with handlers outside the country.The SIA said further investigations are underway to uncover the broader network of operatives and sleeper cells associated with Hizb-ul-Mujahideen in the Union territory.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

NEW DELHI: All India Trinamool Congress on Sunday called the Joint Parliament Committee "a farce" and said it will not nominate anyone to the JPC, which is formed to look into the three bills that lay down the framework for the removal of the prime minister and chief ministers.Earlier, the House passed the proposal of Union and home minister Amit Shah to send the Government of Union Territories (Amendment) Bill 2025, the Constitution (One Hundred And Thirtieth Amendment) Bill 2025, and the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill 2025, to the JPC after it were introduced in Lok Sabha on Wednesday.Corruption, Lawlessness, Infiltration: PM Modi Attacks Mamata Govt In Bengal Rally | TMC | BJP"We oppose the 130th constitution amendment Bill at the stage of introduction, and in our view the JPC is a farce. Therefore, we are not nominating anyone from AITC," the Trinamool Congress said in a statement, PTI reported.The proposed legislations establish a legal framework for the removal of the Prime Minister, chief ministers, and ministers following their arrest for 30 consecutive days on serious charges. The introduction of the bills just before the conclusion of the Monsoon Session provoked strong opposition. In Lok Sabha, tensions escalated as copies of the bills were torn and thrown, with members from both ruling and opposition parties confronting each other when Union home minister Amit Shah proceeded to present the bills. TMC MPs charged towards Shah during the introduction of the three draft laws. Both Houses have passed a resolution to refer the bills to the JPC, which comprises 21 members from Lok Sabha and 10 from Rajya Sabha. The committee is tasked with submitting its report to the House during the Winter Session, anticipated to be held in the third week of November.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

'Don't make it a causality': Jaishankar on India-China relations; says ties not dependent on US

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar stated that India's relationship with China should be considered independently from its ties with the United States. He cautioned against assuming a direct causal link between Washington's and Beijing's relations with New Delhi.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar stated that India's relationship with China should be considered independently from its ties with the United States. He cautioned against assuming a direct causal link between Washington's and Beijing's relations with New Delhi.  NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said that India’s relationship with China should not be viewed through the prism of New Delhi's ties with the United States. Speaking at The Economic Times World Leaders Forum 2025, Jaishankar said, “What I want you to understand is it's not black and white. It's not that something has happened with America, so therefore, immediately, something has happened with China. There are different timelines of different lengths on different problems.” He added that it would be a “mistaken analysis” to assume events with Washington automatically dictated New Delhi’s stance with Beijing. “There is a flow of that relationship. There are other relationships, but don’t make this connection so tight, don’t make it a causality. That’s not the reality,” he said.The minister’s comments come against the backdrop of trade tensions with Washington after the Trump administration sharply raised tariffs on Indian goods, in response to New Delhi’s purchase of Russian oil. Jaishankar said India remained committed to protecting its farmers and small producers, calling the tariff hike “unjustified and unreasonable.” He argued the issue had been mischaracterised as an oil dispute, pointing out that larger importers such as China and European nations had not faced similar criticism. “The same arguments that have been used to target India have not been applied to the largest oil importer, which is China, and have not been applied to the largest LNG importer, which is the European nations,” he said.Jaishankar’s remarks came soon after his visit to Moscow, where he met President Vladimir Putin and senior Russian officials, and ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s scheduled trip to Japan and China later this month for the SCO summit.

‘Overlooking each other’s history’: Jaishankar takes swipe at US, Pakistan; reminds Bin Laden was found in Abbottabad

External affairs minister Dr S Jaishankar on Saturday criticised US–Pakistan for “overlooking each other's history,” recalling the Abbottabad raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He again rejected claims of US mediation in the post-Operation Sindoor ceasefire, stressing it was a direct India–Pakistan deal, and warned opposition against compromising farmers’ interests or India’s strategic autonomy.

External affairs minister Dr S Jaishankar on Saturday criticised US–Pakistan for “overlooking each other's history,” recalling the Abbottabad raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He again rejected claims of US mediation in the post-Operation Sindoor ceasefire, stressing it was a direct India–Pakistan deal, and warned opposition against compromising farmers’ interests or India’s strategic autonomy. Dr S Jaishankar (File photo) NEW DELHI: External affairs minister Dr S Jaishankar on Saturday took a sharp swipe at US and Pakistan, saying both countries had a habit of “overlooking history.”Speaking at Economic Times World Leaders Forum, the foreign minister cited the 2011 US raid in Abbottabad that killed Osama bin Laden. He reminded that it was the same Pakistan that had sheltered the 9/11 attacker."They have a history with each other, and they have a history of overlooking their history. It is the same military that went into Abbottabad (in Pakistan) and found who there?" Dr Jaishankar asked.He further underlined that India’s foreign policy was guided by long-term confidence rather than short-term “politics of convenience.” “When countries focus on the politics of convenience, they keep trying to do this or that. But I always keep in mind the larger structural strengths of the relationship, and the confidence that comes from it. At the end of the day, I know my strengths and I know the importance of my relationships,” he said.The EAM also reiterated that US didn't mediate between India and Pakistan for the ceasefire after the conflict following India's Operation Sindoor."Since 1970s, for more than 50 years now, there's a national consensus in this country that we do not accept mediation in our relations with Pakistan," he said.He further explained that calls from the US and other countries were made during Operation Sindoor, but clarified that these were routine diplomatic exchanges, not negotiations. “Every American phone call I had is there on my ‘X’ account,” he said, emphasising that the settlement was the result of direct talks between India and Pakistan, and pushing back against the narrative by opposition and US president Donald Trump that US negotiated the ceasefire.The external affairs minister also used the occasion to attack the opposition, saying that India was also resisting external pressures to protect its national economic interests.“When it comes to trade and the interests of farmers, when it comes to our strategic autonomy, when it comes to opposing mediation, this government is very clear. Our positions are firm,” he said, warning that, “If anybody disagrees with us, please tell the people of India that you are not prepared to defend the interests of farmers. Please tell the people of India that you don’t value strategic autonomy. We do. We will do whatever we have to do to maintain it.”About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

This critique follows PM Modi's inauguration of key infrastructure projects in Bihar and Kolkata, including a bridge, metro lines, and the Amrit Bharat Express. Mallikarjun Kharge (ANI) NEW DELHI: Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge on Saturday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi, targeting the government’s announced economic reforms and highlighting issues such as massive unemployment, falling wages, declining savings, and rising liabilities.“Your recent lofty speeches about 'reforming' the Economy are meaningless,” Kharge said through a post on X. “Pick up some REAL data and see how you messed up!”Kharge’s comments come a day after PM Modi, along with Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, inaugurated the Aunta–Simaria bridge over the Ganga, a key project linking Mokama in Patna district with Begusarai. He also inaugurated the Amrit Bharat Express connecting Gaya to Delhi, as well as a Buddhist Circuit train linking Vaishali in northern Bihar to Koderma in neighboring Jharkhand.During his visit to Kolkata, he inaugurated three new metro sections spanning 13.61 km and launched services on the Noapara–Jai Hind Bimanbandar, Sealdah–Esplanade, and Beleghata–Hemanta Mukhopadhyay routes.The Prime Minister said the projects demonstrate the government’s focus on developing every city as India progresses toward becoming the world’s third-largest economy. He added that they reflect the administration’s commitment to urban development and green mobility.Meanwhile, the Congress intensified its attack on the BJP-led central government, accusing it of engaging in "vote chori." Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, on Monday renewed his criticism of the Election Commission during his ongoing "Voter Adhikaar Yatra," accusing the poll body of manipulating votes and targeting him with its demand for an affidavit.

The moment, the feeling when he was showing me the tricolour, is beyond words. In my discussion with Group Captain Shubhanshu, I have seen the immense courage and infinite dreams of the youth of the new India. To take these dreams forward, we are also going to prepare India's astronaut pool. Today on Space Day, I invite my young friends to join this astronaut pool to give wings to India's dreams,” PM Modi said.We have reached Moon and Mars, and we have to take a peek in deep space, he added.PollWhich excites you more about India’s space journey?Achievements in space missionsOpportunities for youth and startupsThe Prime Minister also urged private players to strengthen their role in space research and innovation. “On August 15, I mentioned several sectors where India must become self-reliant. On Space Day today, I want to tell the country’s space startups that in the next five years, we can create five unicorns in the space sector. Currently, India carries out around 5–6 major launches annually from its soil. I want the private sector to step forward so that in the next five years, we are able to see 50 rocket launches in a year, that means one every week.”The Prime Minister underlined India’s growing position as a leader in the field, pointing to its recent achievements. “We have also become the fourth country in the world to have the capability of docking and undocking in space,” he said, stressing that “achieving new milestones one after another in the space sector has become the nature of India and Indian scientists.” He noted that just two years ago, India became the first nation to land on the South Pole of the Moon with Chandrayaan-3.He also highlighted India’s role in inspiring young minds, citing the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics, recently hosted in India with participants from more than 60 countries. “Indian youth also won medals. This Olympiad is a symbol of India's emerging leadership in the space sector. I am happy that ISRO has also taken initiatives like Indian Space Hackathon and Robotics Challenge to increase the interest of young friends towards space,” PM Modi said.The occasion marks the second National Space Day, established by PM Modi after the successful Chandrayaan-3 landing on August 23, 2023. The theme for 2025, “Aryabhatta to Gaganyaan: Ancient Wisdom to Infinite Possibilities,” reflects India’s journey from ancient astronomical traditions to the frontiers of human spaceflight.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Rijiju questioned Gandhi's credibility, accusing him of public lies and demanding an apology. Gandhi escalated his accusations against the BJP, alleging vote theft and accusing the Election Commission of complicity in undermining citizens' voting rights during a rally in Bhagalpur. Kiren Rijiju and Rahul Gandhi NEW DELHI: Union minister Kiren Rijiju reamed Rahul Gandhi out in a veiled dig over his "vote chori" charge, claiming the "credibility of the spoiled brat is hitting a new low!"Sharing a clip of CSDS psephologist Sanjay Kumar apologising for his Maharashtra data mishap, the Union parliamentary affairs minister said: At least, CSDS head has apologised! How can someone lie so publicly and do not tender apology? Credibility of the spoiled brat non-serious political leaders are hitting new low!"Sanjay Kumar, who is co-director at Lokniti-CSDS, apologised on Tuesday for his post on the Maharashtra elections, which claimed a significant dip in the number of voters in two assembly constituencies compared to the Lok Sabha election held just months earlier.However, CSDS's data set off a political storm, with the opposition, particularly the Congress-led INDIA bloc, alleging that vote theft had occurred in the elections.Escalating his "vote chori" campaign against the BJP, Rahul Gandhi on Friday mounted a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP-led NDA government, accusing them of attempting 'vote theft' in Bihar and betraying the country’s youth with policies that 'destroy employment opportunities.'"The entire country now knows that Narendra Modi steals votes," Gandhi alleged. Addressing a massive public rally in Bhagalpur during the ongoing ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’, Gandhi alleged that the Modi government and the Election Commission were working together to snatch away citizens’ constitutional right to vote. “The SIR is an attempt by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP and the EC to steal your votes. They are trying their best to snatch your voting rights. The ‘vote chor’ came to Gayaji, but he did not say even a word on his government's attempt to steal votes with the help of the EC,” Gandhi said. He alleged that though PM Modi visited Bihar earlier in the day, he remained silent on alleged irregularities in the Maharashtra and Karnataka elections as well as the crisis in Manipur. He attacked Modi for maintaining “silence” on irregularities in elections. “The SIR is an attempt by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP and the EC to steal your votes. They are trying their best to snatch your voting rights. The ‘vote chor’ came to Gayaji, but he did not say even a word on his government's attempt to steal votes with the help of the EC,” the Congress leader said. Invoking the Constitution, Gandhi said all citizens are equal and every person has one vote, but alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Election Commission are attacking it by canceling votes. He cited the case of a voter who told him his vote was canceled by the EC after he had voted for Congress in the Lok Sabha elections. "Constitution guarantees equal rights to everyone; but PM and EC are snatching people's right to vote," he alleged.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

SIR row: Amartya Sen raises concern over revision; claims it risks 'disenfranchising' poor people

Amartya Sen voiced concerns that Bihar's electoral roll revision could disenfranchise the poor due to strict documentation requirements. The Supreme Court questioned the lack of political party involvement in correcting voter deletions during the revision. The court allowed online claim submissions with Aadhaar or other documents, seeking status reports from political parties by September 8.

Amartya Sen voiced concerns that Bihar's electoral roll revision could disenfranchise the poor due to strict documentation requirements. The Supreme Court questioned the lack of political party involvement in correcting voter deletions during the revision. The court allowed online claim submissions with Aadhaar or other documents, seeking status reports from political parties by September 8. Amartya Sen NEW DELHI: Nobel laureate Amartya Sen raised concerns over the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in poll-bound Bihar, cautioning that without sensitivity, the exercise could “disenfranchise” large sections of the poor and marginalised. He questioned the fairness of a bureaucratic process that requires strict documentation from citizens who may not have easy access to such papers. Bihar SIR: SC Slams Political Parties’ Silence, Directs Poll Panel To Accept Aadhaar Or 11 DocumentsWhile acknowledging the need for administrative checks and periodic revisions, Sen stressed these must not come at the expense of fundamental rights."Yes, it's true that from time to time various procedural tasks need to be carried out. However, in doing so, one cannot create a 'better system' by trampling on the rights of the poor," Sen told news agency PTI.He emphasised the importance of a just and inclusive approach, pointing out that many individuals still lack proper documentation and, as a result, are often excluded from the electoral process."Many people don't have documents. Many cannot vote. If, in the name of trying to improve things a little, harm is caused to many, then that becomes a serious mistake," Sen said, adding, "You cannot justify seven new mistakes just to correct one".Meanwhile, the Supreme Court on Friday expressed surprise at the lack of political parties' involvement in correcting names of voters deleted during the SIR of the electoral rolls in Bihar. The top court also said that claim forms can be submitted along with Aadhaar card or any other 11 acceptable documents. "We will allow online submission of claims of deleted voters with Aadhaar card or any other acceptable documents for Bihar SIR," the bench said, as quoted by PTI. "All the political parties shall file the status report by the next date of hearing on the claim form they had facilitated in filing by excluded voters," the bench added. The matter has been posted for hearing on September 8. During the hearing, the Election Commission informed the court that while 85,000 new voters had been added in the ongoing revision, only two objections had been filed by booth-level agents of political parties. A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi was hearing a batch of petitions challenging the SIR exercise. The petitions were filed by RJD MP Manoj Jha, the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), PUCL, activist Yogendra Yadav, Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra and former Bihar MLA Mujahid Alam. The petitioners have sought to quash the ECI’s June 24 directive, which requires large numbers of voters in Bihar to submit proof of citizenship to stay on the rolls.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Many in US worried Trump is alienating allies, says Kerry



Many in US worried Trump is alienating allies, says KerryTNN /  Aug 23, 2025, 04:46 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLarge  NEW DELHI: Former US secretary of state John Kerry said concerns about President Donald Trump alienating allies with his policies are genuine and described as unfortunate the current struggle between Trump and PM Narendra Modi.On India-US ties, Kerry said that instead of genuine diplomatic efforts to find common ground, there was "a little bit too much ordering, pressuring and pushing people around to do one thing or another." The real way forward, he stressed, was through cooperation and respect. The relationship has been strained in recent weeks, with the Trump administration set to impose secondary sanctions on India for its oil trade with Russia."We are concerned. This struggle between President Trump and PM Modi is unfortunate. It seems to me it's a reflection that great nations don't necessarily exhibit greatness by giving people ultimatums all the time," Kerry said at the ET World Leaders Forum. He expressed hope India and the US would resolve their trade dispute, noting that India had offered to place almost 60% of goods at zero tariff. "That's a big shift. We need to get to a better place faster," he said.Kerry, who served under President Obama, appreciated Trump's peace efforts with Russian President Vladimir Putin but said Putin had no intention of ending the war. "He sees gains on the ground, disarray in the West, and Trump's wavering stance on staying power," he said, contrasting it with Biden's firm support for Ukraine.Calling Russia a "gas station with a lot of gas," Kerry said its long-run economic prospects were bleak. He added that both Russia's security concerns and Ukraine's guarantees needed serious discussion. On Gaza, Kerry said Israel's current govt does not believe in a two-state solution, which posed a "big problem for the world." He also praised India's ambitious renewable energy goals, saying nuclear power must be part of the transition.

J&K: Hizbul Mujahideen sleeper cell busted; OGW arrested, linked to cross-border terror handler

Jammu and Kashmir Police's SIA made a significant breakthrough by apprehending Altaf Hussain Wagay, an over-ground worker linked to Hizbul Mujahideen. Wagay, a resident of Shopian, was operating as a sleeper cell, facilitating terror activities in the region. Investigations revealed his direct links with a Hizb handler operating from across the border, orchestrating anti-national activities.

Jammu and Kashmir Police's SIA made a significant breakthrough by apprehending Altaf Hussain Wagay, an over-ground worker linked to Hizbul Mujahideen. Wagay, a resident of Shopian, was operating as a sleeper cell, facilitating terror activities in the region. Investigations revealed his direct links with a Hizb handler operating from across the border, orchestrating anti-national activities.  NEW DELHI: In a significant breakthrough, the state investigation agency (SIA) of Jammu and Kashmir Police on Saturday apprehended an over-ground worker (OGW) linked to the proscribed terrorist outfit Hizbul Mujahideen (Hizb).The arrested individual, identified as Altaf Hussain Wagay, hails from the Reban Gund area of Behram, Shopian. According to an SIA spokesperson, Wagay had been operating as a sleeper cell for Hizb and was involved in facilitating terror-related activities in the region.“Following relentless efforts, SIA Kashmir has achieved a major success by apprehending an OGW, Altaf Hussain Wagay, resident of Reban Gund area of Behram in Shopian,” the spokesperson said in a statement.The arrest was made in connection with an ongoing investigation into a terrorism-related case. During the probe, the agency gathered credible evidence establishing Wagay’s direct links with a terrorist handler from Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, who is believed to be operating from across the border.“On the behest of the terrorist handler, the OGW was orchestrating terrorist, unlawful and anti-national activities by actively engaging in terrorist conspiracy, propagating and furthering anti-India narratives,” the official added.Authorities believe Wagay played a key role in spreading extremist ideology and assisting the revival of terrorist networks in south Kashmir by maintaining discreet but coordinated communication with handlers outside the country.The SIA said further investigations are underway to uncover the broader network of operatives and sleeper cells associated with Hizb-ul-Mujahideen in the Union territory.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The party opposes the constitutional amendment bill. Tensions rose in Lok Sabha during the bill's introduction.  NEW DELHI: All India Trinamool Congress on Sunday called the Joint Parliament Committee "a farce" and said it will not nominate anyone to the JPC, which is formed to look into the three bills that lay down the framework for the removal of the prime minister and chief ministers.Earlier, the House passed the proposal of Union and home minister Amit Shah to send the Government of Union Territories (Amendment) Bill 2025, the Constitution (One Hundred And Thirtieth Amendment) Bill 2025, and the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill 2025, to the JPC after it were introduced in Lok Sabha on Wednesday.Corruption, Lawlessness, Infiltration: PM Modi Attacks Mamata Govt In Bengal Rally | TMC | BJP"We oppose the 130th constitution amendment Bill at the stage of introduction, and in our view the JPC is a farce. Therefore, we are not nominating anyone from AITC," the Trinamool Congress said in a statement, PTI reported.The proposed legislations establish a legal framework for the removal of the Prime Minister, chief ministers, and ministers following their arrest for 30 consecutive days on serious charges. The introduction of the bills just before the conclusion of the Monsoon Session provoked strong opposition. In Lok Sabha, tensions escalated as copies of the bills were torn and thrown, with members from both ruling and opposition parties confronting each other when Union home minister Amit Shah proceeded to present the bills. TMC MPs charged towards Shah during the introduction of the three draft laws. Both Houses have passed a resolution to refer the bills to the JPC, which comprises 21 members from Lok Sabha and 10 from Rajya Sabha. The committee is tasked with submitting its report to the House during the Winter Session, anticipated to be held in the third week of November.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

'Don't make it a causality': Jaishankar on India-China relations; says ties not dependent on US

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar stated that India's relationship with China should be considered independently from its ties with the United States. He cautioned against assuming a direct causal link between Washington's and Beijing's relations with New Delhi.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar stated that India's relationship with China should be considered independently from its ties with the United States. He cautioned against assuming a direct causal link between Washington's and Beijing's relations with New Delhi.  NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said that India’s relationship with China should not be viewed through the prism of New Delhi's ties with the United States. Speaking at The Economic Times World Leaders Forum 2025, Jaishankar said, “What I want you to understand is it's not black and white. It's not that something has happened with America, so therefore, immediately, something has happened with China. There are different timelines of different lengths on different problems.” He added that it would be a “mistaken analysis” to assume events with Washington automatically dictated New Delhi’s stance with Beijing. “There is a flow of that relationship. There are other relationships, but don’t make this connection so tight, don’t make it a causality. That’s not the reality,” he said.The minister’s comments come against the backdrop of trade tensions with Washington after the Trump administration sharply raised tariffs on Indian goods, in response to New Delhi’s purchase of Russian oil. Jaishankar said India remained committed to protecting its farmers and small producers, calling the tariff hike “unjustified and unreasonable.” He argued the issue had been mischaracterised as an oil dispute, pointing out that larger importers such as China and European nations had not faced similar criticism. “The same arguments that have been used to target India have not been applied to the largest oil importer, which is China, and have not been applied to the largest LNG importer, which is the European nations,” he said.Jaishankar’s remarks came soon after his visit to Moscow, where he met President Vladimir Putin and senior Russian officials, and ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s scheduled trip to Japan and China later this month for the SCO summit.

‘Overlooking each other’s history’: Jaishankar takes swipe at US, Pakistan; reminds Bin Laden was found in Abbottabad

External affairs minister Dr S Jaishankar on Saturday criticised US–Pakistan for “overlooking each other's history,” recalling the Abbottabad raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He again rejected claims of US mediation in the post-Operation Sindoor ceasefire, stressing it was a direct India–Pakistan deal, and warned opposition against compromising farmers’ interests or India’s strategic autonomy.

External affairs minister Dr S Jaishankar on Saturday criticised US–Pakistan for “overlooking each other's history,” recalling the Abbottabad raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He again rejected claims of US mediation in the post-Operation Sindoor ceasefire, stressing it was a direct India–Pakistan deal, and warned opposition against compromising farmers’ interests or India’s strategic autonomy. Dr S Jaishankar (File photo) NEW DELHI: External affairs minister Dr S Jaishankar on Saturday took a sharp swipe at US and Pakistan, saying both countries had a habit of “overlooking history.”Speaking at Economic Times World Leaders Forum, the foreign minister cited the 2011 US raid in Abbottabad that killed Osama bin Laden. He reminded that it was the same Pakistan that had sheltered the 9/11 attacker."They have a history with each other, and they have a history of overlooking their history. It is the same military that went into Abbottabad (in Pakistan) and found who there?" Dr Jaishankar asked.He further underlined that India’s foreign policy was guided by long-term confidence rather than short-term “politics of convenience.” “When countries focus on the politics of convenience, they keep trying to do this or that. But I always keep in mind the larger structural strengths of the relationship, and the confidence that comes from it. At the end of the day, I know my strengths and I know the importance of my relationships,” he said.The EAM also reiterated that US didn't mediate between India and Pakistan for the ceasefire after the conflict following India's Operation Sindoor."Since 1970s, for more than 50 years now, there's a national consensus in this country that we do not accept mediation in our relations with Pakistan," he said.He further explained that calls from the US and other countries were made during Operation Sindoor, but clarified that these were routine diplomatic exchanges, not negotiations. “Every American phone call I had is there on my ‘X’ account,” he said, emphasising that the settlement was the result of direct talks between India and Pakistan, and pushing back against the narrative by opposition and US president Donald Trump that US negotiated the ceasefire.The external affairs minister also used the occasion to attack the opposition, saying that India was also resisting external pressures to protect its national economic interests.“When it comes to trade and the interests of farmers, when it comes to our strategic autonomy, when it comes to opposing mediation, this government is very clear. Our positions are firm,” he said, warning that, “If anybody disagrees with us, please tell the people of India that you are not prepared to defend the interests of farmers. Please tell the people of India that you don’t value strategic autonomy. We do. We will do whatever we have to do to maintain it.”About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

This critique follows PM Modi's inauguration of key infrastructure projects in Bihar and Kolkata, including a bridge, metro lines, and the Amrit Bharat Express. Mallikarjun Kharge (ANI) NEW DELHI: Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge on Saturday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi, targeting the government’s announced economic reforms and highlighting issues such as massive unemployment, falling wages, declining savings, and rising liabilities.“Your recent lofty speeches about 'reforming' the Economy are meaningless,” Kharge said through a post on X. “Pick up some REAL data and see how you messed up!”Kharge’s comments come a day after PM Modi, along with Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, inaugurated the Aunta–Simaria bridge over the Ganga, a key project linking Mokama in Patna district with Begusarai. He also inaugurated the Amrit Bharat Express connecting Gaya to Delhi, as well as a Buddhist Circuit train linking Vaishali in northern Bihar to Koderma in neighboring Jharkhand.During his visit to Kolkata, he inaugurated three new metro sections spanning 13.61 km and launched services on the Noapara–Jai Hind Bimanbandar, Sealdah–Esplanade, and Beleghata–Hemanta Mukhopadhyay routes.The Prime Minister said the projects demonstrate the government’s focus on developing every city as India progresses toward becoming the world’s third-largest economy. He added that they reflect the administration’s commitment to urban development and green mobility.Meanwhile, the Congress intensified its attack on the BJP-led central government, accusing it of engaging in "vote chori." Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, on Monday renewed his criticism of the Election Commission during his ongoing "Voter Adhikaar Yatra," accusing the poll body of manipulating votes and targeting him with its demand for an affidavit. The opposition leader reiterated his ‘vote chori’ allegations against the ruling party, stating at a rally in Bihar on Thursday, “BJP trying to steal people’s votes to benefit a section of industrialists," adding that ‘vote chori’ constitutes an “attack on the Constitution of India.”About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The moment, the feeling when he was showing me the tricolour, is beyond words. In my discussion with Group Captain Shubhanshu, I have seen the immense courage and infinite dreams of the youth of the new India.

Gandhi escalated his accusations against the BJP, alleging vote theft and accusing the Election Commission of complicity in undermining citizens' voting rights during a rally in Bhagalpur. Kiren Rijiju and Rahul Gandhi NEW DELHI: Union minister Kiren Rijiju reamed Rahul Gandhi out in a veiled dig over his "vote chori" charge, claiming the "credibility of the spoiled brat is hitting a new low!"Sharing a clip of CSDS psephologist Sanjay Kumar apologising for his Maharashtra data mishap, the Union parliamentary affairs minister said: At least, CSDS head has apologised! How can someone lie so publicly and do not tender apology? Credibility of the spoiled brat non-serious political leaders are hitting new low!"Sanjay Kumar, who is co-director at Lokniti-CSDS, apologised on Tuesday for his post on the Maharashtra elections, which claimed a significant dip in the number of voters in two assembly constituencies compared to the Lok Sabha election held just months earlier.However, CSDS's data set off a political storm, with the opposition, particularly the Congress-led INDIA bloc, alleging that vote theft had occurred in the elections.Escalating his "vote chori" campaign against the BJP, Rahul Gandhi on Friday mounted a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP-led NDA government, accusing them of attempting 'vote theft' in Bihar and betraying the country’s youth with policies that 'destroy employment opportunities.'"The entire country now knows that Narendra Modi steals votes," Gandhi alleged. Addressing a massive public rally in Bhagalpur during the ongoing ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’, Gandhi alleged that the Modi government and the Election Commission were working together to snatch away citizens’ constitutional right to vote. “The SIR is an attempt by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP and the EC to steal your votes. They are trying their best to snatch your voting rights. The ‘vote chor’ came to Gayaji, but he did not say even a word on his government's attempt to steal votes with the help of the EC,” Gandhi said. He alleged that though PM Modi visited Bihar earlier in the day, he remained silent on alleged irregularities in the Maharashtra and Karnataka elections as well as the crisis in Manipur. He attacked Modi for maintaining “silence” on irregularities in elections. “The SIR is an attempt by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP and the EC to steal your votes. They are trying their best to snatch your voting rights. The ‘vote chor’ came to Gayaji, but he did not say even a word on his government's attempt to steal votes with the help of the EC,” the Congress leader said. Invoking the Constitution, Gandhi said all citizens are equal and every person has one vote, but alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Election Commission are attacking it by canceling votes. He cited the case of a voter who told him his vote was canceled by the EC after he had voted for Congress in the Lok Sabha elections. "Constitution guarantees equal rights to everyone; but PM and EC are snatching people's right to vote," he alleged.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The court allowed online claim submissions with Aadhaar or other documents, seeking status reports from political parties by September 8. Amartya Sen NEW DELHI: Nobel laureate Amartya Sen raised concerns over the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in poll-bound Bihar, cautioning that without sensitivity, the exercise could “disenfranchise” large sections of the poor and marginalised. He questioned the fairness of a bureaucratic process that requires strict documentation from citizens who may not have easy access to such papers. Bihar SIR: SC Slams Political Parties’ Silence, Directs Poll Panel To Accept Aadhaar Or 11 DocumentsWhile acknowledging the need for administrative checks and periodic revisions, Sen stressed these must not come at the expense of fundamental rights."Yes, it's true that from time to time various procedural tasks need to be carried out. However, in doing so, one cannot create a 'better system' by trampling on the rights of the poor," Sen told news agency PTI.He emphasised the importance of a just and inclusive approach, pointing out that many individuals still lack proper documentation and, as a result, are often excluded from the electoral process."Many people don't have documents. Many cannot vote. If, in the name of trying to improve things a little, harm is caused to many, then that becomes a serious mistake," Sen said, adding, "You cannot justify seven new mistakes just to correct one".Meanwhile, the Supreme Court on Friday expressed surprise at the lack of political parties' involvement in correcting names of voters deleted during the SIR of the electoral rolls in Bihar. The top court also said that claim forms can be submitted along with Aadhaar card or any other 11 acceptable documents. "We will allow online submission of claims of deleted voters with Aadhaar card or any other acceptable documents for Bihar SIR," the bench said, as quoted by PTI. "All the political parties shall file the status report by the next date of hearing on the claim form they had facilitated in filing by excluded voters," the bench added. The matter has been posted for hearing on September 8. During the hearing, the Election Commission informed the court that while 85,000 new voters had been added in the ongoing revision, only two objections had been filed by booth-level agents of political parties. A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi was hearing a batch of petitions challenging the SIR exercise. The petitions were filed by RJD MP Manoj Jha, the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), PUCL, activist Yogendra Yadav, Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra and former Bihar MLA Mujahid Alam. The petitioners have sought to quash the ECI’s June 24 directive, which requires large numbers of voters in Bihar to submit proof of citizenship to stay on the rolls.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Many in US worried Trump is alienating allies, says Kerry



Many in US worried Trump is alienating allies, says KerryTNN /  Aug 23, 2025, 04:46 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLarge  NEW DELHI: Former US secretary of state John Kerry said concerns about President Donald Trump alienating allies with his policies are genuine and described as unfortunate the current struggle between Trump and PM Narendra Modi.On India-US ties, Kerry said that instead of genuine diplomatic efforts to find common ground, there was "a little bit too much ordering, pressuring and pushing people around to do one thing or another." The real way forward, he stressed, was through cooperation and respect. The relationship has been strained in recent weeks, with the Trump administration set to impose secondary sanctions on India for its oil trade with Russia."We are concerned. This struggle between President Trump and PM Modi is unfortunate. It seems to me it's a reflection that great nations don't necessarily exhibit greatness by giving people ultimatums all the time," Kerry said at the ET World Leaders Forum. He expressed hope India and the US would resolve their trade dispute, noting that India had offered to place almost 60% of goods at zero tariff. "That's a big shift. We need to get to a better place faster," he said.Kerry, who served under President Obama, appreciated Trump's peace efforts with Russian President Vladimir Putin but said Putin had no intention of ending the war. "He sees gains on the ground, disarray in the West, and Trump's wavering stance on staying power," he said, contrasting it with Biden's firm support for Ukraine.Calling Russia a "gas station with a lot of gas," Kerry said its long-run economic prospects were bleak. He added that both Russia's security concerns and Ukraine's guarantees needed serious discussion. On Gaza, Kerry said Israel's current govt does not believe in a two-state solution, which posed a "big problem for the world." He also praised India's ambitious renewable energy goals, saying nuclear power must be part of the transition.
