Teen Innovator Soars to New Heights: Mehar Singh Breaks Guinness World Record with Lightning-Fast Drone AscentMediawire /  Aug 28, 2024, 16:35 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLargeAt just 17 years old, Mehar Singh has soared into the spotlight by shattering the Guinness World Record for the fastest 100-meter ascent by a quadcopter. Mehar’s custom-engineered drone reached this remarkable milestone in an astonishing 0.91 seconds, a feat that not only demonstrates his technical prowess but also sets a new benchmark in the rapidly evolving world of drone technology.Mehar’s journey to this achievement has been anything but straightforward. His fascination with drones began in 8th grade, and this passion has only deepened over the years. With a keen interest in pushing technological boundaries, Mehar embarked on a months-long project to build a drone capable of unparalleled vertical acceleration.“I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of pushing the limits of what drones can do,” Mehar explained. “But breaking a world record wasn’t just about the end result; it was about the process. I wanted to prove that current technology could achieve something extraordinary, but the path to get there was filled with challenges.”The project required Mehar to design, test, and refine multiple drone prototypes. “There were moments when I felt like I was chasing an impossible dream,” Mehar recalled. “I went through countless designs, and many of them failed during testing. Some drones crashed so badly that I had no choice but to go back to the drawing board and start from scratch. Each crash was a setback, but it also sparked new ideas and innovations.”Undeterred by the setbacks, Mehar poured his energy into creating a drone that was not only fast but also aerodynamically optimized. “I spent countless hours on CAD software, meticulously designing and tweaking each component. The goal was to make the drone as streamlined as possible, which led me to shape it like a rocket. This design wasn’t just about aesthetics; it was about reducing drag and maximizing speed.”Mehar’s dedication to his craft paid off in spectacular fashion. “Every failure taught me something valuable,” he said. “It forced me to think creatively and to consider every detail, from the materials used to the weight distribution of the drone. The process was grueling, but it was also incredibly rewarding to see my ideas take flight—literally.”This record-breaking achievement is more than just a personal triumph for Mehar; it has significant implications for the future of drone technology. “The possibilities are endless,” Mehar mused. “High-speed vertical acceleration could revolutionize everything from emergency response to space exploration. This isn’t just about setting a record; it’s about opening doors to new innovations and applications.”Mehar’s groundbreaking work has already begun to inspire others in the drone community and beyond. “I hope this accomplishment encourages other young innovators to push their own boundaries,” he said. “Technology is advancing rapidly, and there’s so much potential waiting to be unlocked. I’m excited to see where we can go from here.”As Mehar looks ahead, the sky is truly the limit. With his record-breaking drone, he has not only made history but also set the stage for future breakthroughs in drone technology. And for this young innovator, this is just the beginning of an exciting journey into the future of flight.Disclaimer: Content produced by Mediawire on Behalf of Shweta Singh

Doordarshan said that the morning aarti offered to Ram Lalla will be telecast live on DD National every morning from 6:30 am.The national broadcaster said that the decision to telecast the morning aarti live every day was taken with the aim of connecting devotees of Lord Ram, especially after the temple was inaugurated less than two months ago in a grand ceremony and everyone can't visit the temple in person. The Aarti will be telecast simultaneously on DD’s YouTube channel also.Secondly, the decision was taken because the Trust doesn’t have logistical arrangements as of now for a live broadcast. Therefore, DD will be posting a two-three-member crew on the temple premises for the coverage of the daily ritual.DD's announcement to telecast the Aarti live for 30 minutes every morning comes after getting the go-ahead from the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust for the same.

Microsoft plans to take on iPhone and Android smartphones with this new device

Microsoft discontinues Surface Duo smartphones but files a patent for a new foldable device with a single hinge system called 'spine cover plate'. The design aims to eliminate the hinge crease and reduce the device's thickness while offering added benefits and durability. However, its practicality remains uncertain.

Microsoft discontinues Surface Duo smartphones but files a patent for a new foldable device with a single hinge system called 'spine cover plate'. The design aims to eliminate the hinge crease and reduce the device's thickness while offering added benefits and durability. However, its practicality remains uncertain. Microsoft did not get the success it was anticipating with its Android-powered Surface Duo-series smartphones. The company has discontinued the lineup after the Duo 2. But, this does not mean the company has stopped trying. A new patent application filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29, reveals that the company is working on another foldable or dual-display mobile device.The patent application describes the company’s take on the foldable smartphone concept with single hinge technology called “spine cover plate”.Next Microsoft smartphones could feature a Galaxy Z Fold-like designAccording to the patent application, the phone could feature a “flexible display” in a bookstyle design similar to Galaxy Z Fold decies. However, the entire focus is on the spine cover plate mechanism which is aimed at protecting the single-hinge system of the device by covering the structural element. The differentiating factor between the regular hinge and Microsoft’s design is that the spine cover adjusts automatically during the opening and closing of the phone to prevent any unnecessary gaps around the hinge to protect it from dust as well as water. Currently, Samsung’s design offers an IPX8 rating which makes their foldables water-resistant only.The patent further mentions that the new hinge mechanism could allow Microsoft to eliminate the hinge crease less visible than the current options available in the market. Moreover, Microsoft has also mentioned techniques that could allow them to reduce the overall thickness of the foldable smartphone by allowing the spine cover plate to move closer to the device’s hinge when folded. “By retracting the spine cover plate toward the central spine as the first display-supporting frame and the second display-supporting frame are rotated into a face-to-face orientation, the width of the folded computing device is reduced, thereby enabling easier and more comfortable handling of the device, such as with one hand,” Microsoft noted in the patent.Interesting idea, but practicality is a question markThe entire smartphone market is searching for a way to eliminate the foldable crease from their smartphones. Some brands have already implemented the water-drop folding mechanism to reduce it, but there’s nothing like a crease-free foldable out there. Apart from that, the durability quotient of foldable is also important considering all the movable parts these phones have. That said, adding another layer or a movable part on top of the entire foldable mechanism does not appear like a wise move despite the added benefits and durability Microsoft has explained in the patent application.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Elon Musk’s AI company will make Grok chatbot more accessible, here’s how

Elon Musk criticizes OpenAI's deviation from mission and advocates AI accessibility for all. Musk announces xAI open sourcing Grok chatbot. OpenAI CEO Altman takes a dig at Musk's chatbot. Musk, obviously didn't like the jab and replied with a long-ish message saying “GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.”

Elon Musk criticizes OpenAI's deviation from mission and advocates AI accessibility for all. Musk announces xAI open sourcing Grok chatbot. OpenAI CEO Altman takes a dig at Musk's chatbot. Musk, obviously didn't like the jab and replied with a long-ish message saying “GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.”  Elon Musk has been extremely critical of ChatGPT maker OpenAI for deviating from its mission to develop AI for the benefit of humanity and taking a profit-making path. He has advocated that artificial intelligence (AI) should be accessible for all, and he has now announced that his AI startup xAI will open source Grok chatbot this week.“This week, @xAI will open source Grok,” Musk said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).In simpler words, open-sourcing a software, like a chatbot, means that the software projects are redistributable as all source code is accessible by everyone. One of the advantages of having open source software is that it provides flexibility to an enterprise to have multiple ways of fixing a problem rather than waiting for an internal team to provide a solution.“OpenAI is a lie”Meanwhile, a user suggested that OpenAI should do the same.“OpenAI should do the same if they are ‘open’ that is,” the user said. Musk replied, “OpenAI is a lie.”Musk wants AI technology to be open-source Musk had floated the idea of open-sourcing AI during a podcast in November last year. In a podcast with Lex Fridman, Musk suggested that he likes the idea of open-source AI. “I am generally in favour of open sourcing, like biassed towards open sourcing,” he said.His comments came soon after his AI company called xAI released Grok, its chatbot, which reportedly took four months to build. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was quick to take a dig at this and shared a post in which he built Grok with a single prompt on GPT Builder."GPTs can save a lot of effort:” he said.Musk, obviously didn't like the jab and replied with a long-ish message saying “GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.” About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Former Activision boss reportedly wants to buy TikTok

Bobby Kotick, former head of Activision Blizzard, may buy TikTok amid its potential US ban. A bill to sell TikTok is introduced, backed by President Biden. Kotick discussed acquisition with OpenAI head. Activision Blizzard faced a lawsuit. Concerns about data privacy and ties to China persist. TikTok urges American users to support it.

Bobby Kotick, former head of Activision Blizzard, may buy TikTok amid its potential US ban. A bill to sell TikTok is introduced, backed by President Biden. Kotick discussed acquisition with OpenAI head. Activision Blizzard faced a lawsuit. Concerns about data privacy and ties to China persist. TikTok urges American users to support it.  Bobby Kotick, the former head of Activision Blizzard, is reportedly considering buying TikTok, as the app could be banned in the United States. The Wall Street Journal reports that Kotick has talked to ByteDance, the company that owns TikTok, about buying the app, which could cost hundreds of billions of dollars.This comes as US lawmakers introduce a new bill that would make ByteDance sell TikTok within six months or stop it from being available in US app stores.President Joe Biden has said he would approve the bill if it passes in Congress.The Wall Street Journal report adds that Kotick, the head of OpenAI, Sam Altman, discussed teaming up to buy TikTok at a dinner last week. Kotick's interest in TikTok follows a rough end to his 30 years leading Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft acquired last year. The company faced a lawsuit saying it allowed sexual harassment and discrimination under Kotick's leadership. The Wall Street Journal also said Kotick knew about bad behaviour and didn't tell the board everything. Kotick was accused of harassment, but Activision Blizzard said the report was "misleading."Lawmakers are worried about data privacy and TikTok's ties to China. US President Biden, whose administration has banned the app already on state devices, has expressed his support for banning the app in the US. However, former President Donald Trump, who once wanted to ban TikTok, has changed his mind, saying a ban would help TikTok's rivals, like Facebook and YouTube. As the bill against TikTok gains support, the app has asked its American users to speak up for it, sending messages telling users to call their representatives. The bill, which passed a committee last week, is expected to be approved when the House votes on Wednesday. If it passes, it will then go to the Senate, and then the bill will be signed by the President of the US.Former Activision boss reportedly wants to buy TikTokAbout the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Why Earth Sciences minister Rijiju is upset with this European IT company



Why Earth Sciences minister Rijiju is upset with this European IT companyTOI Tech Desk / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Updated: Mar 11, 2024, 14:39 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLargeFollow us  PTI photo Earth Sciences Minister Kiren Rijiju is reportedly upset with the French IT company Atos. Reason is said to be delay in the delivery of two supercomputers by the French company to Indian weather forecasting institutes. According to a report in news agency PTI, the Earth Sciences Ministry had ordered two supercomputers worth $100 million from French firm Eviden, of the Atos Group, last year to enhance the computing capabilities of its institutions -- the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM)."I am more upset because the target we set was December. The Union Cabinet had already approved purchasing the supercomputer. We have only four petaflop capacity. We want to install up to 18 petaflop capacity," Rijiju told PTI in a video interview.He said that the French company ran into some financial trouble and wanted the government to make payment to its subsidiary.Minister says that the delay is causing him "worry"Rijiju said that the delay has caused him lots of worry as the company has overshot the timeline. "But I think we will sort it out soon," he said, adding that the government wanted to be "very correct in our position legally"."We are ready to release the money because we want the machine immediately. The only problem is the amount is not small. So if we pay now, if the company is bankrupt or something happens, who will bail out," the minister said.Rijiju further added that the government was taking some steps to speed up the delivery of the supercomputer but did not elaborate. "But I hope the French government will also intervene because we have a good understanding and a very good relationship with the French government."Since it is a high-cost equipment, we want to ensure that the transaction happens duly and properly," he said."From outside, everything's ready. It is only the problem with the main company. They want us to pay their subsidiary. We will pay only to a company whom we have entered an MoU with," Rijiju said.The supercomputing system, based on Eviden's BullSequana XH2000, is said to have a combined power capacity of up to 21.3 petaflops.Supercomputer at IITMThe supercomputer at the Pune-based IITM will provide 13 petaflops of computing power for atmosphere and climate research. As per the PTI report, it will integrate 3,000 CPU nodes using AMD EPYC 7643 processors and 26 GPU nodes through NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. The system will benefit from the NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand networking platform with In-Network Computing, 3PB all flash and 29PB disk-based DDN EXAScaler ES400NVX2 storage and Micron high-technology memory.The existing computing facility at NCMRWF is 2.8 petaflops and at IITM is 4 petaflops, respectively.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Teen Innovator Soars to New Heights: Mehar Singh Breaks Guinness World Record with Lightning-Fast Drone Ascent



Teen Innovator Soars to New Heights: Mehar Singh Breaks Guinness World Record with Lightning-Fast Drone AscentMediawire /  Aug 28, 2024, 16:35 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLargeAt just 17 years old, Mehar Singh has soared into the spotlight by shattering the Guinness World Record for the fastest 100-meter ascent by a quadcopter. Mehar’s custom-engineered drone reached this remarkable milestone in an astonishing 0.91 seconds, a feat that not only demonstrates his technical prowess but also sets a new benchmark in the rapidly evolving world of drone technology.Mehar’s journey to this achievement has been anything but straightforward. His fascination with drones began in 8th grade, and this passion has only deepened over the years. With a keen interest in pushing technological boundaries, Mehar embarked on a months-long project to build a drone capable of unparalleled vertical acceleration.“I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of pushing the limits of what drones can do,” Mehar explained. “But breaking a world record wasn’t just about the end result; it was about the process. I wanted to prove that current technology could achieve something extraordinary, but the path to get there was filled with challenges.”The project required Mehar to design, test, and refine multiple drone prototypes. “There were moments when I felt like I was chasing an impossible dream,” Mehar recalled. “I went through countless designs, and many of them failed during testing. Some drones crashed so badly that I had no choice but to go back to the drawing board and start from scratch. Each crash was a setback, but it also sparked new ideas and innovations.”Undeterred by the setbacks, Mehar poured his energy into creating a drone that was not only fast but also aerodynamically optimized. “I spent countless hours on CAD software, meticulously designing and tweaking each component. The goal was to make the drone as streamlined as possible, which led me to shape it like a rocket. This design wasn’t just about aesthetics; it was about reducing drag and maximizing speed.”Mehar’s dedication to his craft paid off in spectacular fashion. “Every failure taught me something valuable,” he said. “It forced me to think creatively and to consider every detail, from the materials used to the weight distribution of the drone. The process was grueling, but it was also incredibly rewarding to see my ideas take flight—literally.”This record-breaking achievement is more than just a personal triumph for Mehar; it has significant implications for the future of drone technology. “The possibilities are endless,” Mehar mused. “High-speed vertical acceleration could revolutionize everything from emergency response to space exploration. This isn’t just about setting a record; it’s about opening doors to new innovations and applications.”Mehar’s groundbreaking work has already begun to inspire others in the drone community and beyond. “I hope this accomplishment encourages other young innovators to push their own boundaries,” he said. “Technology is advancing rapidly, and there’s so much potential waiting to be unlocked. I’m excited to see where we can go from here.”As Mehar looks ahead, the sky is truly the limit. With his record-breaking drone, he has not only made history but also set the stage for future breakthroughs in drone technology. And for this young innovator, this is just the beginning of an exciting journey into the future of flight.Disclaimer: Content produced by Mediawire on Behalf of Shweta Singh

Doordarshan said that the morning aarti offered to Ram Lalla will be telecast live on DD National every morning from 6:30 am.The national broadcaster said that the decision to telecast the morning aarti live every day was taken with the aim of connecting devotees of Lord Ram, especially after the temple was inaugurated less than two months ago in a grand ceremony and everyone can't visit the temple in person. The Aarti will be telecast simultaneously on DD’s YouTube channel also.Secondly, the decision was taken because the Trust doesn’t have logistical arrangements as of now for a live broadcast. Therefore, DD will be posting a two-three-member crew on the temple premises for the coverage of the daily ritual.DD's announcement to telecast the Aarti live for 30 minutes every morning comes after getting the go-ahead from the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust for the same. Initially, DD will air the “Mangala aarti” for a few months, and then, the Ram Temple Trust will take a call on how to take it forward.6 Aartis daily at the Ayodhya Ram templeThere are 6 aartis of Ram Lalla held daily in Ayodhya Ram temple. These include Mangala Aarti at 4:30 am, Shringaar Aarti at 6:30 am, Rajbhog Aarti at 12 noon, Utthapan Aarti at 2 pm, Sandhya Aarti at 7 pm, and Shayan Aarti at 10 pm.Giving directions to devotees for Aarti, the temple trust said, "Entry for Mangala Aarti at 4 AM, Shringar Aarti at 6:15 AM, and Shayan Aarti at 10 PM is possible only with an entry pass. No entry passes required for other Aartis."Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust advisory to devoteesIn an advisory to devotees coming for darshan at the temple, the Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra said, "Devotees can enter the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir for Darshan from 6:30 AM to 9:30 PM. The entire process from entry to exit after Darshan at the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir is extremely simple and convenient. Typically, devotees can have a smooth Darshan of Prabhu Shri Ram Lalla Sarkar within 60 to 75 minutes."The temple trust advised devotees to leave their mobile phones, footwear, purses and other personal items outside the Mandir premises for their convenience and to save time.It has also asked devotees not to bring flowers, garlands, Prasad to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Microsoft plans to take on iPhone and Android smartphones with this new device

Microsoft discontinues Surface Duo smartphones but files a patent for a new foldable device with a single hinge system called 'spine cover plate'. The design aims to eliminate the hinge crease and reduce the device's thickness while offering added benefits and durability. However, its practicality remains uncertain.

Microsoft discontinues Surface Duo smartphones but files a patent for a new foldable device with a single hinge system called 'spine cover plate'. The design aims to eliminate the hinge crease and reduce the device's thickness while offering added benefits and durability. However, its practicality remains uncertain. Microsoft did not get the success it was anticipating with its Android-powered Surface Duo-series smartphones. The company has discontinued the lineup after the Duo 2. But, this does not mean the company has stopped trying. A new patent application filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29, reveals that the company is working on another foldable or dual-display mobile device.The patent application describes the company’s take on the foldable smartphone concept with single hinge technology called “spine cover plate”.Next Microsoft smartphones could feature a Galaxy Z Fold-like designAccording to the patent application, the phone could feature a “flexible display” in a bookstyle design similar to Galaxy Z Fold decies. However, the entire focus is on the spine cover plate mechanism which is aimed at protecting the single-hinge system of the device by covering the structural element. The differentiating factor between the regular hinge and Microsoft’s design is that the spine cover adjusts automatically during the opening and closing of the phone to prevent any unnecessary gaps around the hinge to protect it from dust as well as water. Currently, Samsung’s design offers an IPX8 rating which makes their foldables water-resistant only.The patent further mentions that the new hinge mechanism could allow Microsoft to eliminate the hinge crease less visible than the current options available in the market. Moreover, Microsoft has also mentioned techniques that could allow them to reduce the overall thickness of the foldable smartphone by allowing the spine cover plate to move closer to the device’s hinge when folded. “By retracting the spine cover plate toward the central spine as the first display-supporting frame and the second display-supporting frame are rotated into a face-to-face orientation, the width of the folded computing device is reduced, thereby enabling easier and more comfortable handling of the device, such as with one hand,” Microsoft noted in the patent.Interesting idea, but practicality is a question markThe entire smartphone market is searching for a way to eliminate the foldable crease from their smartphones. Some brands have already implemented the water-drop folding mechanism to reduce it, but there’s nothing like a crease-free foldable out there. Apart from that, the durability quotient of foldable is also important considering all the movable parts these phones have. That said, adding another layer or a movable part on top of the entire foldable mechanism does not appear like a wise move despite the added benefits and durability Microsoft has explained in the patent application.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Elon Musk’s AI company will make Grok chatbot more accessible, here’s how

Elon Musk criticizes OpenAI's deviation from mission and advocates AI accessibility for all. Musk announces xAI open sourcing Grok chatbot. OpenAI CEO Altman takes a dig at Musk's chatbot. Musk, obviously didn't like the jab and replied with a long-ish message saying “GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.”

Elon Musk criticizes OpenAI's deviation from mission and advocates AI accessibility for all. Musk announces xAI open sourcing Grok chatbot. OpenAI CEO Altman takes a dig at Musk's chatbot. Musk, obviously didn't like the jab and replied with a long-ish message saying “GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.”  Elon Musk has been extremely critical of ChatGPT maker OpenAI for deviating from its mission to develop AI for the benefit of humanity and taking a profit-making path. He has advocated that artificial intelligence (AI) should be accessible for all, and he has now announced that his AI startup xAI will open source Grok chatbot this week.“This week, @xAI will open source Grok,” Musk said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).In simpler words, open-sourcing a software, like a chatbot, means that the software projects are redistributable as all source code is accessible by everyone. One of the advantages of having open source software is that it provides flexibility to an enterprise to have multiple ways of fixing a problem rather than waiting for an internal team to provide a solution.“OpenAI is a lie”Meanwhile, a user suggested that OpenAI should do the same.“OpenAI should do the same if they are ‘open’ that is,” the user said. Musk replied, “OpenAI is a lie.”Musk wants AI technology to be open-source Musk had floated the idea of open-sourcing AI during a podcast in November last year. In a podcast with Lex Fridman, Musk suggested that he likes the idea of open-source AI. “I am generally in favour of open sourcing, like biassed towards open sourcing,” he said.His comments came soon after his AI company called xAI released Grok, its chatbot, which reportedly took four months to build. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was quick to take a dig at this and shared a post in which he built Grok with a single prompt on GPT Builder."GPTs can save a lot of effort:” he said.Musk, obviously didn't like the jab and replied with a long-ish message saying “GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.” About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Former Activision boss reportedly wants to buy TikTok

Bobby Kotick, former head of Activision Blizzard, may buy TikTok amid its potential US ban. A bill to sell TikTok is introduced, backed by President Biden. Kotick discussed acquisition with OpenAI head. Activision Blizzard faced a lawsuit. Concerns about data privacy and ties to China persist. TikTok urges American users to support it.

Bobby Kotick, former head of Activision Blizzard, may buy TikTok amid its potential US ban. A bill to sell TikTok is introduced, backed by President Biden. Kotick discussed acquisition with OpenAI head. Activision Blizzard faced a lawsuit. Concerns about data privacy and ties to China persist. TikTok urges American users to support it.  Bobby Kotick, the former head of Activision Blizzard, is reportedly considering buying TikTok, as the app could be banned in the United States. The Wall Street Journal reports that Kotick has talked to ByteDance, the company that owns TikTok, about buying the app, which could cost hundreds of billions of dollars.This comes as US lawmakers introduce a new bill that would make ByteDance sell TikTok within six months or stop it from being available in US app stores.President Joe Biden has said he would approve the bill if it passes in Congress.The Wall Street Journal report adds that Kotick, the head of OpenAI, Sam Altman, discussed teaming up to buy TikTok at a dinner last week. Kotick's interest in TikTok follows a rough end to his 30 years leading Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft acquired last year. The company faced a lawsuit saying it allowed sexual harassment and discrimination under Kotick's leadership. The Wall Street Journal also said Kotick knew about bad behaviour and didn't tell the board everything. Kotick was accused of harassment, but Activision Blizzard said the report was "misleading."Lawmakers are worried about data privacy and TikTok's ties to China. US President Biden, whose administration has banned the app already on state devices, has expressed his support for banning the app in the US. However, former President Donald Trump, who once wanted to ban TikTok, has changed his mind, saying a ban would help TikTok's rivals, like Facebook and YouTube. As the bill against TikTok gains support, the app has asked its American users to speak up for it, sending messages telling users to call their representatives. The bill, which passed a committee last week, is expected to be approved when the House votes on Wednesday. If it passes, it will then go to the Senate, and then the bill will be signed by the President of the US.Former Activision boss reportedly wants to buy TikTokAbout the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Why Earth Sciences minister Rijiju is upset with this European IT company



Why Earth Sciences minister Rijiju is upset with this European IT companyTOI Tech Desk / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Updated: Mar 11, 2024, 14:39 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLargeFollow us  PTI photo Earth Sciences Minister Kiren Rijiju is reportedly upset with the French IT company Atos. Reason is said to be delay in the delivery of two supercomputers by the French company to Indian weather forecasting institutes. According to a report in news agency PTI, the Earth Sciences Ministry had ordered two supercomputers worth $100 million from French firm Eviden, of the Atos Group, last year to enhance the computing capabilities of its institutions -- the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM)."I am more upset because the target we set was December. The Union Cabinet had already approved purchasing the supercomputer. We have only four petaflop capacity. We want to install up to 18 petaflop capacity," Rijiju told PTI in a video interview.He said that the French company ran into some financial trouble and wanted the government to make payment to its subsidiary.Minister says that the delay is causing him "worry"Rijiju said that the delay has caused him lots of worry as the company has overshot the timeline. "But I think we will sort it out soon," he said, adding that the government wanted to be "very correct in our position legally"."We are ready to release the money because we want the machine immediately. The only problem is the amount is not small. So if we pay now, if the company is bankrupt or something happens, who will bail out," the minister said.Rijiju further added that the government was taking some steps to speed up the delivery of the supercomputer but did not elaborate. "But I hope the French government will also intervene because we have a good understanding and a very good relationship with the French government."Since it is a high-cost equipment, we want to ensure that the transaction happens duly and properly," he said."From outside, everything's ready. It is only the problem with the main company. They want us to pay their subsidiary. We will pay only to a company whom we have entered an MoU with," Rijiju said.The supercomputing system, based on Eviden's BullSequana XH2000, is said to have a combined power capacity of up to 21.3 petaflops.Supercomputer at IITMThe supercomputer at the Pune-based IITM will provide 13 petaflops of computing power for atmosphere and climate research. As per the PTI report, it will integrate 3,000 CPU nodes using AMD EPYC 7643 processors and 26 GPU nodes through NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. The system will benefit from the NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand networking platform with In-Network Computing, 3PB all flash and 29PB disk-based DDN EXAScaler ES400NVX2 storage and Micron high-technology memory.The existing computing facility at NCMRWF is 2.8 petaflops and at IITM is 4 petaflops, respectively.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.
