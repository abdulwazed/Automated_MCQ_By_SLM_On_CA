US envoy to India: Trump picks Sergio Gor. Why did Musk call him ‘a snake’ once?

Sergio Gor, a close aide to Donald Trump, has been nominated as the US Ambassador to India, sparking controversy due to past clashes with Elon Musk. Musk previously labeled Gor a "snake" and accused him of legal violations related to security clearance paperwork. Trump defended Gor, emphasizing his loyalty and importance to US-India relations amidst ongoing tariff disputes.

Back in June, Musk branded Gor “a snake” after the New York Post revealed he had failed to submit his full security clearance paperwork despite being responsible for vetting thousands of appointees. Musk also accused him of “breaking the law” by not filing the Standard Form 86 (SF-86), required for security clearance background checks.According to the Daily Beast, Gor allegedly persuaded Trump to withdraw Musk’s close friend Jared Isaacman’s nomination to lead Nasa, days before Senate confirmation. Musk said Gor orchestrated Isaacman’s downfall to settle scores, following a confrontation during his stint on Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which aimed to slash federal spending. Musk, who quit DOGE in May, later criticised Gor for delays in staffing and clashed with him during cost-cutting reviews.According to the Post, Gor held a grudge after Musk, then serving on Trump’s task force, publicly criticised him. “Sergio was upset about Elon dressing him down at the meeting and said he was going to ‘get him,’” a source told the outlet. The tensions likely added to Musk’s rupture with Trump in early June, when he opposed the president’s sweeping tax-cut and spending bill, warning it would worsen federal debt. Days later, Musk briefly backed impeachment, prompting Trump to threaten cancellation of federal contracts with his companies.Announcing the decision on social media, Trump described Gor as “a great friend, who has been at my side for many years,” and said his appointment to New Delhi was vital at a time when Washington and New Delhi are locked in a bitter tariff dispute.“For the most populous region in the world, it is important that I have someone I can fully trust to deliver on my agenda and help us make America great again. Sergio will make an incredible Ambassador,” the president said.He highlighted Gor’s role in his campaigns, book publishing ventures, and super PACs, calling his service “essential” to the administration. Vice President JD Vance and US foreign secretary Marco Rubio also welcomed the appointment, with Rubio describing US–India relations as “the most important relationship.”Gor, 38, currently heads the White House Presidential Personnel Office, overseeing the recruitment of nearly 4,000 federal officials. He will continue in that role until the Senate confirms his appointment. In a post on X, Gor said he was “beyond grateful” to Trump for his trust, calling the ambassadorship “the honour of my life.”Gor will replace Eric Garcetti. His appointment comes as India grapples with 50 per cent US tariffs on its goods, including penalties linked to Russian oil purchases.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
