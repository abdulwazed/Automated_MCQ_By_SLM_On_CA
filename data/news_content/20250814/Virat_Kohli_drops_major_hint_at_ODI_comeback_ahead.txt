Virat Kohli (AFP Photo) NEW DELHI: Former India captain Virat Kohli, who has retired from T20Is and Tests and now focuses solely on ODIs, is gearing up for the Australia series in October after the postponement of the Bangladesh ODI series in August. Kohli recently posted a photo from an indoor net session, signalling his readiness for a return to international cricket since his last outing at the Champions Trophy.Virat Kohli on why did he retire from Test cricket: 'It's time when you...'Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!In the image shared on his Instagram story, Kohli was seen training with Gujarat Titans’ assistant coach Naeem Amin. “Thanks for helping out with the hit, brother. Always lovely to see you,” he wrote. A fan page later reposted the picture, hinting at Kohli’s preparation for the Australian ODIs — a post that received a like from Kohli’s official account.Both Kohli and Rohit Sharma continue to feature in ODIs after stepping away from T20Is and Tests. Rohit remains the ODI captain, while Kohli is still a central figure in the format. The BCCI, however, is treading carefully regarding their long-term ODI futures, with age emerging as a key discussion point. By the 2027 ODI World Cup, Rohit will be 40 and Kohli 39.Despite this, their combined ODI record — 83 centuries and over 25,000 runs — underscores their value to the team. While India have transitioned from relying on them in other formats, their impact in 50-over cricket remains significant. The Australia series, set for October 19–25, will be India’s next ODI assignment, with both veterans expected to play vital roles.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
