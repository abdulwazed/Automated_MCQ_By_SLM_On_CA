She acknowledged his role in delivering justice concerning her husband Raju Pal's murder. She credited Adityanath's zero-tolerance policy for the action against Atiq Ahmed, the accused in the 2005 killing. She highlighted the sense of trust the state now has in the Chief Minister.  Samajwadi Party MLA Pooja Pal NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party MLA Pooja Pal on Thursday thanked Uttar Pradesh chief ministerYogi Adityanath for bringing her justice, saying he had “buried” dreaded gangster Atiq Ahmed, who was behind the killing of her husband, Raju Pal.She said CM Yogi's "zero-tolerance policy" against crime delivered justice in the 2005 murder of her husband, who was the BSP MLA."Everyone knows who murdered my husband (Raju Pal). I want to thank the chief minister for bringing me justice and hearing me when nobody else did,” she said during the 24-hour marathon debate on Vision Document 2047. “The CM gave justice to many other women like me in Prayagraj by bringing in policies like zero tolerance that led to the killing of criminals like Atiq Ahmed. Today, the entire state looks at the CM with trust.”She added, “Mere pati ke hatyare Atiq Ahmed ko Mukhya Mantri ne mitti mein milaane ka kaam kiya” (The chief minister has buried my husband’s murderer Atiq Ahmed).Pooja Pal said she raised her voice when no one was ready to stand up to criminals like Atiq Ahmed. “When I started getting exhausted with this fight, CM Yogi Adityanath gave me justice,” she told the House.Raju Pal was shot dead in Prayagraj in 2005, days after his wedding. The main accused, gangster-politician Atiq Ahmed, faced trial for years without a final verdict. In February 2023, Umesh Pal, a key witness in the case, was killed in a daylight attack in Prayagraj’s Sulem Saray area. Several rounds were fired and crude bombs hurled at Umesh and his gunners.The killings reignited pressure on the state’s crackdown against organised crime. Atiq Ahmed and his brother Ashraf were later arrested. On April 15, 2023, both were shot dead by assailants posing as journalists while being escorted for a medical check-up in Prayagraj.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Activists of the left parties take part in a protest rally against alleged illegal detention and torture of Bengali-speaking migrant workers, in Kolkata (PTI photo) NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) concerning the detention and alleged torture of Bengali-speaking migrant workers under suspicion of being Bangladeshi nationals.However, Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi declined to issue an interim order regarding the detentions, listing the matter for next week; noting that such decisions would have implications, particularly for individuals who have entered from neighbouring countries.'Nazi' BJP Targeting 'Bengalis': TMC MP Mahua Moitra's Explosive Interview On Gurugram Crackdown"States where these migrant workers are working have the right to inquire from their state of origin about their bonafide but the problem is in the interregnum. If we pass any interim orders, then it will have consequences, especially those who have illegally come from across the border and need to be deported under the law," the bench said, as quoted by PTI.The top court told advocate Prashant Bhushan, representing the West Bengal Migrant Welfare Board, to await responses from the Central government and nine states: Odisha, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Delhi, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana and West Bengal.The case centres around individuals allegedly facing harassment by states solely for speaking Bengali and possessing Bengali-language documents, following a Ministry of Home Affairs circular, as argued by Bhushan."They are being detained while an inquiry is being held about their bonafide and in some cases, they are even tortured. Kindly pass some interim order that no detention will be held. I have no problem with enquiries but there should not be any detention," the advocate said in his argument.The apex court, however, did acknowledge the necessity to establish procedures to protect legitimate citizens from harassment.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

A video of a schoolboy riding a horse to school while being accompanied by a dog has gone viral on social media. The footage, reportedly captured in Meghalaya's hilly terrain, shows the student in his school uniform traveling to school on horseback, with a black dog running alongside.The clip was shared on Instagram by the account 'twinklejoanna' and quickly captured the attention of social media users across platforms. "A casual ride to school," stated the original social media post describing the footage.The combination of the young student's unconventional commute and his faithful canine companion invoked numerous reactions from viewers online.The location appears to be the West Khasi Hills region near Nongstoin, though the exact location and authenticity of the footage could not be independently verified."We saw him Saturday. It's West khasi hills right? Near nongstoin," commented a user, attempting to identify the location."A horse as a ride and a dog to see him off. The coolest guy," said another social media user.The unusual sight of a horse being used for school transportation led to humorous speculation about the school's facilities."I would like to see the parking lot of the school," remarked one curious viewer.Some users drew pop culture references from the scene."Phantom spotted, just in case anybody remembers the phantom," noted one commenter.The video particularly resonated with viewers, who appreciated the cultural aspects of Northeast India."Bro is the AURA himself. This just made my day honestly. People in NE know what they are doing," expressed an enthusiastic viewer.The presence of the dog following the horse and rider captured special attention from viewers."If only I could also go to my school on a horse, while my pet dog would have followed. Just amazing," shared one nostalgic commenter.The video presents a stark contrast to typical urban school commutes, highlighting the diverse transportation methods still prevalent in different parts of India.The footage has become what social media users term as 'aura farming,' referring to content that naturally generates significant online engagement and admiration.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The court heard arguments highlighting the severity of dog bite incidents and the need for a resolution, while also considering concerns about the removal of stray dogs from the streets and the lack of adequate shelter facilities.  NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday reserved the order on an interim prayer seeking a stay on the order by its two-judge bench over the stray dogs. While hearing, the apex court grilled the local authorities for their inaction, which led to severe problems.Huge uproar erupted after the August 11 order passed by Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan. Taking cognisance of the matter, Chief Justice B R Gavai withdrew the case and posted it for hearing on Thursday. "The whole problem is because of the inaction of local authorities," said the apex court during the hearing. Here are 10 takeaways from SC's hearing: SC's observationThe three-judge bench comprising Justices Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria reserved order on the interim prayer seeking a stay on the August 11 order of picking up strays from the streets of Delhi-NCR.The apex court grilled civic officials, saying, "The whole problem is because of the inaction of local authorities. Everyone who has filed an intervention will have to take responsibility."Children are dying, issue needs to be resolved, Delhi Govt tells SCDelhi government, during the hearing, told SC that the issue of stray dogs needs to be resolved and contested, adding that children are dying due to dog bites, causing rabies.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Delhi government, presented data before the bench saying, over 37 lakh reported dog bites in a year in the country. "Nobody is an animal hater," Mehta told the bench.Mehta told the Supreme Court that it is a contest between a vocal minority vs a silent majority who are suffering because of dog bites.'Vocal minority vs silent majority'Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who was appearing for an NGO, asserted that the situation is "very serious" and the matter needed to be argued in depth.Sibal further sought a stay on the order passed by the apex court on August 11, directing the removal of stray dogs from streets.He asked, "Has the Municipal corporation built shelter homes for dogs? Have the dogs been sterilised? Now, the dogs are being picked up. However, the order states that once sterilised, the stray dogs should not be left out in the community."Singhvi also opposed the two-bench order, saying that dog bites exist, but there have been zero rabies deaths in Delhi this year. "Of course, dog bites are bad, but you cannot create a horror situation like this," he said.The apex court will decide whether the order passed by its division bench on the stray dog issue is to be stayed or not.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

'1 person 1 vote exists since 1951': EC slams Rahul Gandhi, oppn's use of term 'vote chori'; seeks proof
The Election Commission has strongly refuted Rahul Gandhi's "vote chori" allegations, deeming them an attack on Indian voters and election staff. Gandhi claimed widespread vote theft in Karnataka, citing duplicate entries and fake addresses. The ECI challenged Gandhi to provide evidence, but Gandhi insists the data is from the Election Commission itself, daring them to deny its accuracy.

Gandhi claimed widespread vote theft in Karnataka, citing duplicate entries and fake addresses. The ECI challenged Gandhi to provide evidence, but Gandhi insists the data is from the Election Commission itself, daring them to deny its accuracy. File photo NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Thursday hit back at Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi and other INDIA bloc parties over their repeated use of the term “vote chori,” saying such “dirty phrases” were aimed at creating a false narrative. The poll body called it a direct attack on crores of Indian voters and an assault on the integrity of lakhs of election staff.The ECI stressed that the “One Person, One Vote” law has been in place since India’s first elections in 1951-52. The poll body said anyone with proof of a person voting twice should submit it to the commission with a sworn affidavit, instead of branding all voters as “chor” without evidence.PollDo you think the current electoral process in India is transparent?YesNoOn August 7, Rahul Gandhi ran through a presentation at a press conference in New Delhi, where he alleged large-scale "vote chori" (vote theft) in Karnataka’s Mahadevapura assembly segment, claiming over 1 lakh votes were "stolen" through methods such as duplicate entries, fake addresses, and bulk registrations at single addresses. "Our internal polling predicted 16 Lok Sabha seats for Congress in Karnataka; we won nine. In Mahadevapura alone, we found 100,250 votes stolen in five different ways," Gandhi had said, presenting what he called Congress’s internal analysis of voting patterns.Later, the election commission asked Rahul Gandhi to submit a formal declaration supporting his "vote chori" (vote theft) claim, along with the names of electors allegedly wrongfully included in the voter list, in order to initiate necessary proceedings.Reacting to the election commission, Rahul said: "I'm saying it publicly to everybody. Take it as an oath. This is their data, and we are displaying their data. This is not our data". "Interestingly, they haven't denied the information," he further said. "I'm a politician. What I say to the people is my word. I'm saying it publicly to everybody. Take it as an oath. This is their data, and we are displaying their data. This is not our data. This is Election Commission data. Interestingly, they haven't denied the information. They haven't told the voter list that Rahul Gandhi is talking about are wrong. Why don't you say they wrong? Because you know the truth. You know that we know that you have done this across the country," the Congress leader told news agency ANI.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the court that steps are being taken but there are “peculiar situations” in the region."You cannot ignore what happened in Pahalgam... It is for Parliament and the Executive to take a decision," the CJI said.Mehta pointed out that assembly elections were held as promised to the Constitution Bench that had upheld the abrogation of Article 370 and the bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories. He added, “This is not the time for petitioners to muddy the waters.”PollWhat do you think is the most important factor in restoring statehood to Jammu and Kashmir?Ensuring regional security and stabilityProtecting democratic rights and developmentThe petition, filed last year by academician Zahoor Ahmad Bhat and socio-political activist Khurshaid Ahmad Malik, seeks directions to restore statehood within two months. It argues that keeping J&K as a Union Territory for nearly five years has weakened its democratic setup, caused “grave losses” to development, and hurt the rights of its citizens.The plea also says the delay violates the Supreme Court’s earlier directions to restore statehood “at the earliest and as soon as possible,” especially since assembly election results were declared on October 8, 2024.In its December 2023 verdict, the Supreme Court ruled that Article 370, which gave special status to J&K, was only a temporary provision. It held that the President had the power to revoke it after the state’s Constituent Assembly ceased to exist in 1957.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta highlighted the severity of dog bite incidents and rabies deaths, emphasizing the need for a solution balancing animal welfare and public safety. Senior advocates argued against the order to catch stray dogs, questioning the availability of shelter homes and sterilization efforts, as the court reserves its decision.  NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday reserved order on interim prayer seeking a stay on August 11 order of picking up strays from the streets. While lashing out, the apex court said that the problem of stray dogs has arisen "because of the inaction of civic authorities in implementing rules and laws." The SC will decide whether the order passed by its division bench on the stray dog issue is to be stayed or not.Delhi government told the Supreme Court that it has to intervene to check the menace of stray dogs in the country as the three-judge SC bench heard the matter.Vocal minority vs a silent majority Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said that it is a contest between a vocal minority vs a silent majority who are suffering because of dog bites.Mehta told the apex court that the situation is "very serious" and the matter needs to be argued in depth. He said that children are dying and sterilisation does not stop rabies, even if you immunise them. "That does not stop the mutilation of children," he added. Mehta presented a data before Supreme Court saying "37 lakhs dog bites reported in country in 2024. Rabies deaths were 305 deaths for the same year, WHO's modelling shows a much higher number. Nobody is an animal hater." He added that children are unable to go out to play in the open. "The court will have to find a solution. A vocal minority views as against the silent suffering majority view," he continued.Order has to be stayed, says SibalA batch of top senior advocates led by Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Kapil Sibal, who were present for the cause of stray dogs, pleaded to the SC that the court's order passed on Monday to catch stray dogs has to be stayed.Meanwhile, Sibal told SC that the August 11 order directing authorities in Delhi-NCR to start picking up stray dogs needs to be stayed.While seeking a stay, Sibal, who is appearing for an NGO, asked, "Has the Municipal corporation built shelter homes for dogs? Have the dogs been sterilised? Now, the dogs are being picked up. However, the order states that once sterilised, the stray dogs should not be left out in the community." Singhvi also opposed the August 11 order and said dog bites exist, but there have been zero rabies deaths in Delhi this year. "Of course, dog bites are bad, but you cannot create a horror situation like this," he added. Stray dog row   Earlier on Wednesday, Chief Justice B R Gavai withdrew the case from a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan and posted it for rehearing on Thursday before the three-judge special bench comprising Justices Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria. Gavai's announcement came after public outrage over the apex court's directive that it passed on Monday, ordering to removal of all stray dogs and putting them in shelters by Delhi government and civic bodies of Gurugram, Noida and Ghaziabad. The two-judge bench noted that there was an "extremely grim" situation due to stray dog bites resulting in rabies.

NEW DELHI: A parliamentary panel has flagged its concerns over the authenticity of data being fed into the Jal Jeevan Mission’s (JJM’s) Integrated Management Information System (IMIS), noting that the quality of uploaded information is essential to fill the visible gaps in the ambitious scheme of providing functional tap water connection to every rural household in the country.The panel -- standing committee on water resources headed by BJP Lok Sabha MP Rajiv Pratap Rudy -- in its report tabled in Parliament on Monday also noted the absence of annual assessment of the functionality of tap water connections in 2023.The annual assessment of functionality is vital to ensure long-term source and system sustainability and corrective measures by states/UTs based on its findings.PollIs the extension of the Jal Jeevan Mission deadline to 2028 a sign of progress or failure?Sign of progressSign of failure“Being aware of the fact that actual veracity of uploaded information is essential for realising the actual ground situation and filling the visible gaps, the Committee reiterate its recommendation that the department (of drinking water and sanitation) makes sincere efforts to ensure the authenticity of the data being fed on the IMIS,” said the report.While the panel observed that the department has cited a number of steps being taken by it for water quality monitoring and surveillance, it noted that the govt “has not furnished specific reply” on ascertaining the veracity of the information uploaded by the states/UTs on JJM-IMIS.On the panel’s observation over the absence of annual assessment, the govt, in its reply, told the committee that the department has received the final report of the functionality assessment survey.It said the department’s approval of the report is in final stages and will be released and shared with states shortly for requisite course correction.Launched in Aug 2019, the JJM was meant to cover all 19.32 crore (approx) rural households in the country by 2024. However, its deadline has now been extended to 2028.About the AuthorVishwa MohanVishwa Mohan is Senior Editor at The Times of India.

The day serves as a reminder of the human cost of division and the need to strengthen harmony. File photo NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday paid tribute to victims who suffered during India's 1947 Partition on the Partition Horrors Remembrance Day, remembering the "upheaval and pain endured by countless people" after the unplanned partition.PM Modi said it's the day to honour the grit of people who faced "unimaginable loss and still find the strength to start afresh". "India observes #PartitionHorrorsRemembranceDay, remembering the upheaval and pain endured by countless people during that tragic chapter of our history. It is also a day to honour their grit...their ability to face unimaginable loss and still find the strength to start afresh," PM Modi wrote on X.PollDo you believe that remembering the Partition is important for India's unity?Yes, absolutelyNo, it's not necessaryThe PM further said: "Many of those affected went on to rebuild their lives and achieve remarkable milestones. This day is also a reminder of our enduring responsibility to strengthen the bonds of harmony that hold our country together."Union home minister Amit Shah said August 14 is the day to "remember and honour the pain of those who suffered the tragedy of Partition" and lashed out at the Congress party for dividing the nation -- calling it the dark chapter of history."Today is a day to remember and honour the pain of those who suffered the tragedy of Partition. On this day, the Congress divided the nation, wounding the pride of Mother India. Partition unleashed violence, exploitation, and atrocities, forcing millions to leave their homes. I offer my heartfelt tributes to all those who endured this suffering. The nation can never forget the history and anguish of Partition. I also pay homage to those who lost their lives in this dark chapter of our history," Shah wrote on X.Defence minister Rajnath Singh said: "Every Indian still carries a sense of compassion for those affected families. We remain fully committed to further strengthening social harmony in the country.""I pay tribute to all those brothers and sisters who endured the horrific consequences of hatred and violence following India’s Partition in 1947, and who suffered the loss of lives and property," he wrote on X. External affairs minister S Jaishankar also said that the partition caused "immense suffering and had far-reaching human and strategic consequences.""On #PartitionHorrorsRemembranceDay, we recall the resilience of those who endured this terrible tragedy. There are many lessons to be learnt from this painful chapter," the minister wrote on X.The horror of partitionThe Partition of India in 1947, which created the separate nations of India and Pakistan, was one of the most defining and traumatic events in South Asian history. Born out of political deadlock between the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League, and hastened by the British decision to leave, the division was drawn hastily along religious lines by the Radcliffe Commission. The result triggered one of the largest human migrations in history, with around 14–18 million people crossing borders -- Hindus and Sikhs moving to India, Muslims to Pakistan. The upheaval unleashed horrific communal violence, massacres, abductions, and sexual assaults, leaving more than a million dead and countless others scarred for life. Entire trains of refugees were attacked, villages were wiped out, and families were torn apart overnight. To ensure the memory of this tragedy endures, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2021 declared August 14 as Partition Horrors Remembrance Day (Vibhajan Vibhishika Smriti Diwas). The day is marked with tributes to victims, exhibitions, archival displays, and public messages reflecting on the human cost of Partition, with leaders urging unity and a commitment to never let such divisions and bloodshed occur again.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

BLA labelled foreign terrorist org as Trump plans to develop Pakistan's 'huge oil reserves'
Despite its SDGT designation in 2019, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) recently faced FTO scrutiny, coinciding with US interest in Balochistan's resources.

Trump's plans for oil reserves with Pakistan and visits from associates exploring mineral deals have fueled speculation. The BLA's Majeed Brigade, known for attacks against Pakistani and Chinese interests, has intensified its actions since 2018.  Despite being designated as Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) in 2019, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) surprisingly evaded being labelled as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) until now. However, the US state department's sudden interest in the rebel group, particularly its subsidiary Majeed Brigade, has raised eyebrows and sparked curiosity about possible motivations.The development comes close on the heels of US President Donald Trump announcing his plans to develop 'massive oil reserves' with Pakistan. The announcement attracted a response from Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch, who said that reserves of oil, natural gas, copper, lithium, uranium and rare earths were not located in actual Pakistan and belonged to "Republic of Balochistan". Baloch wrote an open letter to Trump warning him that he was misled about "massive oil reserves" in Pakistan by army chief Asim Munir.The visits to Pakistan by Gentry Beach, a close college friend of President Trump's son Donald Trump Jr, have also piqued curiosity, with the latter seeing a potential to cut deals worth billions of dollars in explorations of rare earth minerals, oil and gas, and real estate. A recent deal that Pakistan negotiated with World Liberty Financial (WLF), a cryptocurrency venture in which the Trump family has a 60% stake, has also fuelled speculation.Though it had its roots founded in the 70s, the Majeed Brigade was a little-known entity until a decade ago. The brigade comprises fidayeen (suicide bombers) who have been fighting the Pakistan-China collaboration opposed to its freedom struggle. "It was in the 1970s that Abdul Majeed Baloch carried out a failed assassination bid on Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the former Pakistan PM who dismissed the National Awami Party's govt in Balochistan," recalled a source.However, it was in 2010-11 that the brigade was formally constituted in the memory of Abdul Majeed. Since then, the brigade has carried out numerous suicide attacks against Pakistani security forces and Chinese nationals working for China-Pakistan Economic Corridor projects in Balochistan and Sindh. The attacks have intensified since 2018. Their most lethal hit was on the Jaffar Express, in which BLA claimed it eliminated 214 Pak military personnel.About the AuthorRaj Shekhar JhaRaj Shekhar Jha is a journalist for the Times of India with over a decade of experience in reporting on national security, terrorism, crime and prisons.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Seeds that supercharge muscle growth and overall healthFrom Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leavesTop 5 Getaways in North and South India to Work RemotelyFrom Cristiano Ronaldo’s million-dollar sparkler to Arjun Tendulkar’s intimate proposal: Celebrity engagements that created buzz in 2025Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 expensive animal-shaped bags that’ll leave you almost shocked!Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

"This time I am not going to lose my cool," Justice Pardiwala said at the outset with a smile on his face. The case before it, in which an FIR was filed against a couple for not paying their dues to a seller, who lodged a complaint for recovery of the money, had been adjudicated by the Rajasthan high court. Granting anticipatory bail to the couple, the court said that litigants were forced to move the apex court for relief because proper law was not being applied by lower courts and high courts, which leads to unnecessary litigation and harassment of litigants. In this case, the couple had purchased plywood from a seller and paid Rs 3 lakh but then allegedly refused to pay the balance amount of Rs 12 lakh, making the seller file a case against them. tnnSC: A little application of mind by HCs will curb such litigation   The bench held that the problem of not following well-settled law was prevalent across the country and said a little application of mind by HCs would go a long way in curbing such litigation.Appearing against the couple, state govt questioned their conduct, as they had been on the run. The bench, however, said this could be because of the fear of police.The bench also disapproved of the stand of the public prosecutor before the HC, contending that it would not be possible to recover the money if bail was granted to the couple. "According to the state, police machinery is required to be involved in the recovery of money. Why do you want police to be involved for recovery of money - to squeeze the remaining amount for the seller?" it asked the advocate appearing for the state.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Seeds that supercharge muscle growth and overall healthFrom Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leavesTop 5 Getaways in North and South India to Work RemotelyFrom Cristiano Ronaldo’s million-dollar sparkler to Arjun Tendulkar’s intimate proposal: Celebrity engagements that created buzz in 2025Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 expensive animal-shaped bags that’ll leave you almost shocked!Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court prima facie disagreed on Wednesday with the argument that the Election Commission had no authority to conduct an intensive revision of electoral rolls and observed that it was within the sole domain of the poll panel to decide when and how to conduct the exercise. A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi also said that the SIR being conducted in Bihar is voter friendly and not exclusionary.The bench's remark came when senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for Association for Democratic Reforms, excoriated EC for conducting an "unconstitutional" exercise at its whims and fancies to "delete" voters from the draft Bihar electoral rolls. This also led the justices to emphasise that election laws and rules leave it to the EC's discretion to devise the procedure for conducting SIR for any constituency.Rahul Gandhi Doubles Down On 'Vote Chori' Allegations, Oppn MPs Protest In Parliament Over Bihar SIR"It is the exclusive prerogative of EC to decide how and when to conduct special revision of electoral rolls," the bench said, adding that if there are irregularities or errors in the procedure of conducting SIR in Bihar, it would seek a response from EC and correct it, if needed.PollShould the voter list be static or revised periodically?It should be static.It should be revised periodically."EC has not undone the entire voter list. It has taken the 2003 voter list as a milestone and presumes pre-existence of voters," the bench said.SC: Voter list can't be static, must be revised periodically It can't be argued that there is complete absence of power with EC to conduct special revision of electoral rolls. The law says it can be done constituency-wise and in such a manner as EC deems proper," the bench said.West Bengal, through senior advocates Sankaranarayanan and Kalyan Banerjee, raised the issue of SIR being conducted without mandatory consultation with state govt. The bench said the state's challenge to SIR can wait till the adjudication of the petition against the revision of Bihar's electoral rolls.Senior advocate A M Singhvi attempted to persuade the court to allow the 2003 list, with additions as of the last general elections, to be the electoral roll for the upcoming Bihar elections. "No one is against SIR, if it is conducted in Dec 2025 and the exercise takes a year," he said.The bench disagreed. "Instead of seven documents specified earlier for revision of electoral rolls, EC has expanded it to 11 documents. It shows the exercise is voter friendly and not exclusionary," said the justices.Singhvi said the documents, apart from Aadhaar, ration card and voter ID card, are available only with a minuscule percentage.Sankaranarayanan argued that the right to be included in an electoral roll is a constitutional right if a person did not suffer any of the specified disqualifications. The bench said, "The voter list cannot be static. It must be revised periodically."Advocate Prashant Bhushan said, "I can give guarantee that not more than 25% of the over 7 crore people who submitted enumeration forms have not submitted any document supporting their nationality. Booth-level officers, as per whims and fancies, have not recommended a whopping 10% to 12% of people in... Darbhanga and Kaimur for inclusion in the voter list."He said EC had put the draft voter list on its website after Aug 1 but removed it on Aug 4 after Rahul Gandhi held a press conference about "voter manipulation". SC said, "We do not know of any such press conference."Senior advocate Shadan Farasat said the names of 65 lakh deleted from the draft voter list must be restored. SC said, "We cannot bring the dead back and make them vote." Arguments will continue on Thursday.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousZodiac signs who are known for their simplicityastrologyDipika Kakar’s top 10 gorgeous ethnic looks for festive seasontvJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Movies that made us question everything we thought we knewSara Tendulkar’s protein drinks: How to make them and their benefitsWhy is the Peepal tree worshipped in India5 early symptoms of Diabetes in men that should not be ignoredCardiologist says these blood tests that can predict heart disease risks even before symptoms appearTemples, Taj, and Thar: An epic 15-day adventure in the heart of North IndiaThis is how cooking meat may increase the risk of cancerFrom bullied schoolboy to ₹3,000 crore superstar – Hrithik Roshan’s inspiring journeyHow to see incredible India in just two weeksSeeds that supercharge muscle growth and overall health123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillVanessa BryantDwyane WadeKyrie lrvingNHL Trade RumorsRaj KundraCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteWatch: Meghalaya boy riding horse to school, faithful dog trots along;

The direction was based on findings of an SC-constituted SIT, which gave a stinging report into the functioning of Noida Authority, finding, among other things, decision-making centralised in the hands of a few officers.Accepting SIT's recommendations, a bench of justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi ordered: "In order to infuse transparency and fairness as well as a citizen-centric approach in the day-to-day functioning of Noida, we direct UP chief secretary to place the recommendation... before the council of ministers for an appropriate decision."Till that decision is taken, the bench directed the chief secretary to post a chief vigilance officer, who should be an IPS officer or an officer on deputation from CAG, in Noida for a financial audit.According to SIT, Noida officers were involved in 20 cases of excess payment of compensation to landowners. Led by IPS officer SB Shiradkar, SIT also concluded that Noida's land allotment policies favour builders, and there was a lack of transparency and fairness in the development authority's overall functioning.Form citizen advisory board for Noida in 4 weeks: SC to UP government    It sought an inquiry into assets of officers and their relatives for a proper look at who benefited from excess compensation that Noida paid out.Commenting on the functioning of Noida, SIT said discretionary powers exercised by its officers in allotment of land is such that very soon, there will be no land available in Delhi's neighbouring city for future development purposes. It also flagged the lack of process to garner public view and conduct environment impact assessments for projects in Noida. SIT said residents often complain of delay and inadequate resolution of grievances, as Noida Authority acts reactively rather than proactively.The Justice Kant-led bench directed the chief secretary to set up a citizen advisory board for Noida in four weeks and banned giving effect to any project in Noida without environmental impact assessment and clearance from SC's green bench.In the 20 cases where excess compensation was paid to landowners because of alleged collusion of Noida officials who were identified by SIT, the bench constituted another SIT to conduct a probe into each of these officers and register FIRs on detection of a cognisable offence. It asked the authority to grant sanction for prosecution against delinquent officials within four weeks of SIT seeking it."The SIT headed by a police officer not below the rank of commissioner of police will register preliminary enquiries (PEs) and proceed to inquire into the illustratively highlighted points (in the previous SIT report) and involve experts from forensic account department as well as economic offences wing. If the SIT, after preliminary enquiry, finds commission of cognizable offence, it would register FIRs," the bench said.The court asked this SIT to submit a probe status report but clarified that excess compensation paid to landowners would not be recovered.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousDipika Kakar’s top 10 gorgeous ethnic looks for festive seasontvJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainment Next123 Photostories  Sara Tendulkar’s protein drinks: How to make them and their benefitsWhy is the Peepal tree worshipped in India5 early symptoms of Diabetes in men that should not be ignoredCardiologist says these blood tests that can predict heart disease risks even before symptoms appearTemples, Taj, and Thar: An epic 15-day adventure in the heart of North IndiaThis is how cooking meat may increase the risk of cancerFrom bullied schoolboy to ₹3,000 crore superstar – Hrithik Roshan’s inspiring journeyHow to see incredible India in just two weeksSeeds that supercharge muscle growth and overall healthFrom Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leaves123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillVanessa BryantDwyane WadeKyrie lrvingNHL Trade RumorsShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteHouse panel flags concerns over quality of data for assessing JJM’s performance'Tragic chapter': PM Modi, Amit Shah pay tribute to victims on Partition Horrors Remembrance Day; honour their gritBLA labelled foreign terrorist org as Trump plans to develop Pakistan's 'huge oil reserves'Rajasthan high court order disappointing, but won't lose cool this time: Supreme Court's Pardiwala benchWhen and how to conduct SIR is Election Commission's exclusive domain: Supreme CourtConsider converting Noida to a metropolitan council: Supreme Court to UP govtAll cinemas must screen 1 Bengali film per day: Mamata BanerjeeAdoption law frustrating, needs to be simplified: Supreme CourtDragon-Elephant Tango?

Till now, 12pm to 9pm was considered prime time and so Bengali movies were slotted at 12pm. We've changed the prime-time slot from 3pm to 9pm," minister Aroop Biswas said Wednesday.Earlier, all theatres were required to screen at least 120 Bengali films a year.Information and culture minister Indranil Sen called it a "historic day not only for cinema but for the revival of Bengali asmita and culture".'Screening 1 Bengali film a day will expand language market' Film industry seniors said the decision to screen at least one Bengali film during the 3pm-9pm prime slot could potentially expand the market for Bengali cinema and encourage new producers to invest in language content."This initiative will allow the audience to decide when it is most convenient for them to watch a Bengali film," said actor Prosenjit Chatterjee. Actor-politician Dev said the notification was a "significant win for the Bengali film industry".Multiplex audiences have long complained about the absence of Bengali films in popular late afternoon and evening slots, while directors have expressed frustration that despite positive reviews, their films are often removed from prime slots after only three days.About the AuthorPriyanka DasguptaPriyanka Dasgupta is the features editor of TOI Kolkata.

It said not having children is a social stigma and such parents "want a child badly but the process is cumbersome".The total number of adoptions crossed 4,500 in 2025-26 as of March 31, the highest in 11 years.Average waiting period for adopting kids is 3.5 years However, for many prospective adoptive parents (PAPs), the process of adopting a child continues to be a challenge with an average of 3.5 years waiting period for those seeking infants and young children. The Central Adoption Resource Authority (Cara) dashboard shows there are over 36,616 PAPs across various categories registered to adopt while the number of children available for adoption is merely 2,756."The present adoption process is taking too long. Parents want a child badly but the process is cumbersome and frustrating for them," SC said. It added the existing flaw in the system was reflected in a case that was decided by it a day before, in which four parents from Telangana had adopted children, but not as per the procedure laid down by law, and police thereafter took away custody. The court allowed the plea of the four adoptive parents and restored custody of the children - aged between a few months and three years - to them by invoking its extraordinary power under Article 142 of the Constitution.In this case, the petitioners had adopted the children after they came to know that their biological parents were not willing to keep them. They did not involve the authority concerned in the process and took custody of the children without informing it. But state the police took away the children after it came to know about the adoption, and the children were handed over to the Child Welfare Project Director and Integrated Child Protection Services.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  From Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leavesTop 5 Getaways in North and South India to Work RemotelyFrom Cristiano Ronaldo’s million-dollar sparkler to Arjun Tendulkar’s intimate proposal: Celebrity engagements that created buzz in 2025Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 expensive animal-shaped bags that’ll leave you almost shocked!Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

Why Modi is headed to ChinaDragon-Elephant Tango? Why Modi is headed to ChinaSachin Parashar / TNN /  Aug 14, 2025, 06:52 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLarge  Just a year ago, it would perhaps have taken a big leap of faith for PM Narendra Modi to travel to China. The two countries’ relationship was still on ventilator. The border was relatively quiet, but disengagement of troops at the remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh was still incomplete.Now, as Modi gets ready to visit Tianjin later this month, it seems the most unambivalent thing to do, grounded in a realistic understanding of global uncertainties and the need to reinforce its multialignment.It helps, of course, that the agreement Modi reached with President Xi Jinping on the margins of the Brics summit in Oct — that disputes and differences would not be allowed to disturb border peace — has remained unimpaired. While India’s official announcement is awaited, Modi’s visit is all but certain; so is Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi’s to India next week for talks with NSA Ajit Doval and external affairs minister S Jaishankar.Multilateral, But Still…Granted, Modi’s visit is for a multilateral event: the summit meeting of the SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organisation), a 10-member security-oriented Eurasian grouping dominated by China and Russia, seen as a potential counterweight to Nato. Modi’s last visit to China, in 2018, was also for the SCO summit.Given the state of its ties with China and Pakistan, India is a bit of an outlier in the group, as it doesn’t join others in endorsing initiatives like the BRI (Belt and Road Initiative). In 2023, it also backed out of an economic roadmap as it seemed more aligned with Chinese interests. More recently, India also refused to sign on to a joint statement condemning Israel’s attack on Iran.However, India acknowledges SCO’s role in combating terrorism, particularly in Afghanistan, promoting connectivity that doesn’t undermine sovereignty and territorial integrity, and facilitating its own ties with Central Asia. Modi has used the SCO Heads of State Council meeting, the highest decision-making body of the organisation, to draw attention to cross-border terrorism, without naming Pakistan.SCO has also had an important role to play in bringing India and China together. Russia may not have actively mediated between India and China, but it has nudged both sides to use the forum to engage with each other after 2020’s Galwan clash.The Moscow Consensus, within three months of Galwan — on the margins of the SCO foreign ministers’ meeting in the Russian capital — to ease tensions is a case in point. President Xi Jinping in 2023 also participated in the SCO summit Modi hosted virtually under India’s presidency.However, Modi has also skipped SCO summit meetings. He missed one in Kazakhstan last year. If Modi is travelling to China, it’s because he understands the salience Xi has attached to the Tianjin summit under China’s presidency, prioritising it over Brics this year, and the need to normalise a relationship that he believes is important not just for India and China, but the entire world. Support from China will also be crucial for India’s Brics presidency next year.Peaks & TroughsTrump’s foreign policy has wrongfooted India but, to be fair to the Indian govt, India and China started to rebuild ties long before the US president sent the world careening towards an apocalyptic trade war. In fact, the agreement to end the military standoff in eastern Ladakh happened even before the US presidential elections.By visiting China, Modi is signalling that India is ready to have a sound working relationship with Beijing — as long as border peace and tranquillity is not disturbed. When NSA Doval visited China last Dec, both sides agreed to maintain peace on the ground so that “issues on the border do not hold back the normal development of bilateral relations”.India has not allowed China’s military cooperation with Pakistan — even after Operation Sindoor — to ruin the Sino-Indian thaw, and Beijing was muted in its criticism of India’s first joint patrolling of the South China Sea with the Philippines, suggesting a readiness from both sides to take a long view of the relationship. Modi’s bilateral meeting with Xi, which might see important announcements (such as the resumption of direct flights), is an opportunity for both sides to rebuild trust for a mutually beneficial partnership in areas like trade, investment and emerging technologies, in which China is a global leader.India will expect China to reciprocate by addressing some of its trade restrictions related to manpower and equipment that impact Indian manufacturing, and deliver on the promise to import more to reduce the $100 billion trade deficit. India will also be mindful of China’s efforts to undercut its influence in the neighbourhood and the larger Indo-Pacific. China will expect, as ambassador Xu Feihong told TOI recently, a transparent and non-discriminatory business environment for its companies.The dragon-elephant tango may have just started but, in these circumstances, it will remain accident-prone. The way the relationship has peaked and troughed from the initial Modi years to the Doklam crisis, and again from the excitement over the informal summits to the Galwan despair, serves as an important lesson. The answer probably lies in Modi’s recent remark, quickly endorsed by Beijing, that competition should not be allowed to turn into conflict.So, Is It Bye-Bye America?Not really. Modi has, in the past, attended several SCO summits where he has met Xi — and all it has signified is India’s strategic autonomy. His upcoming visit to China is drawing more attention because of the state of India’s ties with the US.India and the US seemed set to embark on a new phase in the relationship, based on robust and next-generation defence and technology collaborations, along with stronger energy ties, when Trump dropped his tariff bomb, doubling the levy on India for its oil imports from Russia.But it will probably take more than one individual, even if he’s the US president, to do any structural damage to a relationship successive American presidents have called one of the most defining partnerships of the 21st century.Amid calls for India to take on the Trump administration, the govt itself has chosen to avoid confrontation. Trump is known to take maximalist positions ahead of trade agreements, and India is still willing to negotiate. India’s statement that the relationship has weathered such challenges in the past has been received well by the US State Department. The visit to China registers India’s position against Western unilateralism, but India is not giving up on America yet. A possible return of peace in Ukraine can also wipe out half of India’s tariff woes.Three Things To Note For IndiaThere are three things India will guard against, though. The first is whether Trump, chasing a watershed trade deal with China, will remain as committed to the Indo-Pacific as he was during his previous term, when he revived Quad. The tariff issue has cast a shadow on the upcoming Quad summit India has to host in early Nov. If Trump doesn’t come, there will be questions raised about the US’s long-standing policy of dealing with India as a country that can ensure a sustainable balance of power in the region. India’s efforts to restore ties with China help it hedge against this eventuality.Second is the strong counterterrorism cooperation that will likely be diluted by Trump’s remarkable turnaround on Pakistan — from accusing it of hoodwinking US presidents on the issue of terrorism to treating it as a lodestar in the fight against the menace. Re-hyphenating India with Pakistan can potentially cause irreparable damage to relations with India.Third is the impending H-1B overhaul, and the likely impact on Indian professionals in the IT and healthcare sectors. This is sure to ignite another diplomatic firestorm, damaging people-to-people contacts and what India sees as a mutually beneficial economic and technology partnership.All three are issues that will test India’s resolve and push the limits of Indian diplomacy.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  From Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leavesTop 5 Getaways in North and South India to Work RemotelyFrom Cristiano Ronaldo’s million-dollar sparkler to Arjun Tendulkar’s intimate proposal: Celebrity engagements that created buzz in 2025Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 expensive animal-shaped bags that’ll leave you almost shocked!Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

Virk is accused of impersonating law enforcement officers and participating in a Rs 6 crore fraud.  NEW DELHI: ED has arrested Sandeepa Virk, a social media influencer who also ran an online platform with little business, allegedly a front for money laundering.The arrest followed a police case registered in Mohali, with the probe agency conducting raids on Tuesday and Wednesday at multiple locations in Delhi and Mumbai, ED said in a press release.The agency said it found that Virk, who acted in movies and claims to be a cosmetologist, was in regular touch with Angarai Natarajan Sethuraman, a former director of Reliance Capital, which was part of the Anil Ambani group. The ED statement alleged Virk had been communicating with Sethuraman regarding illegal liaising work. It added that this was also confirmed during searches at the residence of Sethuraman, who was a prominent member of the business group's corporate affairs team in Delhi.When contacted, Sethuraman said, "These allegations are entirely baseless" and that he had no connection or involvement with Virk or any transactions related to her.ED alleges diversion of funds by Sethuraman  In a release, ED said, "Besides, diversion of funds for personal benefit has been unearthed during course of search. In 2018, public money of Rs 18 crore approx belonging to Reliance Commercial Finance Ltd was disbursed to Sethuraman by flouting prudent lending norms. The funds were lent under terms that allowed deferment of principal as well as interest, with multiple waivers granted & no due diligence conducted. Besides, home loan of Rs 22 crore was provided by Reliance Capital Limited by violating the prudential norms. Large part of these loans are seen to have been eventually siphoned off and remained unpaid."Sethuraman said that the home loan he received from Reliance Capital was granted following due process and was secured by the property offered as collateral.Following her arrest, Virk was produced before a special court here on Wednesday, which remanded her to ED custody till Aug 14. Virk's arrest came after searches conducted by the agency in Delhi and Mumbai on her premises and those of her close associates,She is accused of impersonating officers of law enforcement agencies, duping individuals, and participating in a Rs 6 crore fraud against complainant Jasneet Kaur, under the pretext of investment in a film project. The main accused in the fraud, Amit Gupta alias Nageshwar Gupta, was declared a proclaimed offender in Oct 2024.The agency claimed during its searches, it seized "incriminating documents" and records, and statements of key persons and associates, including Farrukh Ali, were recorded. ED said its current searches were part of an ongoing investigation into charges against Virk and her associates, who are alleged to have "exerted undue influence through misrepresentation and defrauded individuals by soliciting money under false promises"."Virk has acquired immovable property in her name by making false promises and cheating. She claims to be owner of hyboocare.com, a website purportedly selling FDA-approved beauty products. However, the products listed on the site have been found to be non-existent," the agency said. It added that its probe revealed that the website floated by Virk lacked basics, such as user registration options. Scrutiny of the website uncovered minimal social media engagement, an inactive WhatsApp contact number, and absence of transparent organisational details, all of which reinforce suspicion of non-genuine commercial activity, ED said.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  From Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leavesTop 5 Getaways in North and South India to Work RemotelyFrom Cristiano Ronaldo’s million-dollar sparkler to Arjun Tendulkar’s intimate proposal: Celebrity engagements that created buzz in 2025Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 expensive animal-shaped bags that’ll leave you almost shocked!Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

The bill, expected to pass in the upcoming assembly session, increases jail terms and allows arrests without warrants.  DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand cabinet on Wednesday gave its nod to a strict Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Bill, 2025, which provides for a maximum punishment of life imprisonment and fine of up to Rs 10 lakh for "forced conversion". The govt is likely to table the bill in the House, where they have a strong majority, for approval during the three-day monsoon session of assembly commencing on Aug 19.At present, the maximum jail term for such an offence is 10 years and the highest fine is Rs 50,000. The new bill proposes to raise the jail term to 14 years, and, in some cases, to 20 years which may even extend to life imprisonment. Arrests can be made without a warrant and the DM can seize properties acquired through crimes related to conversion. CM Pushkar Singh Dhami told TOI on Wednesday hours after the cabinet decision: "Uttarakhand is Devbhoomi (the land of Gods) and a place where holy saints through the ages came and meditated. In the last few years, there have been instances of demographic changes under the guise of illegal conversions. The proposed amendment is a major step on our part to ensure that the social fabric of the Himalayan state is not changed. Therefore, we have come up with stringent measures to check the illegal practice."Proposal: All offences under new provisions shall be non-bailable  According to the cabinet's proposal, "Whoever receives funds from foreign or (other) entities concerning unlawful religious conversion shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than seven years and which may extend up to 14 years, and shall also be liable to a fine not less than Rs 10 lakh." It further states, "Whoever, with the intent to convert, instils fear for life or property, assaults or uses force, promises marriage or incites or conspires for such conversion, or traffics a minor woman or person or otherwise sells them, or attempts or conspires for this purpose, shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than 20 years and which may extend to life imprisonment, meaning imprisonment for the remainder of that person's natural life, and shall also be liable to a fine."As per the new provisions, concealing religion for marriage is a crime, and offenders could face three to 10 years in prison and a fine of Rs 3 lakh. On "mass conversion", the document says it will attract imprisonment of not less than seven years and up to 14 years, and shall be liable to a fine not less than Rs 1 lakh.Concerning "a minor, woman or a person belonging to a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe, or a disabled or mentally challenged person", the punishment shall be imprisonment not less than five years, which may extend up to 14 years and liable to a fine not less than Rs 1 lakh. For general cases, the jail term would range from three years to 10 years and a fine of Rs 50,000.All offences under the new provisions shall be cognizable and non-bailable and triable by a sessions court. Arrests can be made without a warrant and bail will only be granted if the court is convinced the accused is not guilty and will not repeat the offence. As per the proposal, if any property is acquired through crimes related to conversion, the DM can seize it. The provision mentions: "If the DM has reason to believe that any property in possession of a person, whether movable or immovable, was acquired as a result of an offence under this Act, they may order the seizure of such property, regardless of whether a court has taken cognisance of such offence."Provisions of the Indian Civil Protection Code shall apply to every such seizure, with necessary modifications. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Code, the district magistrate may appoint an administrator for any property seized under subsection (1) and the administrator shall have all powers to manage it in the best interest of such property. The district magistrate may arrange for police assistance for the proper and effective management of such property by the administrator."The amendment has also redefined "inducement", which now means and includes offering any of the following: "Any gift, gratification, easy money, or material benefit in cash or kind. Employment, free education in a school or college run by a religious institution, or a promise to marry or a better lifestyle, divine displeasure or otherwise. Portraying the practices, rituals and ceremonies of one religion in a harmful manner concerning another religion, or glorifying one religion against another."About the AuthorKautilya SinghA Senior Assistant Editor in TOI with an inclination towards political reporting.

The case has been reassigned to a three-judge bench led by Justice Vikram Nath for rehearing.  NEW DELHI: In a significant decision coming two days after Justice J B Pardiwala-led two-judge bench's controversial order for removal of all stray dogs from Delhi and NCR streets, Chief Justice B R Gavai Wednesday withdrew the case from that bench and posted it for rehearing on Thursday before a three-judge special bench led by Justice Vikram Nath.In the much-criticised Aug 11 order, Justices Pardiwala and R Mahadevan had directed Delhi and NCR civic authorities to "start picking up and rounding up stray dogs from all localities of Delhi, Ghaziabad, Noida, Faridabad, Gurgaon as well as areas on the outskirts, and relocate these dogs to designated shelters/pounds."Prompted by pleas from two counsel - one of whom pointed to the order's apparent conflict with a previous judgment of another apex court bench - and the excoriating criticism of SC by animal lovers, activists and the public, CJI Gavai moved speedily to withdraw the matter from Justice Pardiwala's bench and assign it to Justices Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria.Apex court disposed of two dozen pleas last yr On May 9, 2024, a bench of Justices J K Maheshwari and Sanjay Karol had passed an elaborate order disposing of two dozen petitions filed by Kerala, Animal Welfare Board, NGOs and animal lovers appealing against conflicting high court orders on removal of stray dogs.On Wednesday morning, a counsel had mentioned before the CJI that the Aug 11 order was in conflict with last year's SC judgment, which had ordered civic bodies to act with compassion and strictly inaccordance with the Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules, 2023, while dealing with stray dogs.Another counsel appeared before the CJI at 4 pm and complained that while the Aug 11 order was not yet available, authorities had begun implementing it.Also Read: 'Delhi people are fed up of stray dogs': What CM Rekha Gupta said on Supreme Court order; says 'we want to provide relief'In their 2024 judgment, the bench of Justices Maheshwari and Karol had said, "Under all circumstances, there cannot be any indiscriminate killings of canines, and authorities have to take action in terms of the mandate and spirit of the prevalent legislation(s) in place. There is no gainsaying the fact that exhibiting compassion to all living beings is the enshrined constitutional value and mandate and casts obligation on the authorities to maintain it."The Aug 11 order is also not in harmony with the Animal Birth Control rules which prohibit relocation of stray dogs.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Why is the Peepal tree worshipped in India5 early symptoms of Diabetes in men that should not be ignoredCardiologist says these blood tests that can predict heart disease risks even before symptoms appearTemples, Taj, and Thar: An epic 15-day adventure in the heart of North IndiaThis is how cooking meat may increase the risk of cancerFrom bullied schoolboy to ₹3,000 crore superstar – Hrithik Roshan’s inspiring journeyHow to see incredible India in just two weeksSeeds that supercharge muscle growth and overall healthFrom Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leavesTop 5 Getaways in North and South India to Work Remotely123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillVanessa BryantDwyane WadeKyrie lrvingNHL Trade RumorsShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteHouse panel flags concerns over quality of data for assessing JJM’s performance'Tragic chapter': PM Modi, Amit Shah pay tribute to victims on Partition Horrors Remembrance Day; honour their gritBLA labelled foreign terrorist org as Trump plans to develop Pakistan's 'huge oil reserves'Rajasthan high court order disappointing, but won't lose cool this time: Supreme Court's Pardiwala benchWhen and how to conduct SIR is Election Commission's exclusive domain: Supreme CourtConsider converting Noida to a metropolitan council: Supreme Court to UP govtAll cinemas must screen 1 Bengali film per day: Mamata BanerjeeAdoption law frustrating, needs to be simplified: Supreme CourtDragon-Elephant Tango?

The gift builds on decades of Booth’s philanthropy to KU and cements the Gateway project as a civic, athletic, and economic catalyst for Lawrence.David G. Booth net worth: KU alumnus behind historic $300 million gift to University of KansasBooth, a Lawrence High and KU graduate, co-founded Dimensional Fund Advisors in 1981 and is widely credited with bringing financial-science methods to everyday investing. As of June 30, 2025, Dimensional managed $853 billion in assets, underscoring Booth’s stature in global finance.His KU ties are deep: beyond this new gift, Booth has supported the university across athletics and academics for decades including the donation of James Naismith’s original rules of basketball and a foundational football-stadium gift that led to the facility bearing his name. David G. Booth, with an estimated net worth of $5 billion as reported by Celebrity Net Worth, has been a major benefactor of the University of Kansas. In 2004, he donated $9 million to the Booth Family Hall of Athletics. Married to Suzanne Deal with two children, the couple famously purchased James Naismith’s original 13 basketball rules for $4.3 million and donated them to KU, honoring Naismith’s legacy as the university’s basketball founder and nine-season head coach.Booth’s $75 million gift boosts Kansas athletics and Gateway District Phase IIBooth’s commitment does two things:$75 million is designated to jump-start Gateway District Phase II and continue stadium work.The remainder is structured to generate an ongoing income stream that will fund Kansas Athletics “across generations,” providing flexibility in an era of revenue sharing and rapid change in the college landscape as reported by University of KansasKansas AD Travis Goff called the gift “transformative” for accelerating construction and creating new, sustainable revenue. Gateway District Phase II adds 162-room hotel, student housing, and event plazaAs per the local news reports of Kansas, Phase II extends the mixed-use district on the stadium’s east side and is designed to activate the campus edge year-round—not only on game days. Current city-approved plans include:A 162-room hotel connected to the conference center443 beds of student housing~43,000 sq. ft. of retail/restaurant/office~1,000 parking spacesAn outdoor event plazaThese elements were green-lit alongside a package of local incentives that capped public bonds and set accountability provisions.Ku Gateway District Phase I and II: $450M stadium upgrades and east-side expansionPhase I (southwest, west, and north sides; major football complex upgrades) represents about $450 million in investment and will be complete for the Aug. 23 home opener vs Fresno State.Phase II focuses on the east side of the stadium and the surrounding district components outlined above. While KU has not released a final construction timetable, Booth’s gift allows work to move forward after the 2025 season. On August 12, 2025, the Lawrence City Commission approved a package of financial tools—TIF and STAR bond districts among them—worth about $94.6 million to support Phase II (roughly 27% of that phase’s costs). The development agreement includes:A cap on public bonding and evidence-of-completion requirementsA KU commitment to create an off-campus housing office (within 18 months)City access to up to $14.5 million in new district tax revenues for local corridor and stormwater improvementsKU Gateway District to boost tourism, downtown growth, and community relationsCommissioners and stakeholders cited the district’s potential to drive tourism, support downtown, and enhance Lawrence’s town-gown relationship.Beyond bricks and mortar, Booth’s design—front-loading construction while endowing a recurring revenue stream—positions KU to remain strategic and innovative amid new financial realities (e.g., revenue sharing, NIL, conference realignment). The approach gives Kansas the capacity to invest in programs sustainably, rather than relying solely on annual fundraising cycles. Booth’s Long KU legacy: From Naismith’s rules to a reimagined stadiumBooth’s philanthropy spans decades:2004–2011: Support for the Booth Family Hall of Athletics and donation of Naismith’s original rules, now displayed at the DeBruce Center.2017–2018: A $50 million foundational stadium gift and, subsequently, the naming of David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium.2025: The new ~$300 million commitment to propel Gateway Phase II and secure long-term athletics funding.Also Read | This African country has no mobile internet access; here’s the surprising truth behind its digital blackoutAbout the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

One night, thousands dead: Lake Nyos tragedy that killed 1,700 people overnight in Cameroon
In 1986, Lake Nyos in Cameroon experienced a devastating limnic eruption, releasing a massive carbon dioxide cloud that killed approximately 1,700 people and 3,500 animals. This rare phenomenon, caused by the sudden release of accumulated CO2, prompted scientific investigation and the implementation of degassing systems to prevent future disasters.

This rare phenomenon, caused by the sudden release of accumulated CO2, prompted scientific investigation and the implementation of degassing systems to prevent future disasters.  On 21 August 1986, Lake Nyos in northwestern Cameroon became the site of one of the deadliest natural disasters in modern history. A sudden limnic eruption released a massive cloud of carbon dioxide (CO2), a gas denser than air, which swept down the surrounding valleys, suffocating people and livestock in nearby villages. Within hours, approximately 1,700 people and 3,500 animals were killed. This catastrophic event shocked the world, as scientists struggled to understand how a seemingly peaceful volcanic lake could unleash such a lethal, invisible force in mere minutes. Even today, Lake Nyos remains a key case study for natural hazard scientists worldwide.What caused the Lake Nyos disaster? Understanding the mechanics behind the deadly limnic eruptionThe Lake Nyos disaster was caused by a rare natural phenomenon known as a limnic eruption. Limnic eruptions occur when deep lake water becomes saturated with gases, particularly carbon dioxide, which is released suddenly when the water overturns. In the case of Lake Nyos, CO2 had accumulated over decades in the deep layers of the lake, trapped under high pressure. Scientists believe several potential triggers may have initiated the catastrophic outgassing: a minor landslide into the lake, small volcanic activity beneath the lakebed, or unusually heavy rainfall that disturbed the stratified water layers. When the dense CO2-saturated water rose rapidly to the surface, the gas came out of solution explosively, forming a heavy cloud that flowed down surrounding valleys, displacing oxygen and suffocating anything in its path.This rare and unpredictable phenomenon highlights the hidden dangers of certain volcanic lakes, which may appear harmless on the surface but harbor lethal forces beneath.The deadly impact on people and livestock: Eyewitness accounts and the scale of devastationThe CO2 cloud generated by Lake Nyos traveled at speeds of 20–50 kilometres per hour, hugging the ground due to its higher density compared with air. It flowed into nearby villages within a 25-kilometre radius, including Nyos, Kam, Cha, and Subum, instantly killing people and animals. Eyewitnesses described waking to an overwhelming smell of sulfur or rotten eggs, collapsing unconscious, and finding family members lifeless around them. In total, around 1,700 people and 3,500 livestock died within hours, while approximately 4,000 survivors were forced to flee their homes. Many of these survivors suffered from respiratory issues, paralysis, and pressure-induced lesions caused by the suffocating gas.The psychological trauma was also profound, as communities watched family, friends, and neighbors die silently in the night. The disaster devastated local livelihoods, as the loss of livestock and crops left entire villages struggling to recover.Immediate scientific response and long-term degassing efforts: Preventing future disastersThe scale and suddenness of the Lake Nyos disaster prompted urgent scientific study to understand and mitigate future risks. Researchers discovered that CO2 could build up in other deep, stratified volcanic lakes, and preventive measures were urgently needed. In 2001, a permanent degassing system was installed in Lake Nyos.The system involves a pipe inserted into the lake’s deep waters to slowly release CO2 in a controlled manner. Initially, pumps were used to start the process, but as the gas began to escape, it created a self-sustaining flow that continues without external power. Two additional pipes were installed in 2011 to increase safety, and by 2019 scientists confirmed that even a single pipe could maintain safe CO2 levels indefinitely.These measures have drastically reduced the risk of another sudden eruption, ensuring the lake is monitored continuously and that surrounding communities are better protected.Lessons and global significance: How Lake Nyos changed our understanding of natural hazardsLake Nyos is one of only two recorded limnic eruptions in history, the other being Lake Monoun in Cameroon in 1984. These events have shown that certain volcanic lakes, particularly in the East African Rift region, can store large amounts of CO2 over decades, creating a hidden threat that can be triggered suddenly. The Lake Nyos tragedy sparked global scientific interest in understanding such lakes and implementing early-warning systems. Research extended to other African lakes, including Lake Kivu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is far larger and similarly gas-saturated. Although subsequent studies have revised risk levels for Lake Kivu, the Nyos disaster remains a key example of the lethal potential of limnic eruptions. Beyond science, the tragedy highlights the importance of disaster preparedness, community awareness, and international support for vulnerable populations living near high-risk natural sites.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The Ministry of Education has optimized weekly class schedules across grade levels and launched a nationwide AI curriculum. This initiative aims to modernize learning, enhance student well-being, and cultivate digital skills in line with Vision 2030. Ministry of Education has confirmed the start dates for the upcoming 2025–2026 academic year/Representative Image Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Education has confirmed the start dates for the upcoming 2025–2026 academic year, along with new weekly class schedules across all grade levels and the introduction of a nationwide Artificial Intelligence (AI) curriculum. These changes reflect a careful balance between improving academic delivery, supporting student well-being, and preparing future generations for a technology-driven world in line with Vision 2030.TL;DR:Most Saudi regions will begin school on August 24, 2025; schools in Makkah, Madinah, Jeddah, and Taif will start officially on August 31.The Ministry has released grade-wise weekly class/subject structures to optimize learning while supporting student wellbeing.All grades will experience hands-on, progressive AI modules, starting 2025–2026, to build national digital and analytical skills.Academic year start dates & staggered returnIn most regions, administrative staff and education supervisors resumed work on August 12, 2025, while teachers returned on August 17, with student classes starting on August 24. In high-density education hubs such as Makkah, Madinah, Jeddah, and Taif, the schedule is offset by one week: staff report on August 17, teachers on August 24, and students begin on August 31. This staggered approach aims to allow better coordination, facility readiness, and smoother student transitions in the busiest school zones.Weekly class structure by gradeThe Ministry’s updated timetable allocates 33 weekly periods (each period roughly 45 minutes) for Grades 1 to 6, with younger students covering eight subjects plus activity classes, and older elementary pupils covering ten subjects. Intermediate school students in Grades 7 and 8 have 35 periods with ten subjects, while Grade 9 students also have 35 periods but with an additional non-academic development component. Secondary school students under the General Track System have 32 periods per week, with subjects varying by semester and grade to accommodate advanced specialization while maintaining core learning standards. This shift is designed to sustain rigorous academics while creating room for sports, arts, and other student development programs.AI curriculum rollout: Building future skillsFor the first time in Saudi Arabia’s public education system, students in all grades will be taught artificial intelligence through age-appropriate, practical lessons. Developed in partnership between the National Curriculum Center, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, and the Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA), this program introduces AI concepts step-by-step, linking them to real-life applications. Hands-on projects encourage problem-solving, critical thinking, and creativity, while preparing students to participate in emerging technology sectors. The new curriculum builds on the success of previous high school AI pilots and directly supports Vision 2030’s Human Capability Development Program, aiming to position the Kingdom as a regional leader in digital talent.The 2025–2026 academic year marks a significant milestone for Saudi Arabia’s education system. With region-specific school start dates, an optimized class schedule, and the groundbreaking introduction of AI education from primary to secondary levels, these reforms are designed to modernize learning, promote student well-being, and equip young Saudis with the knowledge and skills to thrive in a rapidly changing, tech-driven global economy.FAQ1. When will the 2025–2026 school year start in Saudi Arabia?Most regions start on August 24, 2025, while Makkah, Madinah, Jeddah, and Taif begin on August 31, 2025.2. Why do some cities have later start dates?The staggered schedule eases logistical challenges and prepares facilities in high-density areas.3. What changes have been made to the weekly class schedule?Weekly periods are set at 33 for elementary, 35 for intermediate, and 32 for secondary students, with subjects adjusted by grade.4. What’s new about the curriculum this year?All grades will have age-appropriate AI lessons developed with SDAIA and other partners.5. How does this change support Vision 2030?By teaching AI and digital skills from early grades, it builds a future-ready workforce and strengthens Saudi Arabia’s tech leadership.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Coastal regions face sudden land subsidence and massive waves, posing unprecedented risks to millions. Researchers urge immediate action for improved early-warning systems and resilient infrastructure to minimize potential devastation. Representative image Scientists are warning of a potentially catastrophic mega-tsunami that could strike parts of the US Pacific Coast, triggered by a major earthquake along the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ). Stretching roughly 600 miles from Northern California to Vancouver Island, this fault line accumulates massive tectonic stress as the Juan de Fuca Plate slides beneath the North American Plate. Researchers from Virginia Tech, led by geoscientist Tina Dura, estimate there is a 15% chance of a magnitude 8.0 or greater earthquake occurring along the CSZ within the next 50 years.According to their study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, such an event could suddenly sink coastal land by up to 6.5 feet, dramatically expanding floodplains and generating tsunami waves hundreds of feet high, posing unprecedented risks to millions of residents, critical infrastructure, and ecosystems along the West Coast.US Tsunami: Waves Top 3 Feet, Northern California Still On Alert; Tourists ‘Flee’ Hawaii | WatchTsunami threat along the Cascadia Subduction ZoneThe Cascadia Subduction Zone is one of North America’s most hazardous fault lines, according to the Virginia Tech research team. Over centuries, tectonic stress builds as the oceanic Juan de Fuca Plate is forced beneath the North American Plate. When this stress is released during a major earthquake, coastal regions could experience sudden land subsidence, dramatically increasing floodplain areas and altering shorelines almost instantly. The last great earthquake along this fault occurred in 1700, triggering a tsunami recorded as far away as Japan. The Virginia Tech study emphasizes that a similar event today would have far more devastating effects due to dense populations, developed urban infrastructure, and critical transportation networks along the coast. Researchers warn that rapid inundation could leave little time for evacuation, magnifying the human and economic toll.The potential mega-tsunami threatAccording to simulations conducted by Dura and her team, a major CSZ earthquake could generate a “mega-tsunami” with waves potentially reaching up to 1,000 feet, far surpassing typical tsunami heights of only a few feet. Coastal cities including Seattle, Portland, and towns in northern California could be submerged within minutes. The Virginia Tech study ran tens of thousands of models, showing that thousands more people, buildings, and miles of roads would be exposed to flooding than current hazard maps predict. Researchers emphasize that such an event would combine sudden ground subsidence with extreme wave heights, creating conditions unlike any historical tsunami in the region. The study highlights the urgent need for improved early-warning systems, evacuation planning, and resilient infrastructure to minimize potential loss of life.Areas at highest risk of tsunamiThe Virginia Tech research identifies southern Washington, northern Oregon, and northern California as the regions most vulnerable to flooding from a CSZ mega-tsunami. While Alaska and Hawaii also face tsunami risks due to their own seismic activity, they are geographically farther from the CSZ and would experience less immediate threat. Low-lying coastal zones along the fault line could face permanent inundation, particularly when combined with climate-driven sea level rise projected by 2100. The study underscores that communities must prioritize flood-resilient urban planning, fortification of critical infrastructure, and preparation for long-term displacement scenarios. Emergency planners are advised to use the study’s simulations to guide evacuation routes, reinforce hospitals and shelters, and prepare for cascading impacts to energy, water, and transportation systems.Urgency of preparedness for tsunami and earthquakeLead researcher Tina Dura emphasizes that a mega-tsunami triggered by a CSZ earthquake would be sudden and catastrophic, not a gradual environmental change. The study warns that without proactive disaster planning, evacuation protocols, and resilient construction, a major quake could result in more than 30,000 deaths, damage over 170,000 structures, and incur economic losses exceeding $81 billion. Researchers highlight that combining earthquake and tsunami hazards with projected climate-driven sea level rise makes this a “compound disaster” scenario that demands immediate attention. According to Dura, local governments, policymakers, and coastal residents must act swiftly to implement early-warning systems, strengthen building codes, and conduct community-wide preparedness drills. The Virginia Tech study serves as a critical wake-up call, emphasizing that preparation today could dramatically reduce the human and economic costs of a future mega-tsunami.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Daley reportedly left voicemails celebrating Thompson's death and threatening his family, expressing anger over corporate greed. He was arrested, released under GPS monitoring, and could face a five-year prison sentence if convicted. . A New York man has been charged with cyberstalking a family member of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, accused of leaving threatening voicemails, just hours after Thompson was fatally shot on a Manhattan sidewalk in December. The suspect, Shane Daley, 40, was arrested on Wednesday for reportedly making multiple phone calls to Thompson’s family member in the days following the shooting, leaving messages claiming the killing was justified and Thompson’s family member and children also deserve to die in the same way, reported CBS News.According to a criminal complaint filed in Albany federal court, the suspect left profanity-laced voicemails calling Thompson a “f****** capitalist pig” and claiming he was killed for “profiting off the backs of poor Americans,” as per CNBC.Daley, from Galway, New York, a small town north of Albany, was arrested on account of cyberstalking, made his initial court appearance on Wednesday. He was released under GPS monitoring and is due back in court Thursday afternoon, according to a spokesperson for the US attorney’s office in Albany.Daley’s attorney, Samuel Breslin, said that the allegations are under review.If found guilty, he can face a maximum sentence of five years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000, and up to three years of supervised release."Brian Thompson was gunned down in midtown Manhattan. Daley, as alleged, gleefully welcomed this tragedy and did all that he could to increase the Thompson family's pain and suffering,” stated acting US attorney John A. Sarcone, as cited by CBS News.Daley’s calls were “more than callous and cold-hearted,” said Christopher Raia, the FBI’s New York assistant director in charge. “They were threatening and terrified a family already suffering following the violent death of their loved one,” Raia said, reported CNBC. Thompson, 50, was fatally shot outside the New York Hilton Midtown hotel on December 4, in what the police described as a targeted attack. The suspect, Luigi Mangione, was taken into custody in Pennsylvania after an extensive nationwide manhunt. Prosecutors said he was motivated by anger over perceived corporate greed. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to both state and federal charges.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Federal officers and National Guard troops have been deployed across key areas, leading to increased patrols and arrests. Department of Homeland Security Investigations agents join Washington Metropolitan Police Department officers as they conduct traffic checks at a checkpoint along 14th Street in northwest Washington (AP photo) Residents in parts of Washington DC took to the streets Wednesday to protest President Donald Trump’s takeover of the city’s police department and the surge of federal officers and National Guard troops. The demonstrations, marked by chants and calls for drivers to avoid police checkpoints, came as the White House defended the month-long federal control as necessary to combat crime, despite city data showing violent crime at a decades-low, reported AP.Residents rally against 24/7 presence of federal agentsLaw enforcement set up a vehicle checkpoint along the busy 14th Street Northwest corridor, prompting hecklers to shout, “Go home, fascists” and “Get off our streets.” Some protesters stood before the checkpoint urging drivers to turn away.The protests followed Trump’s unprecedented announcement that his administration would take over the Metropolitan Police Department for at least a month. The city’s Democratic mayor described the move as an “authoritarian push” before later calling it a public safety measure with no clear benchmarks for success. Trump has argued that crime in the city is at “emergency levels,” while local leaders point to statistics showing violent crime at a 30-year low after a sharp rise two years ago.Troops and federal agents patrol key areasFederal officers and National Guard troops were deployed to more high-profile areas Wednesday, with plans for expanded missions on Thursday (local time), according to a National Guard spokesman. Homeland Security Investigations agents patrolled the U Street corridor, Drug Enforcement Administration officers were seen on the National Mall, and FBI agents were stationed along Massachusetts Avenue. DEA agents also joined city police in the Navy Yard neighborhood, while National Guard members were parked nearby.1,450 federal and local officers, on Tuesday night, patrolled the city, making 43 arrests, compared with about two dozen the night before. Councilmember Christina Henderson dismissed the arrest count as “a bunch of traffic stops” and said the administration was trying to disguise how unnecessary the intervention was. “I'm looking at this list of arrests and they sound like a normal Saturday night in any big city,” she said.Trump defends move, signals possible extensionFederal law allows the president to control Washington’s police for up to 30 days without congressional approval. Trump suggested he could seek more time or ask Congress for authority to alter city laws. “We’re gonna do this very quickly. But we’re gonna want extensions. I don’t want to call a national emergency. If I have to, I will,” he said.Later, on Truth Social, he wrote, “DC has been under siege from thugs and killers, but now, DC is back under Federal Control where it belongs.”White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said, “President Trump is delivering on his campaign promise to clean up this city and restore American Greatness to our cherished capital.”The plan also includes clearing homeless encampments. US Park Police have removed dozens of tents since March and plan to dismantle more this week. People are offered shelter and addiction treatment, but those who refuse could be fined or jailed, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.City leaders seek clarity amid crime dropPolice Chief Pamela Smith said the Metropolitan Police Department is down nearly 800 officers and that federal reinforcements would help fill the gap. Mayor Muriel Bowser said officials were not given specific goals for the surge during a meeting with Attorney General Pam Bondi and other federal officials but shared the aim of increasing presence and removing guns from the streets. She previously called Trump’s move “unsettling and unprecedented,” while noting it was within his legal rights regarding the district.Some residents say the increased force is unnerving. “I’ve seen them right here at the subway ... they had my street where I live at blocked off yesterday, actually,” Washington native Sheina Taylor said, quoted by AP. “It’s more fearful now because even though you’re a law-abiding citizen, here in D.C., you don’t know, especially because I’m African American.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Did Taliban divert international aid? US watchdog blames Afghanistan rulers of using force; blocking assistance to minorities
A US watchdog report reveals the Taliban's alleged diversion of international aid in Afghanistan, using coercion and potentially collaborating with UN officials for kickbacks. The report suggests aid is being channeled to favored communities, with allegations of extortion and control over humanitarian operations. These findings raise serious concerns about the transparency and effectiveness of aid distribution in the country.

The report suggests aid is being channeled to favored communities, with allegations of extortion and control over humanitarian operations. These findings raise serious concerns about the transparency and effectiveness of aid distribution in the country. ANI file photo  Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities are reportedly diverting international aid through coercion and other methods, denying assistance to minority communities, and may be working with UN officials to solicit kickbacks, a US watchdog reported on Tuesday. The findings, from the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), are based on accounts from nearly 90 current and former US and UN officials, as well as other sources.India Abstains UN Vote on Afghanistan, Slams ‘Business as Usual’ Approach to Terrorism, Taliban"In Afghanistan, SIGAR found that the Taliban use every means at their disposal, including force, to ensure that aid goes where they want it to go, as opposed to where donors intend," the report said, as per Reuters. SIGAR reported that an Afghan aid worker who contributed to the report was killed after revealing that food aid was diverted to a Taliban military training camp, but it could not confirm who was behind the killing, as per Reuters. Taliban spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat rejected the allegations, saying that government agencies work together to “ensure transparency” and prevent any diversion, noting that aid in Afghanistan is distributed independently.The report claimed that the Taliban makes use of force and other regulatory measures to exert control over aid flow in the country. They also reportedly decide which humanitarian groups are allowed to operate, channeling US-funded assistance to the favored majority Pashtun communities over minority groups, and extorting humanitarian workers.Interviewees alleged that UN officials solicited bribes from companies and aid groups in exchange for contracts, and that Taliban officials allegedly "collude with UN officials to extort bribes from UN contractors and then split the proceeds," said the report, as per Reuters. Between August 2021, when the Taliban seized power, and April 2025, when the Trump administration cut most US assistance, international donors contributed $10.72 billion in aid to Afghanistan, including $3.83 billion from the United States, the report said.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Wildfire in Greece (AP photo) Wildfires intensified across southern Europe on Wednesday, killing at least three people and forcing thousands to evacuate homes in Greece, Spain, Turkey and Albania. In Greece, firefighters worked through the night to protect the port city of Patras, the country’s third-largest city. Flames swept through pine forests and olive groves, burning houses, agricultural sites and dozens of vehicles. The fire service said the risk of more fires remained “very high” in several regions. At least 15 firefighters were injured or treated for burns, smoke inhalation and exhaustion. Residents joined the firefighting effort, using buckets of water and tree branches to beat down flames. Aircraft dropped water over the affected areas. Weeks of heatwaves have stretched firefighting resources across Greece and its neighbours. On the Greek island of Chios, exhausted firefighters were seen sleeping on the roadside after overnight shifts. In Albania, an 80-year-old man died in a fire south of Tirana. Villages in central Albania were evacuated, and explosions were reported in the Korca district due to buried World War II-era shells. Dozens of homes were destroyed.Wildfires rage across southern Europe | BBC News In Spain, a firefighting volunteer died in the Castile and Leon region, where thousands have been displaced. Some evacuees spent the night outdoors. Fires disrupted high-speed rail services between Madrid and Galicia. In Turkey, a forestry worker was killed and four others were injured when a fire truck crashed while responding to a blaze. Turkey has been battling wildfires since late June, with 18 deaths reported so far. France which is recovering from massive recent fires in the southern regions, faced another day of extreme heat, with temperatures reaching 42°C. Authorities restricted public events in high-risk areas. Officials across the region cited lightning storms, farming activities, faulty power lines and arson as possible causes. The European Union has sent ground teams and aircraft to help, including in Montenegro, where large fires continue to burn near the capital, Podgorica.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Canada wildfires (AP photo) Almost 20,000 people in western Canada were on standby on Wednesday as a wildfire swept across Mount Underwood, overlooking the city of Port Alberni. Authorities say the blaze is “out of control” and could spread further. Wildfires are also threatening other parts of the country. In Newfoundland and Labrador, parts of the capital St. John’s were ordered to evacuate on Tuesday after fires intensified. In Nova Scotia, a blaze was burning on the outskirts of Halifax, home to nearly half a million people.Heatwave fuels wildfire crisis across seven provinces | CTV National News at 11 for August 12, 2025As of Wednesday, more than 700 wildfires were burning across Canada, including 161 out of control. Smoke has triggered air quality alerts for tens of millions in Canada and the US, and has travelled across the Atlantic, reaching parts of western Europe. This year is already Canada’s second-worst wildfire season since records began in 1983, with 7.4 million hectares burned, an area nearly as large as Panama. The worst was in 2023, when 17.3 million hectares were destroyed. Experts say climate change is increasing the risk of fires, with higher temperatures, reduced snow, shorter winters, and earlier summers. Fires along the coast, once rare, are now being reported more often.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

He announced federal control over the Metropolitan Police Department, deploying the National Guard to restore order. Trump vowed to liberate the city from thugs and killers, aiming to make it safe, clean, habitable, and beautiful once more. Donald Trump (AP file photo) US president Donald Trump on Wednesday said that Washington’s crime rate was among the highest in the world. He claimed DC’s homicide rate was worse than in cities like Mexico City, Bogota, Islamabad and Addis Ababa, and almost ten times higher than Fallujah in Iraq. Posting on Truth Social, the US president wrote, “If DC were a state, it would have the highest homicide rate of any state in America. The violent crime rate in DC has worsened, and the murder rate has essentially doubled in just over a decade. He also alleged manipulation of crime data. "But these are only the ‘official’ statistics released by corrupt city officials. The real numbers are many times worse. In fact, a precinct commander was just suspended for allegedly manipulating the violent crime statistics, and the DC police union likewise says the real numbers are much higher,” Trump wrote.. He further alleged that the Democrat government of DC had “largely stopped investigating, arresting and prosecuting most crime,” adding that no one was arrested for shoplifting. Trump said DC residents were living in fear and had largely given up on calling the police, instead avoiding the streets after dark. He added, “DC has been under siege from thugs and killers, but now DC is back under federal control where it belongs. The White House is in charge. The military and our great police will liberate this city, scrape away the filth, and make it safe, clean, habitable and beautiful once more!” Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Trump announced that the Metropolitan Police Department would now be under federal authority, with the National Guard deployed to restore order. He said the aim was to make the capital “safe, clean, habitable and beautiful” again.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

One person sustained life-threatening injuries, and two others were critically injured. The bus veered off the road for unknown reasons, prompting an investigation by the Texas Department of Public Safety. AP file photo  A school bus with over 40 children and one adult aboard overturned in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday, the first day of the new school year, injuring 12, as per officials, reported ABC News.The bus was transporting students from Leander Independent School District in northwest Austin, located in Travis County. Out of the 12 people taken to a local hospital from the scene, one person suffered life-threatening injuries and two others were critically injured, Austin-Travis County authorities reported at a Wednesday evening press conference.The rest, who suffered non-life-threatening injuries, were brought to a reunification center for evaluation and to be reunited with their families.The rollover happened after school but before any students were dropped off, as per Bruce Gearing, the superintendent of the Leander Independent School District, reported NBC News.The driver was an experienced veteran and noted that the bus mainly serves students from a local elementary school, Gearing said. He added that it remains unclear how many students were wearing seatbelts at the time of the rollover.“This part of our Leander ISD family has been through so much already this summer with the floods and this tragedy this afternoon is really breaking our hearts,” said Gearing, reported NBC News. “We want each of those students and their families to know that our prayers are with them, our thoughts are with them, and we will do everything that we can in our power to support them,” he added. It is still unclear why the 2024 model bus equipped with seatbelts veered off the right side of the road before overturning, as per an official from the Texas Department of Public Safety. The official pointed out a slight curve in the roadway and said a preliminary investigation is underway.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Trump demands Biden retract his statements, issue an apology, and remove the content. Her attorney asserts Biden's claims are false, disparaging, and widely circulated, threatening legal action if he doesn't comply. Melania Trump, Hunter Biden (AP) US First Lady Melania Trump has issued a $1 billion legal notice to Hunter Biden, alleging that he made "false, defamatory, disparaging, and inflammatory statements" about her regarding her connections with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. She is demanding that he remove the content, retract his statements, and issue a formal apology, warning of potential legal action if he fails to comply, reported Fox News.Alejandro Brito, the attorney serving as litigation counsel for the first lady, called on Biden to "immediately retract the false, defamatory, disparaging and inflammatory statements made about Mrs. Trump," referring to remarks made in a video interview with Channel 5’s Andrew Callaghan that was posted on YouTube early August.In the video interview titled “Hunter Biden Returns,” Biden, the former first son, claims, "Epstein introduced Melania to Trump. The connections are, like, so wide and deep.""Jeffrey Epstein introduced Melania, and that’s how Melania and the first lady and the President met,” Biden said.Brito described the statements as highly obscene and widely circulated across platforms, noting that the video has been republished by numerous media outlets, journalists, and political commentators with massive followings."These false, disparaging, defamatory, and inflammatory statements are extremely salacious and have been widely disseminated throughout various digital mediums," wrote Brito in a letter addressed to Biden and his attorney Abbe Lowell, as reported by Fox News. "Indeed, the video has since been re-published by various media outlets, journalists, and political commentators with millions of social media followers that have disseminated the false and defamatory statements therein to tens of millions of people worldwide."Brito asserted that Biden’s “source” for the false claims was “serial fabulist Michael Wolff,” whose allegations appeared in a Daily Beast article titled “Melania Trump ‘Very Involved’ in Epstein Scandal: Author.”"Given your vast history of trading on the names of others, including your surname, for your personal benefit, it is obvious that you published these false and defamatory statements about Mrs. Trump to draw attention to yourself," Brito added. Brito urged Biden to issue a prominent retraction of the video and all other false or damaging statements about Trump noting that if he does not comply with the demands, “Mrs. Trump will be left with no alternative but to enforce her legal and equitable rights, all of which are expressly reserved and are not waived, including by filing legal action for over $1 Billion Dollars in damages." "You are on notice,” Brito added. Biden failed to meet the deadline to comply with the requests, as per a source familiar with the situation, reported Fox News.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Fears of a second Yalta summit loom as President Trump prepares to meet President Putin, raising concerns among Ukrainians and Europeans about potential land swaps and the redrawing of borders without their representation.

The original Yalta conference, where superpowers divided Europe, serves as a stark reminder of nations' fates being decided by others. 123 The world's superpowers met in 1945 in the Black Sea port of Yalta to divide up Europe after the defeat of Nazi Germany. They drew lines on the map that tore apart countries, effectively delivered Eastern Europe to Soviet occupation and dismembered Poland. And none of those countries were represented. As President Trump prepares to meet President Putin on Friday in Alaska, there is more talk - and anxiety - among Ukrainians and Europeans about a second Yalta. They are not scheduled to be present, and Trump has said he plans to negotiate "land swaps" with Putin over Ukrainian territory. "Yalta is a symbol of everything we fear," said Peter Schneider, who wrote "The Wall Jumper," about the division of Berlin. At Yalta, the world was divided and "countries were handed to Stalin," he said.Yalta, itself in Russian-annexed Crimea, is a symbol for how superpowers can decide the fates of other nations. "It's a linchpin moment, when the European world is divided in two and the fate of Europeans in the East is locked in without any possible say," said Ivan Vejvoda, a Serb political scientist with the Institute for Human Sciences, a research institution in Vienna. "Today's world is different, but decisions are being made on behalf of third countries for whom this is an existential issue," Vejvoda said.Putin's stated aims do not end with Ukraine. As a revisionist, he wants a new "security architecture" in Europe that recognizes the old Soviet sphere of influence.The Yalta meeting of the UK, the Soviet Union and the US, took place in Feb 1945, after France and Belgium had been liberated and the defeat of Germany was inevitable. The summit was followed by a conference in Germany which reconfirmed the division of Europe into Western and Soviet spheres.Franklin D Roosevelt and Winston Churchill were both ailing. Many believed that the two men had been taken in by the promises of Joseph Stalin that he would allow free elections in the countries occupied by the Red Army. "Yalta has gone down in history as many things, but it became a dirty word in Eastern Europe," since a main topic of the conference was its new borders, said Serhii Plokhii, a professor of Ukrainian history at Harvard.Charles de Gaulle, who led the Free French Forces during the World War II, was also not invited to Yalta, Plokhii noted. "Here we see clear parallels between de Gaulle and Europe and Poland and Ukraine," he said. Of course, there are clear differences, Plokhii said. Stalin was troublesome but an ally, who had been instrumental in defeating the Nazis. Roosevelt and Churchill were doing what they could "to better the situation for the territories already occupied by the Red Army." They were not giving up territories the allies held, as Stalin wanted, he said.Today, Plokhii said, Putin wants Ukraine to hand over territories not occupied by Russia. So that also raises another controversial moment in history, at Munich in 1938, when Neville Chamberlain agreed with Adolf Hitler to dismantle Czechoslovakia, which was not represented at those talks, in a doomed effort to keep peace.Putin's demand for unconquered Ukrainian territory is similar to Hitler's demand for the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia in 1938, Timothy Snyder, a historian of the Cold War, said. "If Ukraine is forced to concede the rest of the Donbas, it would concede defensive lines, which is what Czechs had to do," he said. "Hitler's aim was to destroy Czechoslovakia," Snyder said, "and Putin's goal is to destroy Ukraine."

Despite stepping back from politics, Trump wants his daughter, Ivanka, to be involved in the planning and organization of the event. Ivanka's potential participation would mark her return to public events after a three-year break. Ivanka Trump with her father, Donald Trump (Instagram: ivankatrump)  President Donald Trump reportedly wants his daughter, Ivanka Trump, to participate in planning and organizing an Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) cage fight on the White House lawn to commemorate America’s 250th Independence anniversary next year. This comes despite her having stepped back from politics.Since Trump’s reelection for a second term last November, Ivanka has largely stayed out of the public spotlight. However, UFC CEO Dana White said the president wants her involved in the plans for the White House event.“When [Trump] called me and asked me to do it, he said, ‘I want Ivanka in the middle of this,’” White told CBS Mornings. “So Ivanka reached out to me, and her and I started talking about the possibilities, where it would be and, you know, I put together all the renderings.”Ivanka has attended multiple UFC events with her father, as reported by the Independent.White’s relationship with Trump dates back to the early 2000s, when the president hosted some of the first UFC events at his properties. White confirmed that discussions with Trump took place Monday night, and the fight is scheduled for July 4, 2026.Trump, who has attended several UFC events, said the occasion would be one of many celebrations marking the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.Ivanka’s potential involvement would mark her return to public events after a three-year break, during which she has focused on her children and husband, Jared Kushner. In 2022, she stated, “I love my father very much. This time around, I am choosing to prioritize my young children and the private life we are creating as a family. I do not plan to be involved in politics.”Both Ivanka and Kushner played central roles in Trump’s 2016 campaign and served as presidential advisors beginning in 2017. Following the contentious 2020 election and the Capitol Hill riots, Ivanka chose not to participate in her father’s second presidential run.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Gardaí confirmed they are investigating the assault and his injuries are “non-life threatening”.An Indian-origin woman has put a post on Reddit saying her 60-year-old father was harassed by boys, aged around seven and eight, who tried to take his wallet at a bus stop in Dublin on Aug 9.These are just the latest in a string of racist attacks targeting Indians in Ireland which have left the Indian community terrified to step outside.India Day in Ireland, which celebrates the country’s cultural ties, has been postponed this Sunday owing to the wave of hate crimes. The event has been organised by the Ireland India Council since 2015. A Ficci India Day event is going ahead in Dublin on Aug 17.Indian community leaders met Ireland deputy PM Simon Harris on Monday after which he condemned the “despicable acts of violence and racism”.Chairman of the Ireland India Council Prashant Shukla told Ireland AM: “We weren’t worried about the event itself as the Gardaí assured us about safety, but we were worried about the perception it could lead to further attacks. Our message to the Irish community is that these attacks are attacks on your economy and industry. Policing needs to go to the next level. I feel there are not proper investigations and arrests. We are all working, paying taxes and contributing to the economy. No one is getting a free house. People are spreading misinformation that Indians buying houses is causing house prices to go up.”President of Ireland Michael D Higgins on Tuesday also condemned the attacks. “A lot of Indians are reconsidering their choices and may move back to India if the situation doesn’t improve. It is mostly being caused by far-right groups encouraging teenagers to attack immigrants. Indians are the most visible immigrants here,” said Indian national Some Aditya Mandal, who has worked in Dublin for eight years.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle10 baby names that mean creativity and visionLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?Maharashtra’s UNESCO World Heritage Sites and other iconic monuments for history loversRajinikanth completes 50 years in cinema: Lesser-known facts about the ‘Coolie’ star6 lizards that prove reptiles can be adorableHow to unrot your brain: 5 effective steps to sharpen focus and boost mental clarityFrom Mullum Malarum to Kabali: Rajinikanth’s most emotional movies that fans still cherish123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

Dr Ajay Aggarwal, an Indian-origin pain medicine doctor from Houston, has agreed to pay over $2 million to resolve allegations of medical fraud against him, the US Justice Department revealed. Between 2021 and 2023, the 63-year-old doctor billed federally funded health care programs like Medicare and the Department of Labor’s Workers’ Compensation Programs for surgical implants that he never performed. Dr Aggarwal received thousands of dollars per procedure, but patients received simple devices which required no surgery. And all device placements used to take place at Aggarwal's clinic, not a hospital or surgical center. “A doctor who uses simple medical devices on his patients, yet bills Medicare for a sophisticated spinal surgery, is billing the American taxpayer, plain and simple,” said US Attorney Nicholas J Ganjei.. “The Southern District of Texas will ensure that losses to federally funded healthcare programs from fraudulent billing, like what happened here, are recouped and that wrongdoers are held accountable.”PollDoes the healthcare billing system need stricter monitoring to prevent fraud?YesNoA 2023 document of the DOJ revealed that earlier he was accused of giving unnecessary treatment to federal employees with federal workers' compensation benefits and his pharmacy Medley, which was officially owned by his wife, filed the prescriptions. An employee of Medley acted as a whistleblower and said that during his term of employment, he saw patients being sent unnecessary with unnecessary medications being prescribed. In some cases, the patients did not even see or meet Dr Aggarwal. And Medley employees were allegedly instructed to auto-fill medications on a monthly basis and to use pre-printed prescription pads to submit the prescriptions to DOL-OWCP without consideration of medical need. The new fraud of Dr Aggarwal came to be reported at a time when foreign doctors are under fire, while several Republican leaders said US needs more doctors and foreign doctors can fill the gap.

Indian-origin Dr Vinay Prasad returns to FDA weeks after exit
Dr Vinay Prasad, previously ousted from his FDA vaccine chief position due to criticism from Laura Loomer over past anti-Trump comments and drug approval decisions, has been reinstated. This unusual move suggests the influence of RFK Jr within the Trump administration despite pressure from right-wing activists. RFK Jr opposed anti-vaxxer Dr Prasad's exit and remained invested to bring him back.

This unusual move suggests the influence of RFK Jr within the Trump administration despite pressure from right-wing activists. RFK Jr opposed anti-vaxxer Dr Prasad's exit and remained invested to bring him back.  Dr Vinay Prasad is back at his FDA job weeks after exit that was prompted by right-wing activist Laura Loomer's campaigning against Prasad. Dr Vinay Prasad, the Indian-origin vaccine chief of the FDA who was forced to resign in July after far-right activist Laura Loomer led a campaign against him, has been reinstated to his job in an unusual instance. Laura Loomer pointed out the critical comments that Dr Prasad made about President Donald Trump before joining the administration, while some of his decisions to deny drug approvals also came under fire. A Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson confirmed to the New York Times that Dr Prasad is returning to the agency. “At the F.D.A.’s request, Dr. Vinay Prasad is resuming leadership of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research,” Andrew Nixon, a health department spokesman, said in a statement.The NYT report observed that Dr Prasad's rehiring suggests that the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr., and the FDA commissioner, Dr Marty Makary, remain influential enough in the Trump administration to employ someone who had previously expressed disdain for Trump and his followers.Loomer reacted to the reinstatement and called in another "egregious personnel decision". "In another egregious personnel decision under the Trump administration, it is now being reported that longtime progressive Marxist Vinay Prasad who referred to President Trump’s supporters as criminals and compared them to drug addicts after saying he stabbed a Trump voodoo doll to “curse Trump” is apparently back at FDA," Loomer wrote.RFK Jr tapped Dr Prasad in May when the previous head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation left the role. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Dr Prasad gained prominence as an outspoken critic of vaccines and mask mandate. In his short stint at the FDA since May, Dr Prasad limited the use of Covid-19 vaccines and promoted warnings about a rare side effect of the vaccines. When he resigned from his role weeks ago, a department spokesperson told the NYT: "Dr. Prasad did not want to be a distraction to the great work of the FDA in the Trump administration and has decided to return to California and spend more time with his family."Kennedy, however, opposed Prasad's departure from the role and remained invested in bringing him back. Dr Prasad was born and brought up in Ohio and Chicago to Indian immigrant parents.

An Indian-origin techie, Manasi Mishra, who graduated with a computer science degree from Purdue University, revealed in a TikTok video as she was getting ready that the only company that called her for an interview was Chipotle. Titled 'Chipotle Interview GRWM', the TikTok video went viral as she appealed 'somebody pls hire me'. In an interview with New York Times, after the video went viral, Mishra revealed that growing up near Silicon Valley, she was used to the narrative that if she learned to code, worked hard and studied computer science, she could get a six-figure starting salary. But recent graduates are finding it hard because of the spread of AI programming tools and also the recent layoffs at companies like Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft.The NYT story confirmed that Mishra did not get the burrito-making gig at Chipotle, and she finally found a sales position job at a tech company.Mishra's story and the NYT article triggered a major debate on the present job situation, layoff and how much of it should be blamed on foreign workers, AI etc. "This is why I really do feel for Gen Z. This young woman was told her whole life by every authority figure that she should study hard, do well in school, and pursue a career in tech. She went to Purdue, one of the best engineering schools in the country. She studied computer science, not gender ideology or basket weaving," one viral comment read on X. "And still she could not even get a job at Chipotle let alone in her field. She did literally everything “right” but, to what end? This situation is not sustainable. H1B and other work visas, as well as offshoring, are getting out of control and abusive. Policymakers should care about the young generation," the person wrote. Many people commented that the jobs that the Indian-origin person missed must have gone to people from India who are on H-1B.

(Photo: DailyEcho/Padharo) Ankit Vaghela, an Indian-origin restaurant owner in Southampton, was told by the police that they could not come to his 'Padharo' when he called 999 to report a break-in. The vandals broke in and fled with several bottles of expensive alcohol and cash but the police helpline asked them to email the CCTV footage of the three burglars who broke in last week.Vaghela decided to get proactive and review the footage first. He discovered his cash register without the cash, abandoned along with some smashed liquor bottles strewn on a nearby road. “It was very heartbreaking to be told that officers will be able to review the damage in three to five working days and that no forensics was available at the time,” said Vaghela.“There was glass everywhere. As a business, we can’t afford to remain closed and had to get things cleaned up and the glass fixed. We are still struggling to operate smoothly without a proper cash register, which will take time, but are determined to welcome our guests with the same level of service we are known for in the city,” he said.The Hampshire Police said they did not underestimate the July 31 case but they understood that their investigation could start without their immediate attendance at the site, as the offenders were not there. “Every deployment decision is based on informed risk assessments to make sure the most serious cases are prioritised, and officers are on scene where there is an immediate threat to life or a crime in action,” the police force said in a statement.“On this occasion, based on the initial information we were given regarding the offenders no longer being at the scene, our investigation could get underway without any immediate attendance. That investigation is progressing with lines of enquiry identified, such as CCTV, and we are in touch with the victim to provide them updates on our investigation,” added the statement, along with an appeal to the public for any information related to the burglary."It means nothing now, the damage is done. Officers were not willing to visit the restaurant," Vaghela told to local news outlets.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

TOI correspondent from London: A six-year-old Indian-origin girl and an Indian sous chef are the latest victims in the ongoing spate of racist attacks targeting Indian nationals and Indian-origin Irish people in Ireland.The girl, whose family hail from Kottayam, Kerala, was playing outside her house in Waterford City, southeast Ireland, with friends at 7.30pm on Monday evening when a gang of boys and one girl called her a “dirty Indian” and told her to “go back to India”. She was born in Ireland. Five of the gang also punched her in the face, hit her private parts with a bicycle, punched her neck and twisted her hair.Her mother moved to Ireland eight years ago from Kottayam to work as a nurse with her husband and recently became an Irish citizen.The mother said the gang was made up of boys aged 12 to 14 and a girl aged eight. She said her daughter came home in floods of tears and is now too scared to play outside. She told the Irish Mirror: “I never expected that such an incident would happen. I thought she would be safe here. Even in front of our own house she can’t play safely. I am a nurse, I am doing my best to take care of people. I do my work and I am 100% professional. I changed my citizenship, but still we are called dirty people and even my kids are not safe. We came here to fill a labour gap. We are professionals — we have all the certificates…”The mother studied BSc Nursing at University of Calicut and went to Mount Carmel Higher Secondary School in Kottayam.“Gardaí (Irish national police) responded to a report of an alleged assault in the Kilbarry area of Waterford city on the evening of Monday 4 August. Investigations are ongoing,” a Garda spokesperson told TOI.On Wednesday morning Laxman Das from Kolkata, who works as a sous chef at the Anantara The Marker Dublin hotel, was assaulted near the Hilton Hotel by three people while on his way to work. He was taken to St Vincent's University Hospital. His phone, cash and electric bike were stolen.These come following a spate of attacks against Indians in Ireland in recent weeks — on July 19, July 24, July 27, and on Aug 1 when a cab driver was assaulted.The Gardaí said they are still investigating these attacks and no one has been arrested.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning looks of Binny Sebastiantv10 baby names that mean ‘divine light’ or ‘sacred glow’Lifestyle10 Birds with the "wildest dating rituals"LifestyleRaksha Bandhan: 10 iconic lines of famous Hindi poets that capture essence of the festivalLifestyleKarishma Tanna Stuns with Style and SpiritEntertainmentFrom Moong to Chia Sprouts: How to grow your breakfast in balconyLifestyleBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Here’s how much each contestant earns dailytv10 creatures that survive in the deepest parts of the oceanLifestyleRaksha Bandhan: 10 quotes that describe the beautiful bond between brothers and sistersLifestyleHow to do step-by-step Ayurveda hair therapy at homeLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Threads of Love, Threads of Tradition: How different Indian states celebrate Raksha BandhanFrom chapatis to cake: 7 delicious ways to use overripe bananasInternational Cat Day 2025: From Persian to Bengal Cat-- 5 most beautiful and popular pet cat breeds in the world5 diseases moles on your body might indicate and should not be ignoredNot-so popular drinks that help in weightloss10 places in South Africa that aren’t to be missed in a lifetimeMemorable style outings of Princess CharlotteHow Kangana Ranaut turned fame into fearless politicsFrom ₹6 Lakh to ₹40 Lakh: A peek into Kamal Haasan’s ultra-luxe watch closetFrom Archana reacting to a hate comment to son Aaryamann revealing how he impressed girlfriend Yogita Bihani: Archana Puran Singh shares candid moments123Hot PicksGlobal Standard indexUS stocks todayIndia-US tariffIntel CEOMukesh AmbaniUS jobless dataRussia crude oilTop TrendingTom BradyDonald TrumpSouth Park EpisodeCall of DutyMalik BeasleyBattlefield 6 Beta OpensPrivate School in IndianaLuka Doncic Weight LossLinda McMahonLakers RumorsTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteUAE launches national programme to train Emiratis in space mission design and satellite engineering'PM Modi can't, shouldn't bend knee to Donald Trump': US tariffs on India draws rare bipartisan concern in US - watch'Enormous mistake': What Trump's former NSA John Bolton said on India tariffChild assault under false identity: Indian man commits suicide in US jail months after 35-year prison sentence, claim reportsLove gone wild: Indian man faces deportation for harassing UK zoo colleague for 6 months; didn’t stop even after restraining order'Before judging...': Wife of Pakistani man Salman Iftikhar who threatened Virgin Atlantic air hostess with gangrape defends outburstFriedrich Merz halts German military exports to Israel over Gaza issue; urges aid accessGround invasion in Gaza?

The arrest occurred due to possession of a fake resident card. Authorities took him into custody in Niagara Falls, New York. He faces a potential 10-year prison sentence. The arrest is part of 'Operation Take Back America'. This initiative targets illegal immigration.  An Indian national has been arrested in the United States for allegedly possessing a forged alien resident card, according to the Justice Department. Swapnil Ramesh Tejale, 34, was taken into custody following a traffic stop in Niagara Falls, New York, and now faces a federal charge that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.“On July 10, 2025, the Niagara Falls Border Patrol Station received a request from the Niagara Falls Police Department to help identify three individuals that they had encountered during a traffic stop,” said Assistant US Attorney Michael J. Smith, who is prosecuting the case. “Agents arrived at the scene and questioned the three individuals as to their citizenship. Tejale presented a Lawful Permanent Resident Card but voluntarily admitted that the card was fictitious.”Authorities later confirmed that Tejale was in the country unlawfully and did not possess any valid immigration documents. Following his arrest, agents discovered a Social Security card in his name, which was also found to be counterfeit.The case falls under “Operation Take Back America”, a Justice Department initiative aimed at tackling illegal immigration and dismantling transnational criminal organisations. The operation seeks to “repel the invasion of illegal immigration” and “protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime”, the department said.The investigation was led by the US Border Patrol Niagara Falls Station, under the direction of Patrol Agent in Charge Brady Waikal.Tejale’s arrest is part of a series of immigration enforcement actions involving Indian nationals this year. In a related incident, an Indian man from Santa Rosa, California, was sentenced in March to six months in prison for conspiracy to transport aliens for profit. Meanwhile, Manjot Singh, a 25-year-old Indian national, was recently arrested in the Seattle area for repeat offences including robbery, assault, and criminal impersonation. Singh, who entered the U.S. illegally, is currently in ICE custody pending deportation.ICE officials have said that Singh’s arrest is a warning to repeat offenders: “Those who violate US laws while in the country illegally face arrest and deportation.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Viral footage shows firefighters inspecting the scene as the family performed the ritual. (Photo: X) A housewarming ceremony involving a Hindu havan at a Texas home took an unexpected turn when local firefighters arrived at the scene, mistaking the ritual for a fire emergency.The incident was captured on video. The footage has gone viral and has fuelled an online debate over cultural awareness and fire safety. The clip was originally shared on Instagram. It shows a fire truck from the Bedford fire department pulling up outside the house as smoke from the ceremony fills the garage. Inside, an Indian family can be seen performing a traditional havan, a religious ritual involving fire, as part of their housewarming puja.The video includes on-screen text stating, "Cultural misunderstanding 101: A Hindu puja is not a fire emergency. When you're having a housewarming havan and the fire department pulls up."Shortly after the fire crew arrives, they are seen speaking with members of the family and inspecting the area. However, it remains unclear whether any formal action was taken or if any fire codes were violated during the ritual.The footage has since been widely circulated across social media platforms, with users offering differing views on the incident. Some social media users criticised the family for conducting a ritual involving fire in a residential setting, arguing it could pose safety risks. Others defended the family’s right to observe their religious customs, calling the incident a clear example of cultural misunderstanding.No official comment was immeditaely released by the Bedford fire department.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Indian-origin Mathura Sridharan was appointed as Ohio's 12th solicitor general, inviting the wrath of online trolls who questioned why a 'non-US-origin' person was not picked for the post. Sridharan's LinkedIn went viral as critics questioned her credibility -- forcing Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost to issue a clarification, or a clapback at the trolls. Dave Yost, who announced Mathura's promotion, said Mathura is wrongly being portrayed as a non-American. "A few commenters have asserted incorrectly that Mathura is not American. She is a United States citizen, married to a US citizen, and the child of naturalized US citizens," he said. "If her name or her complexion bother you, the problem is not with her or her appointment," he added."Mathura is brilliant… she won her argument at SCOTUS last year. Both the SGs she worked under (Flowers & Gaiser) recommended her. I told her when I originally hired her I needed her to argue with me. She does… All the time! Excited to promote her. She will serve Ohio well," Yost wrote.Yost's clapback also met trolling as people commented that she is not "American-American". "Is she a Christian? That’s the biggest factor that concerns me. Based on the bindi on her forehead, I worry she is not," one wrote. "Another American job… given away to foreigners," another wrote. "She's Indian. They all have a loyalty first to other Indians. horrible pick. Totally un-American. the GOP is pathetic," a third user wrote."No one with the last name 'Sridharan' fought in the US Civil War. She's not an American," another wrote.Before joining the Ohio Solicitor’s Office, Mathura clerked for Judge Steven J. Menashi of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and Judge Deborah A. Batts of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York.

Ravishankar was the chief digital officer of Air New Zealand before getting the major promotion which is the first for an Indian-origin person in the country.New Zealand Herald, Radio New Zealand, 1News said they had to disable comments as they can't allow hatred. The New Zealand Herald issued a statement in which it clarified that there were several racist comments owing to which they had to take the extreme step. "We appreciate the high level of interest in this story but cannot safely moderate it at this time," the news outlet said in a post in the comment thread."We want to foster a safe online community by reducing instances of hate, racism, abuse and misinformation. We welcome your feedback on articles but there has to be some parameters, and these are explained in our community house rules...We cannot tolerate hate. We cannot tolerate abuse towards individuals in our stories or other commenters," the company's social media policy says. Radio New Zealand had to do the same on the social media post on Ravishankar's appointment. "Under RNZ's comments policy, we will proactively disable comments on posts which may attract abusive or harmful comments or when resources are required elsewhere," a spokesperson for RNZ said. "In this instance, the comments were disabled after our monitoring found racist comments," the spokesperson said. "We want people to feel safe and respected on our community forums and will continue to proactively disable comments where necessary. We will not tolerate harmful communications."1News said it received a large number of comments on the post that announced Ravishankar's appointment and a vast majority were inappropriate. Who is Nikhil Ravishankar?Nikhil Ravishankar was born in India but brought up in New Zealand. He studied in New Zealand -- holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) from the University of Auckland. Before joining Air New Zealand, Ravishankar was Chief Digital Officer at Vector New Zealand (from 2017), and also worked as a Managing Director at Accenture across Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand, and in senior technology roles at Spark (formerly Telecom NZ).About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

After her TikTok video went viral, another ICE official offered help. Chatterjee highlights the broader issue of poor ICE communication, impacting immigrants facing detention and difficult bond policies, leading some to abandon their asylum claims. Trisha Chatterjee (Picture source: LinkedIn) Trisha Chatterjee, an Indian-origin immigration lawyer in Ohio, has alleged she was given the number of a Taco Bell outlet when she called ICE for urgent client support. Chatterjee posted about the incident on TikTok, where it went viral and ultimately led to help from another ICE official. But she says the larger issue lack of clear access to immigration authorities continues to cause serious harm to her clients."I called and they answered and they said, 'Hello, Taco Bell?' And I said, 'Taco Bell?' And the guy who was working said, 'Yeah, Taco Bell. Ma'am, you called me," Chatterjee recalled."I was in such disbelief," she said. "So, I called the ICE officer back, just really frustrated with what had just happened. He says, 'Oh, I'm sorry. I was trying to lighten the mood and make you laugh.'"ICE has denied the accusation. Homeland security called it a “lie and a smear.” Chatterjee stood by her version of events.Who is Trisha Chatterjee? Trisha Chatterjee is an Indian-origin immigration lawyer based in Greater Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio. She graduated from Miami University in 2020 and the University of Dayton School of Law in 2023.She works with the law office of Emily Feliz Garcia, a small immigration firm in Springdale. Before this, she worked at Abdallah law offices.For the last two years, she has handled immigration cases, especially those involving clients detained at the Butler County Jail in Ohio, which has a contract with ICE.Chatterjee was trying to submit "stay of removal" applications—urgent paperwork that can pause deportation for clients with pending immigration cases. ICE requires these to be submitted in person at the Detroit field office, but she hoped to file them locally in Blue Ash.After being unable to reach anyone by phone or email, she finally spoke to an ICE officer who gave her a phone number that turned out to be for Taco Bell. When she called back, the officer reportedly said he was trying to make her laugh.She posted a video about the incident on TikTok, which gained over 38,000 views. Many users sympathised, and one even helped her connect with a helpful ICE official in Blue Ash, who is now assisting her.Chatterjee said the larger problem is the lack of access and communication with ICE. She also highlighted how a stricter bond policy is making it harder for immigrants to stay out of detention during legal proceedings. Bonds can cost up to $50,000 and must be paid upfront.According to Chatterjee, some clients are abandoning their asylum cases or choosing to self-deport out of fear. She mentioned recent local arrests of people attending ICE check-ins, which has only deepened anxiety in immigrant communities.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani faces criticism for visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam due to his past support for defunding the police. Critics accuse Mamdani of shifting his stance for political gain, especially after his 2020 tweets resurfaced. Mamdani defends his actions, clarifying his current position on public safety and police funding. Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is facing backlash after visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam, as critics pointed to his past 2020 tweet supporting "defund the police" stance.The controversy erupted after Mamdani, who recently returned from a trip to Uganda, visited the grieving family of officer Islam, one of four victims killed in a mass shooting in Midtown Manhattan. Zohran Mamdani’s SECRET Wedding Triggers Fury Amid Local Tragedy | WATCHThe shooter, Shane Tamura, opened fire on Monday, killing Islam and three others before shooting himself.Sharing a post on X, Mamdani wrote: “Two days ago, an act of senseless violence took the lives of Officer Didarul Islam, Wesley LePatner, Aland Etienne, and Julia Hyman. Today, I visited Officer Islam's family and learned of his legacy. I ask you to join me in honoring the memory of these four New Yorkers.”However, the post quickly drew criticism, with users referencing Mamdani’s previous tweets during the height of the “Defund the Police” movement in 2020.Many accused him of changing his stance for political gain. One user wrote, “You can't go from defund the police to never mind I love the police. You're asking New Yorkers to forgo their guns meanwhile you just had a wedding in Uganda with armed guards.”While another posted, “Zohran Mamdani exposed as a total fraud. Mocking cops, calling them racist, then acting like he cares? No loyalty to America. He belongs in Uganda, not leading NYC. Deport him and protect our city!”Earlier at a press conference following his visit to the officer’s home in The Bronx, Mamdani addressed the criticism and attempted to clarify his position saying: “I am not defunding the police; I am not running to defund the police.”“Over the course of this race, I’ve been very clear about my view of public safety and the critical role that the police have in creating that public safety,” he added.Standing alongside members of the Bangladeshi American Police Association—of which Officer Islam was a member—and labor union 32BJ, which represented another victim, Aland Etienne, Mamdani tried to strike a unifying tone.During the peak of the "Defund the Police" movement in 2020, Zohran Mamdani repeatedly called for major cuts to the NYPD budget. In one post, he wrote, “We don’t need an investigation to know that the NYPD is racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety. What we need is to #DefundTheNYPD.”In another, he said, “There is no negotiating with an institution this wicked & corrupt. Defund it. Dismantle it. End the cycle of violence,” referencing budget talks around proposed NYPD cuts.Now, Mamdani has distanced himself from those remarks. When asked about them, he responded, “My statements in 2020 were made amidst a frustration that many New Yorkers held at the murder of George Floyd.”Mamdani claimed that his current stance is more nuanced, stating that his previous posts were “clearly out of step” with his recent campaign platform. He now supports maintaining the NYPD headcount while reducing its overtime budget.Despite this clarification, skepticism remains. Many police officers and political observers have accused Mamdani of shifting positions purely for political gain in a city where public safety remains a top concern for voters, New York Post reported.Adding to the political firestorm, former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams, who are both trailing Mamdani in early polling for the 2025 mayoral race, weighed in shortly after the shooting. Mamdani fired back, accusing Cuomo of politicising the tragedy saying, “It is beyond me that politicians are looking to use these days to score such cynical political points, on the very day that I held the father of Officer Islam in my arms and he could not utter a single word.”“For the former governor to spend an entire day speaking almost exclusively about me and barely about the New Yorkers who have been killed is indicative of the very politics New Yorkers want to leave in the past,” he added.All three, Mamdani, Cuomo, and Adams are expected to attend officer Islam’s funeral on Thursday.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The high court found him guilty of rape and outrage of modesty, following incidents at his Jurong West shop in 2021. Despite his denials and claims of erectile dysfunction, the judge deemed the victim's testimony credible.  An Indian national was sentenced to more than 14 years in jail on Thursday by the Singapore high court for sexually assaulting a minor, reports the Straits Times.Ramalingam Selvasekaran was handed a sentence of 14 years, three months and two weeks after being found guilty of rape and two counts of outrage of modesty after assaulting an 11-year-old at his provision shop in Jurong West.According to the court, the assaults occurred between 4.50 pm and 5.05 pm on October 28, 2021. The girl had visited Ramalingam’s store and returned later to buy ice cream. Prosecutors said he led her into a back area and forced her to perform oral sex. After the incident, the girl sought help from a passerby, who called the police.Ramalingam represented himself during the trial, which began on January 16. He was convicted on all charges on 7 July.“The fact that she had not run off after the first act of molest, or that she did not resist the assaults, or inform her grandfather, were all to my mind sufficiently explained, particularly given that she was still young and immature,” said Justice Aidan Xu, who found the girl’s account credible and consistent.Ramalingam’s earlier statements to police reportedly included admissions of hugging, kissing, and oral sex. However, he later denied any wrongdoing, claiming he was suffering from erectile dysfunction and that no DNA evidence was found on the victim.The judge ruled that these claims did not undermine the girl’s testimony. “While there was no dispute that Ramalingam suffered from erectile dysfunction, the prosecution’s expert witness gave a cogent explanation that oral rape remained possible,” Justice Xu was quoted as saying to Straits Times.Following sentencing on July 30, Ramalingam said he would appeal and was granted bail of S$80,000. He attempted to negotiate with the judge over the conditions, asking for the removal of his electronic tag and exemption from reporting to the Police Cantonment Complex. Both requests were denied.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

A Hindu temple in Melbourne’s eastern suburb of Boronia was defaced with racist graffiti this week prompting widespread condemnation and police investigation.As reported by The Brisbane Times and The Sydney Morning Herald, offensive red graffiti with the words “Go home” and other racial slurs were found daubed across the Shree Swaminarayan Temple on Wadhurst Drive, as well as two nearby Asian-operated restaurants Kingsland Chinese Restaurant and Charles King Dumpling.Police said a healing centre on Mountain Highway was also defaced the same night, bringing the total number of sites attacked to four. “There is absolutely no place at all in our society for hate-based and racist behaviour,” Victoria Police said in a statement. Authorities confirmed that all four incidents are being treated as linked and that an investigation is under way.PollShould harsher penalties be implemented for hate crimes?Yes, definitelyNo, current laws are sufficient'An attack on our right to worship'Makrand Bhagwat, President of the Hindu Council of Australia’s Victoria chapter, told Australia Today the vandalism of the temple was “heartbreaking” for the community. “Our temple is meant to be a sanctuary of peace, devotion and unity,” he said. “To have it targeted in this way feels like an attack on our identity, our right to worship and freedom of religion.”Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan sent a personal message of support to temple management. “What happened this week was hateful, racist and deeply disturbing,” she wrote. “It wasn’t just vandalism – it was a deliberate act of hate, designed to intimidate, isolate, and spread fear.”Local interfaith networks, including the City of Greater Knox’s Multifaith Network, have expressed support. “We want to show that love and solidarity triumph over hate,” said community leader Vikrant Thakur.Indian man targeted in racist attackThis came after a 23-year-old Indian man, Charanpreet Singh, was brutally attacked and left unconscious on a street in Adelaide following a reported racist assault linked to a parking dispute. According to 9News, the men allegedly told Singh to "f--- off, Indian" before launching a violent, unprovoked assault.“They just said ‘f--- off, Indian’, and after that they just started punching,” Singh said. “I tried to fight back, but they beat me until I was unconscious.”He sustained serious injuries, including brain trauma and facial fractures. A 20-year-old from Enfield was arrested and charged, but others involved remain at large.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Singh and his wife were allegedly ambushed by a group of men who shouted racial slurs before inflicting serious injuries. The incident has sparked outrage and renewed calls for enhanced safety measures for international students in the area.  An Indian international student has been hospitalised with serious injuries after a violent assault in Australia's Adelaide that is being investigated as a possible racially motivated attack. The incident has sparked outrage across the Indian community and renewed calls for better safety measures for international students.Charanpreet Singh, 23, was with his wife near Kintore Avenue on Saturday evening (July 19) when they were allegedly ambushed by a group of five men. According to Australia Today, the couple had just parked their car to view the city’s light displays around 9:22pm when the attackers emerged from another vehicle.Viral video shows assaultEyewitnesses and video footage shared on social media reportedly show the men striking Singh with what appeared to be metal knuckles or sharp objects, while shouting racial abuse including: “F--- off, Indian”. The attackers then fled the scene, leaving Singh unconscious and seriously injured on the road.PollWhat should be prioritized to improve safety for international students?Awareness campaigns and community supportStronger law enforcement and quicker actionSingh, who spoke to 9News from his hospital bed, said the altercation began over a car parking dispute but escalated into a racially charged assault. “They just said, ‘F--- off, Indian,’ and after that they just started punching,” he recalled. “You can change anything in your body, but you can’t change the colours.”He sustained facial fractures and brain trauma, and was taken by emergency services to the Royal Adelaide Hospital for overnight treatment. The assault has left members of the local Indian community shaken, with many expressing solidarity with Singh online.“When things like this happen, it makes you feel like you should go back,” Singh said.Police investigation under waySouth Australia Police confirmed they were called to Kintore Avenue shortly before 9.30pm and found Singh with facial injuries. “He was taken to hospital for treatment. Investigations are continuing,” a police spokesperson told The Indian Sun. One man, a 20-year-old from Enfield, has been arrested and charged with assault causing harm. The other suspects remain at large.Authorities are reviewing CCTV footage from the area and have urged witnesses to come forward. “We ask anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers,” the police said.Premier Peter Malinauskas has condemned the incident, calling it “completely unwelcome in our state”. He added, “Any time we see any evidence of any racial attack, it is just not consistent with where the majority of our community are at.”Another attack in DublinThis follows another attack targeting an Indian individual. An Indian man in his 40s was hospitalised after being brutally attacked by a group of teenage boys in a violent, racist assault in Dublin on Saturday evening. The gang falsely accused him of inappropriate behaviour with children before beating him and pulling down his trousers. “Gardaí in Tallaght were alerted to an incident at Parkhill Road... Investigations are ongoing,” police said. Councillor Baby Pereppadan said, “He couldn’t speak much because of the shock.” Sinn Féin’s Seán Crowe added, “You are sowing hate, fear, and division.” A protest is planned for July 26 to condemn rising racist violence in Ireland.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Her exit, surprising to many, opens an opportunity for the U.S. Treasury to propose a successor amidst global trade dynamic shifts. Gopinath, the first female chief economist, joined the IMF in 2019 and was promoted in 2022. Gita Gopinath (File photo) NEW DELHI: Gita Gopinath, the second-in-command at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), will step down at the end of August to return to her position at Harvard University, the IMF announced on Monday.The timing of Gita Gopinath’s exit has taken many within the IMF by surprise and is believed to have been prompted by her own decision, reported news agency Reuters. Having originally left Harvard to serve at the Fund, she is now set to resume her role as professor of economics at the university. Her departure opens a window for the US Treasury to propose a successor—an opportunity that comes as President Donald Trump pushes to reshape global trade dynamics and curb the country’s persistent trade deficits through sweeping tariffs on imports worldwide. Gopinath, who joined the IMF in 2019 as its first-ever female chief economist, was elevated to First Deputy Managing Director in January 2022. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva will appoint her successor “in due course,” the statement added.Gopinath had served as the first female chief economist of the Washington-based global lender for three years. Gopinath's research has been published in many top economics journals. Prior to her appointment as IMF Chief Economist, she was the John Zwaanstra Professor of International Studies and Economics in the economics department of Harvard University. Before joining the faculty of Harvard University in 2005, she was an assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.Gopinath, who considers herself a product of the Indian education system, she completed her schooling in Mysuru. She had her first brush with macro-economic challenges while doing her bachelor’s degree at Lady Shri Ram College, Delhi, with India experiencing its first major external financing and currency crisis in 1990-91. “This inspired me to pursue graduate work in economics and was the foundation for my interest in international finance,” she had told in an interview in 2010.Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.AI Masterclass for Students.

One of the group took his metal water bottle and hit him above the eye, causing heavy bleeding. He was taken to hospital where he received eight stitches. Gardaí confirmed they are investigating the assault and his injuries are “non-life threatening”.An Indian-origin woman has put a post on Reddit saying her 60-year-old father was harassed by boys, aged around seven and eight, who tried to take his wallet at a bus stop in Dublin on Aug 9.These are just the latest in a string of racist attacks targeting Indians in Ireland which have left the Indian community terrified to step outside.India Day in Ireland, which celebrates the country’s cultural ties, has been postponed this Sunday owing to the wave of hate crimes. The event has been organised by the Ireland India Council since 2015. A Ficci India Day event is going ahead in Dublin on Aug 17.Indian community leaders met Ireland deputy PM Simon Harris on Monday after which he condemned the “despicable acts of violence and racism”.Chairman of the Ireland India Council Prashant Shukla told Ireland AM: “We weren’t worried about the event itself as the Gardaí assured us about safety, but we were worried about the perception it could lead to further attacks. Our message to the Irish community is that these attacks are attacks on your economy and industry. Policing needs to go to the next level. I feel there are not proper investigations and arrests. We are all working, paying taxes and contributing to the economy. No one is getting a free house. People are spreading misinformation that Indians buying houses is causing house prices to go up.”President of Ireland Michael D Higgins on Tuesday also condemned the attacks. “A lot of Indians are reconsidering their choices and may move back to India if the situation doesn’t improve. It is mostly being caused by far-right groups encouraging teenagers to attack immigrants. Indians are the most visible immigrants here,” said Indian national Some Aditya Mandal, who has worked in Dublin for eight years.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle10 baby names that mean creativity and visionLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?Maharashtra’s UNESCO World Heritage Sites and other iconic monuments for history loversRajinikanth completes 50 years in cinema: Lesser-known facts about the ‘Coolie’ star6 lizards that prove reptiles can be adorableHow to unrot your brain: 5 effective steps to sharpen focus and boost mental clarityFrom Mullum Malarum to Kabali: Rajinikanth’s most emotional movies that fans still cherish123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

Dr Ajay Aggarwal, an Indian-origin pain medicine doctor from Houston, has agreed to pay over $2 million to resolve allegations of medical fraud against him, the US Justice Department revealed. Between 2021 and 2023, the 63-year-old doctor billed federally funded health care programs like Medicare and the Department of Labor’s Workers’ Compensation Programs for surgical implants that he never performed. Dr Aggarwal received thousands of dollars per procedure, but patients received simple devices which required no surgery. And all device placements used to take place at Aggarwal's clinic, not a hospital or surgical center. “A doctor who uses simple medical devices on his patients, yet bills Medicare for a sophisticated spinal surgery, is billing the American taxpayer, plain and simple,” said US Attorney Nicholas J Ganjei.. “The Southern District of Texas will ensure that losses to federally funded healthcare programs from fraudulent billing, like what happened here, are recouped and that wrongdoers are held accountable.”PollDoes the healthcare billing system need stricter monitoring to prevent fraud?YesNoA 2023 document of the DOJ revealed that earlier he was accused of giving unnecessary treatment to federal employees with federal workers' compensation benefits and his pharmacy Medley, which was officially owned by his wife, filed the prescriptions. An employee of Medley acted as a whistleblower and said that during his term of employment, he saw patients being sent unnecessary with unnecessary medications being prescribed. In some cases, the patients did not even see or meet Dr Aggarwal. And Medley employees were allegedly instructed to auto-fill medications on a monthly basis and to use pre-printed prescription pads to submit the prescriptions to DOL-OWCP without consideration of medical need. The new fraud of Dr Aggarwal came to be reported at a time when foreign doctors are under fire, while several Republican leaders said US needs more doctors and foreign doctors can fill the gap.

The OCI card can also be revoked if they are charge-sheeted for an offense that carries a potential jail term of seven years or more, according to a recent notification.  Indian-origin foreign nationals holding an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card could now lose it if they face serious criminal charges or convictions, the government has announced.In a fresh gazette notification, the ministry of home affairs said that the OCI registration will be cancelled if the holder is sentenced to imprisonment for two years or more, or is named in a charge sheet for an offence carrying a jail term of seven years or more."In exercise of the powers conferred by the clause (da) of section 7D of the Citizenship Act, 1955 (57 of 1955), the central government hereby states that an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) registration shall be liable to get cancelled when a person has been sentenced to imprisonment for term of not less than two years or has been charge-sheeted for an offence entailing punishment of imprisonment for seven years or more," the notification said, as cited by PTI.PollShould stricter rules be applied to Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) cardholders?NoYesThe OCI card allows Indian-origin foreign nationals to visit India without a visa. The scheme, introduced in August 2005, enables registration as OCI for all persons of Indian origin who were citizens of India on January 26, 1950 or later, or were eligible to become citizens on that date, except for those who are, or have been, citizens of Pakistan, Bangladesh or any other country specified by the government in the official gazette.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Indian-origin Dr Vinay Prasad returns to FDA weeks after exit
Dr Vinay Prasad, previously ousted from his FDA vaccine chief position due to criticism from Laura Loomer over past anti-Trump comments and drug approval decisions, has been reinstated. This unusual move suggests the influence of RFK Jr within the Trump administration despite pressure from right-wing activists. RFK Jr opposed anti-vaxxer Dr Prasad's exit and remained invested to bring him back.

This unusual move suggests the influence of RFK Jr within the Trump administration despite pressure from right-wing activists. RFK Jr opposed anti-vaxxer Dr Prasad's exit and remained invested to bring him back.  Dr Vinay Prasad is back at his FDA job weeks after exit that was prompted by right-wing activist Laura Loomer's campaigning against Prasad. Dr Vinay Prasad, the Indian-origin vaccine chief of the FDA who was forced to resign in July after far-right activist Laura Loomer led a campaign against him, has been reinstated to his job in an unusual instance. Laura Loomer pointed out the critical comments that Dr Prasad made about President Donald Trump before joining the administration, while some of his decisions to deny drug approvals also came under fire. A Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson confirmed to the New York Times that Dr Prasad is returning to the agency. “At the F.D.A.’s request, Dr. Vinay Prasad is resuming leadership of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research,” Andrew Nixon, a health department spokesman, said in a statement.The NYT report observed that Dr Prasad's rehiring suggests that the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr., and the FDA commissioner, Dr Marty Makary, remain influential enough in the Trump administration to employ someone who had previously expressed disdain for Trump and his followers.Loomer reacted to the reinstatement and called in another "egregious personnel decision". "In another egregious personnel decision under the Trump administration, it is now being reported that longtime progressive Marxist Vinay Prasad who referred to President Trump’s supporters as criminals and compared them to drug addicts after saying he stabbed a Trump voodoo doll to “curse Trump” is apparently back at FDA," Loomer wrote.RFK Jr tapped Dr Prasad in May when the previous head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation left the role. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Dr Prasad gained prominence as an outspoken critic of vaccines and mask mandate. In his short stint at the FDA since May, Dr Prasad limited the use of Covid-19 vaccines and promoted warnings about a rare side effect of the vaccines. When he resigned from his role weeks ago, a department spokesperson told the NYT: "Dr. Prasad did not want to be a distraction to the great work of the FDA in the Trump administration and has decided to return to California and spend more time with his family."Kennedy, however, opposed Prasad's departure from the role and remained invested in bringing him back. Dr Prasad was born and brought up in Ohio and Chicago to Indian immigrant parents.

An Indian-origin techie, Manasi Mishra, who graduated with a computer science degree from Purdue University, revealed in a TikTok video as she was getting ready that the only company that called her for an interview was Chipotle. Titled 'Chipotle Interview GRWM', the TikTok video went viral as she appealed 'somebody pls hire me'. In an interview with New York Times, after the video went viral, Mishra revealed that growing up near Silicon Valley, she was used to the narrative that if she learned to code, worked hard and studied computer science, she could get a six-figure starting salary. But recent graduates are finding it hard because of the spread of AI programming tools and also the recent layoffs at companies like Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft.The NYT story confirmed that Mishra did not get the burrito-making gig at Chipotle, and she finally found a sales position job at a tech company.Mishra's story and the NYT article triggered a major debate on the present job situation, layoff and how much of it should be blamed on foreign workers, AI etc. "This is why I really do feel for Gen Z. This young woman was told her whole life by every authority figure that she should study hard, do well in school, and pursue a career in tech. She went to Purdue, one of the best engineering schools in the country. She studied computer science, not gender ideology or basket weaving," one viral comment read on X. "And still she could not even get a job at Chipotle let alone in her field. She did literally everything “right” but, to what end? This situation is not sustainable. H1B and other work visas, as well as offshoring, are getting out of control and abusive. Policymakers should care about the young generation," the person wrote. Many people commented that the jobs that the Indian-origin person missed must have gone to people from India who are on H-1B.

(Photo: DailyEcho/Padharo) Ankit Vaghela, an Indian-origin restaurant owner in Southampton, was told by the police that they could not come to his 'Padharo' when he called 999 to report a break-in. The vandals broke in and fled with several bottles of expensive alcohol and cash but the police helpline asked them to email the CCTV footage of the three burglars who broke in last week.Vaghela decided to get proactive and review the footage first. He discovered his cash register without the cash, abandoned along with some smashed liquor bottles strewn on a nearby road. “It was very heartbreaking to be told that officers will be able to review the damage in three to five working days and that no forensics was available at the time,” said Vaghela.“There was glass everywhere. As a business, we can’t afford to remain closed and had to get things cleaned up and the glass fixed. We are still struggling to operate smoothly without a proper cash register, which will take time, but are determined to welcome our guests with the same level of service we are known for in the city,” he said.The Hampshire Police said they did not underestimate the July 31 case but they understood that their investigation could start without their immediate attendance at the site, as the offenders were not there. “Every deployment decision is based on informed risk assessments to make sure the most serious cases are prioritised, and officers are on scene where there is an immediate threat to life or a crime in action,” the police force said in a statement.“On this occasion, based on the initial information we were given regarding the offenders no longer being at the scene, our investigation could get underway without any immediate attendance. That investigation is progressing with lines of enquiry identified, such as CCTV, and we are in touch with the victim to provide them updates on our investigation,” added the statement, along with an appeal to the public for any information related to the burglary."It means nothing now, the damage is done.

In a separate incident, Laxman Das, an Indian sous chef in Dublin, was attacked and robbed while going to work. These incidents follow a series of recent assaults targeting Indians in Ireland, raising concerns about racism.  TOI correspondent from London: A six-year-old Indian-origin girl and an Indian sous chef are the latest victims in the ongoing spate of racist attacks targeting Indian nationals and Indian-origin Irish people in Ireland.The girl, whose family hail from Kottayam, Kerala, was playing outside her house in Waterford City, southeast Ireland, with friends at 7.30pm on Monday evening when a gang of boys and one girl called her a “dirty Indian” and told her to “go back to India”. She was born in Ireland. Five of the gang also punched her in the face, hit her private parts with a bicycle, punched her neck and twisted her hair.Her mother moved to Ireland eight years ago from Kottayam to work as a nurse with her husband and recently became an Irish citizen.The mother said the gang was made up of boys aged 12 to 14 and a girl aged eight. She said her daughter came home in floods of tears and is now too scared to play outside. She told the Irish Mirror: “I never expected that such an incident would happen. I thought she would be safe here. Even in front of our own house she can’t play safely. I am a nurse, I am doing my best to take care of people. I do my work and I am 100% professional. I changed my citizenship, but still we are called dirty people and even my kids are not safe. We came here to fill a labour gap. We are professionals — we have all the certificates…”The mother studied BSc Nursing at University of Calicut and went to Mount Carmel Higher Secondary School in Kottayam.“Gardaí (Irish national police) responded to a report of an alleged assault in the Kilbarry area of Waterford city on the evening of Monday 4 August. Investigations are ongoing,” a Garda spokesperson told TOI.On Wednesday morning Laxman Das from Kolkata, who works as a sous chef at the Anantara The Marker Dublin hotel, was assaulted near the Hilton Hotel by three people while on his way to work. He was taken to St Vincent's University Hospital. His phone, cash and electric bike were stolen.These come following a spate of attacks against Indians in Ireland in recent weeks — on July 19, July 24, July 27, and on Aug 1 when a cab driver was assaulted.The Gardaí said they are still investigating these attacks and no one has been arrested.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning looks of Binny Sebastiantv10 baby names that mean ‘divine light’ or ‘sacred glow’Lifestyle10 Birds with the "wildest dating rituals"LifestyleRaksha Bandhan: 10 iconic lines of famous Hindi poets that capture essence of the festivalLifestyleKarishma Tanna Stuns with Style and SpiritEntertainmentFrom Moong to Chia Sprouts: How to grow your breakfast in balconyLifestyleBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Here’s how much each contestant earns dailytv10 creatures that survive in the deepest parts of the oceanLifestyleRaksha Bandhan: 10 quotes that describe the beautiful bond between brothers and sistersLifestyleHow to do step-by-step Ayurveda hair therapy at homeLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Threads of Love, Threads of Tradition: How different Indian states celebrate Raksha BandhanFrom chapatis to cake: 7 delicious ways to use overripe bananasInternational Cat Day 2025: From Persian to Bengal Cat-- 5 most beautiful and popular pet cat breeds in the world5 diseases moles on your body might indicate and should not be ignoredNot-so popular drinks that help in weightloss10 places in South Africa that aren’t to be missed in a lifetimeMemorable style outings of Princess CharlotteHow Kangana Ranaut turned fame into fearless politicsFrom ₹6 Lakh to ₹40 Lakh: A peek into Kamal Haasan’s ultra-luxe watch closetFrom Archana reacting to a hate comment to son Aaryamann revealing how he impressed girlfriend Yogita Bihani: Archana Puran Singh shares candid moments123Hot PicksGlobal Standard indexUS stocks todayIndia-US tariffIntel CEOMukesh AmbaniUS jobless dataRussia crude oilTop TrendingTom BradyDonald TrumpSouth Park EpisodeCall of DutyMalik BeasleyBattlefield 6 Beta OpensPrivate School in IndianaLuka Doncic Weight LossLinda McMahonLakers RumorsTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteUAE launches national programme to train Emiratis in space mission design and satellite engineering'PM Modi can't, shouldn't bend knee to Donald Trump': US tariffs on India draws rare bipartisan concern in US - watch'Enormous mistake': What Trump's former NSA John Bolton said on India tariffChild assault under false identity: Indian man commits suicide in US jail months after 35-year prison sentence, claim reportsLove gone wild: Indian man faces deportation for harassing UK zoo colleague for 6 months; didn’t stop even after restraining order'Before judging...': Wife of Pakistani man Salman Iftikhar who threatened Virgin Atlantic air hostess with gangrape defends outburstFriedrich Merz halts German military exports to Israel over Gaza issue; urges aid accessGround invasion in Gaza?

The arrest occurred due to possession of a fake resident card. Authorities took him into custody in Niagara Falls, New York. He faces a potential 10-year prison sentence. The arrest is part of 'Operation Take Back America'. This initiative targets illegal immigration.  An Indian national has been arrested in the United States for allegedly possessing a forged alien resident card, according to the Justice Department. Swapnil Ramesh Tejale, 34, was taken into custody following a traffic stop in Niagara Falls, New York, and now faces a federal charge that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.“On July 10, 2025, the Niagara Falls Border Patrol Station received a request from the Niagara Falls Police Department to help identify three individuals that they had encountered during a traffic stop,” said Assistant US Attorney Michael J. Smith, who is prosecuting the case. “Agents arrived at the scene and questioned the three individuals as to their citizenship. Tejale presented a Lawful Permanent Resident Card but voluntarily admitted that the card was fictitious.”Authorities later confirmed that Tejale was in the country unlawfully and did not possess any valid immigration documents. Following his arrest, agents discovered a Social Security card in his name, which was also found to be counterfeit.The case falls under “Operation Take Back America”, a Justice Department initiative aimed at tackling illegal immigration and dismantling transnational criminal organisations. The operation seeks to “repel the invasion of illegal immigration” and “protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime”, the department said.The investigation was led by the US Border Patrol Niagara Falls Station, under the direction of Patrol Agent in Charge Brady Waikal.Tejale’s arrest is part of a series of immigration enforcement actions involving Indian nationals this year. In a related incident, an Indian man from Santa Rosa, California, was sentenced in March to six months in prison for conspiracy to transport aliens for profit. Meanwhile, Manjot Singh, a 25-year-old Indian national, was recently arrested in the Seattle area for repeat offences including robbery, assault, and criminal impersonation. Singh, who entered the U.S. illegally, is currently in ICE custody pending deportation.ICE officials have said that Singh’s arrest is a warning to repeat offenders: “Those who violate US laws while in the country illegally face arrest and deportation.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Viral footage shows firefighters inspecting the scene as the family performed the ritual. (Photo: X) A housewarming ceremony involving a Hindu havan at a Texas home took an unexpected turn when local firefighters arrived at the scene, mistaking the ritual for a fire emergency.The incident was captured on video. The footage has gone viral and has fuelled an online debate over cultural awareness and fire safety. The clip was originally shared on Instagram. It shows a fire truck from the Bedford fire department pulling up outside the house as smoke from the ceremony fills the garage. Inside, an Indian family can be seen performing a traditional havan, a religious ritual involving fire, as part of their housewarming puja.The video includes on-screen text stating, "Cultural misunderstanding 101: A Hindu puja is not a fire emergency. When you're having a housewarming havan and the fire department pulls up."Shortly after the fire crew arrives, they are seen speaking with members of the family and inspecting the area. However, it remains unclear whether any formal action was taken or if any fire codes were violated during the ritual.The footage has since been widely circulated across social media platforms, with users offering differing views on the incident. Some social media users criticised the family for conducting a ritual involving fire in a residential setting, arguing it could pose safety risks.

Indian-origin Mathura Sridharan was appointed as Ohio's 12th solicitor general, inviting the wrath of online trolls who questioned why a 'non-US-origin' person was not picked for the post. Sridharan's LinkedIn went viral as critics questioned her credibility -- forcing Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost to issue a clarification, or a clapback at the trolls. Dave Yost, who announced Mathura's promotion, said Mathura is wrongly being portrayed as a non-American. "A few commenters have asserted incorrectly that Mathura is not American. She is a United States citizen, married to a US citizen, and the child of naturalized US citizens," he said. "If her name or her complexion bother you, the problem is not with her or her appointment," he added."Mathura is brilliant… she won her argument at SCOTUS last year. Both the SGs she worked under (Flowers & Gaiser) recommended her. I told her when I originally hired her I needed her to argue with me. She does… All the time! Excited to promote her. She will serve Ohio well," Yost wrote.Yost's clapback also met trolling as people commented that she is not "American-American". "Is she a Christian? That’s the biggest factor that concerns me. Based on the bindi on her forehead, I worry she is not," one wrote. "Another American job… given away to foreigners," another wrote. "She's Indian. They all have a loyalty first to other Indians. horrible pick. Totally un-American. the GOP is pathetic," a third user wrote."No one with the last name 'Sridharan' fought in the US Civil War. She's not an American," another wrote.Before joining the Ohio Solicitor’s Office, Mathura clerked for Judge Steven J. Menashi of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and Judge Deborah A. Batts of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. She holds a Juris Doctor from New York University School of Law, a Master’s Degree in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as a Bachelor’s Degree in Economics and in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Following Nikhil Ravishankar's appointment as Air New Zealand's CEO, media outlets in New Zealand disabled social media comments due to a surge of racist remarks targeting his Indian ethnicity.

News organizations like New Zealand Herald, Radio New Zealand, and 1News cited their inability to moderate the hateful content as the reason for shutting down comments.   After Indian-origin Nikhil Ravishankar was appointed as the new chief executive of Air New Zealand, the country's media said they had to disable comments on social media as there was a barrage of racist remarks targeting Ravishankar's ethnicity. Ravishankar was the chief digital officer of Air New Zealand before getting the major promotion which is the first for an Indian-origin person in the country.New Zealand Herald, Radio New Zealand, 1News said they had to disable comments as they can't allow hatred. The New Zealand Herald issued a statement in which it clarified that there were several racist comments owing to which they had to take the extreme step. "We appreciate the high level of interest in this story but cannot safely moderate it at this time," the news outlet said in a post in the comment thread."We want to foster a safe online community by reducing instances of hate, racism, abuse and misinformation. We welcome your feedback on articles but there has to be some parameters, and these are explained in our community house rules...We cannot tolerate hate. We cannot tolerate abuse towards individuals in our stories or other commenters," the company's social media policy says. Radio New Zealand had to do the same on the social media post on Ravishankar's appointment. "Under RNZ's comments policy, we will proactively disable comments on posts which may attract abusive or harmful comments or when resources are required elsewhere," a spokesperson for RNZ said. "In this instance, the comments were disabled after our monitoring found racist comments," the spokesperson said. "We want people to feel safe and respected on our community forums and will continue to proactively disable comments where necessary. We will not tolerate harmful communications."1News said it received a large number of comments on the post that announced Ravishankar's appointment and a vast majority were inappropriate. Who is Nikhil Ravishankar?Nikhil Ravishankar was born in India but brought up in New Zealand. He studied in New Zealand -- holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) from the University of Auckland. Before joining Air New Zealand, Ravishankar was Chief Digital Officer at Vector New Zealand (from 2017), and also worked as a Managing Director at Accenture across Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand, and in senior technology roles at Spark (formerly Telecom NZ).About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

After her TikTok video went viral, another ICE official offered help. Chatterjee highlights the broader issue of poor ICE communication, impacting immigrants facing detention and difficult bond policies, leading some to abandon their asylum claims. Trisha Chatterjee (Picture source: LinkedIn) Trisha Chatterjee, an Indian-origin immigration lawyer in Ohio, has alleged she was given the number of a Taco Bell outlet when she called ICE for urgent client support. Chatterjee posted about the incident on TikTok, where it went viral and ultimately led to help from another ICE official. But she says the larger issue lack of clear access to immigration authorities continues to cause serious harm to her clients."I called and they answered and they said, 'Hello, Taco Bell?' And I said, 'Taco Bell?' And the guy who was working said, 'Yeah, Taco Bell. Ma'am, you called me," Chatterjee recalled."I was in such disbelief," she said. "So, I called the ICE officer back, just really frustrated with what had just happened. He says, 'Oh, I'm sorry. I was trying to lighten the mood and make you laugh.'"ICE has denied the accusation. Homeland security called it a “lie and a smear.” Chatterjee stood by her version of events.Who is Trisha Chatterjee? Trisha Chatterjee is an Indian-origin immigration lawyer based in Greater Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio. She graduated from Miami University in 2020 and the University of Dayton School of Law in 2023.She works with the law office of Emily Feliz Garcia, a small immigration firm in Springdale. Before this, she worked at Abdallah law offices.For the last two years, she has handled immigration cases, especially those involving clients detained at the Butler County Jail in Ohio, which has a contract with ICE.Chatterjee was trying to submit "stay of removal" applications—urgent paperwork that can pause deportation for clients with pending immigration cases. ICE requires these to be submitted in person at the Detroit field office, but she hoped to file them locally in Blue Ash.After being unable to reach anyone by phone or email, she finally spoke to an ICE officer who gave her a phone number that turned out to be for Taco Bell. When she called back, the officer reportedly said he was trying to make her laugh.She posted a video about the incident on TikTok, which gained over 38,000 views. Many users sympathised, and one even helped her connect with a helpful ICE official in Blue Ash, who is now assisting her.Chatterjee said the larger problem is the lack of access and communication with ICE. She also highlighted how a stricter bond policy is making it harder for immigrants to stay out of detention during legal proceedings. Bonds can cost up to $50,000 and must be paid upfront.According to Chatterjee, some clients are abandoning their asylum cases or choosing to self-deport out of fear. She mentioned recent local arrests of people attending ICE check-ins, which has only deepened anxiety in immigrant communities.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The alleged abuse occurred in Contra Costa County, according to the district attorney’s office.Jennifer Powell, 45, has also been charged with 24 counts in a related felony complaint. Both Bhagwagar and Powell are being held at the Martinez detention facility. Bhagwagar’s bail has been set at $15 million.The charges in both cases carry possible prison terms of 15 years to life. Bhagwagar is expected to be arraigned Wednesday in Martinez, California.“Our office stands firmly committed to protecting children and holding those who cause harm accountable,” said Contra Costa county district attorney Diana Becton in a statement. “Every child deserves to feel safe, protected and heard when an injustice like this occurs.”According to the Contra Costa county sheriff’s office, detectives had been investigating Bhagwagar since April. His arrest was made with the assistance of Homeland Security Investigations after a warrant was issued.A short video published by aviation blog View From the Wing shows officers with badges exiting the plane’s cockpit.Delta Air Lines released a statement saying it was “appalled by reports of the charges related to the arrest” and confirmed that Bhagwagar had been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation. “Delta has zero tolerance for unlawful conduct,” the airline said.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani faces criticism for visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam due to his past support for defunding the police. Critics accuse Mamdani of shifting his stance for political gain, especially after his 2020 tweets resurfaced. Mamdani defends his actions, clarifying his current position on public safety and police funding. Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is facing backlash after visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam, as critics pointed to his past 2020 tweet supporting "defund the police" stance.The controversy erupted after Mamdani, who recently returned from a trip to Uganda, visited the grieving family of officer Islam, one of four victims killed in a mass shooting in Midtown Manhattan. Zohran Mamdani’s SECRET Wedding Triggers Fury Amid Local Tragedy | WATCHThe shooter, Shane Tamura, opened fire on Monday, killing Islam and three others before shooting himself.Sharing a post on X, Mamdani wrote: “Two days ago, an act of senseless violence took the lives of Officer Didarul Islam, Wesley LePatner, Aland Etienne, and Julia Hyman. Today, I visited Officer Islam's family and learned of his legacy. I ask you to join me in honoring the memory of these four New Yorkers.”However, the post quickly drew criticism, with users referencing Mamdani’s previous tweets during the height of the “Defund the Police” movement in 2020.Many accused him of changing his stance for political gain. One user wrote, “You can't go from defund the police to never mind I love the police. You're asking New Yorkers to forgo their guns meanwhile you just had a wedding in Uganda with armed guards.”While another posted, “Zohran Mamdani exposed as a total fraud. Mocking cops, calling them racist, then acting like he cares? No loyalty to America. He belongs in Uganda, not leading NYC. Deport him and protect our city!”Earlier at a press conference following his visit to the officer’s home in The Bronx, Mamdani addressed the criticism and attempted to clarify his position saying: “I am not defunding the police; I am not running to defund the police.”“Over the course of this race, I’ve been very clear about my view of public safety and the critical role that the police have in creating that public safety,” he added.Standing alongside members of the Bangladeshi American Police Association—of which Officer Islam was a member—and labor union 32BJ, which represented another victim, Aland Etienne, Mamdani tried to strike a unifying tone.During the peak of the "Defund the Police" movement in 2020, Zohran Mamdani repeatedly called for major cuts to the NYPD budget. In one post, he wrote, “We don’t need an investigation to know that the NYPD is racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety. What we need is to #DefundTheNYPD.”In another, he said, “There is no negotiating with an institution this wicked & corrupt. Defund it. Dismantle it. End the cycle of violence,” referencing budget talks around proposed NYPD cuts.Now, Mamdani has distanced himself from those remarks. When asked about them, he responded, “My statements in 2020 were made amidst a frustration that many New Yorkers held at the murder of George Floyd.”Mamdani claimed that his current stance is more nuanced, stating that his previous posts were “clearly out of step” with his recent campaign platform. He now supports maintaining the NYPD headcount while reducing its overtime budget.Despite this clarification, skepticism remains. Many police officers and political observers have accused Mamdani of shifting positions purely for political gain in a city where public safety remains a top concern for voters, New York Post reported.Adding to the political firestorm, former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams, who are both trailing Mamdani in early polling for the 2025 mayoral race, weighed in shortly after the shooting. Mamdani fired back, accusing Cuomo of politicising the tragedy saying, “It is beyond me that politicians are looking to use these days to score such cynical political points, on the very day that I held the father of Officer Islam in my arms and he could not utter a single word.”“For the former governor to spend an entire day speaking almost exclusively about me and barely about the New Yorkers who have been killed is indicative of the very politics New Yorkers want to leave in the past,” he added.All three, Mamdani, Cuomo, and Adams are expected to attend officer Islam’s funeral on Thursday.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The high court found him guilty of rape and outrage of modesty, following incidents at his Jurong West shop in 2021. Despite his denials and claims of erectile dysfunction, the judge deemed the victim's testimony credible.  An Indian national was sentenced to more than 14 years in jail on Thursday by the Singapore high court for sexually assaulting a minor, reports the Straits Times.Ramalingam Selvasekaran was handed a sentence of 14 years, three months and two weeks after being found guilty of rape and two counts of outrage of modesty after assaulting an 11-year-old at his provision shop in Jurong West.According to the court, the assaults occurred between 4.50 pm and 5.05 pm on October 28, 2021. The girl had visited Ramalingam’s store and returned later to buy ice cream. Prosecutors said he led her into a back area and forced her to perform oral sex. After the incident, the girl sought help from a passerby, who called the police.Ramalingam represented himself during the trial, which began on January 16. He was convicted on all charges on 7 July.“The fact that she had not run off after the first act of molest, or that she did not resist the assaults, or inform her grandfather, were all to my mind sufficiently explained, particularly given that she was still young and immature,” said Justice Aidan Xu, who found the girl’s account credible and consistent.Ramalingam’s earlier statements to police reportedly included admissions of hugging, kissing, and oral sex. However, he later denied any wrongdoing, claiming he was suffering from erectile dysfunction and that no DNA evidence was found on the victim.The judge ruled that these claims did not undermine the girl’s testimony. “While there was no dispute that Ramalingam suffered from erectile dysfunction, the prosecution’s expert witness gave a cogent explanation that oral rape remained possible,” Justice Xu was quoted as saying to Straits Times.Following sentencing on July 30, Ramalingam said he would appeal and was granted bail of S$80,000. He attempted to negotiate with the judge over the conditions, asking for the removal of his electronic tag and exemption from reporting to the Police Cantonment Complex. Both requests were denied.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The incidents, condemned by authorities and community leaders, are being treated as linked. This follows a separate racist assault in Adelaide, where an Indian man was brutally attacked after being told to "f--- off, Indian."  A Hindu temple in Melbourne’s eastern suburb of Boronia was defaced with racist graffiti this week prompting widespread condemnation and police investigation.As reported by The Brisbane Times and The Sydney Morning Herald, offensive red graffiti with the words “Go home” and other racial slurs were found daubed across the Shree Swaminarayan Temple on Wadhurst Drive, as well as two nearby Asian-operated restaurants Kingsland Chinese Restaurant and Charles King Dumpling.Police said a healing centre on Mountain Highway was also defaced the same night, bringing the total number of sites attacked to four. “There is absolutely no place at all in our society for hate-based and racist behaviour,” Victoria Police said in a statement. Authorities confirmed that all four incidents are being treated as linked and that an investigation is under way.PollShould harsher penalties be implemented for hate crimes?Yes, definitelyNo, current laws are sufficient'An attack on our right to worship'Makrand Bhagwat, President of the Hindu Council of Australia’s Victoria chapter, told Australia Today the vandalism of the temple was “heartbreaking” for the community. “Our temple is meant to be a sanctuary of peace, devotion and unity,” he said. “To have it targeted in this way feels like an attack on our identity, our right to worship and freedom of religion.”Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan sent a personal message of support to temple management. “What happened this week was hateful, racist and deeply disturbing,” she wrote. “It wasn’t just vandalism – it was a deliberate act of hate, designed to intimidate, isolate, and spread fear.”Local interfaith networks, including the City of Greater Knox’s Multifaith Network, have expressed support. “We want to show that love and solidarity triumph over hate,” said community leader Vikrant Thakur.Indian man targeted in racist attackThis came after a 23-year-old Indian man, Charanpreet Singh, was brutally attacked and left unconscious on a street in Adelaide following a reported racist assault linked to a parking dispute. According to 9News, the men allegedly told Singh to "f--- off, Indian" before launching a violent, unprovoked assault.“They just said ‘f--- off, Indian’, and after that they just started punching,” Singh said. “I tried to fight back, but they beat me until I was unconscious.”He sustained serious injuries, including brain trauma and facial fractures. A 20-year-old from Enfield was arrested and charged, but others involved remain at large.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Singh and his wife were allegedly ambushed by a group of men who shouted racial slurs before inflicting serious injuries. The incident has sparked outrage and renewed calls for enhanced safety measures for international students in the area.  An Indian international student has been hospitalised with serious injuries after a violent assault in Australia's Adelaide that is being investigated as a possible racially motivated attack. The incident has sparked outrage across the Indian community and renewed calls for better safety measures for international students.Charanpreet Singh, 23, was with his wife near Kintore Avenue on Saturday evening (July 19) when they were allegedly ambushed by a group of five men. According to Australia Today, the couple had just parked their car to view the city’s light displays around 9:22pm when the attackers emerged from another vehicle.Viral video shows assaultEyewitnesses and video footage shared on social media reportedly show the men striking Singh with what appeared to be metal knuckles or sharp objects, while shouting racial abuse including: “F--- off, Indian”. The attackers then fled the scene, leaving Singh unconscious and seriously injured on the road.PollWhat should be prioritized to improve safety for international students?Awareness campaigns and community supportStronger law enforcement and quicker actionSingh, who spoke to 9News from his hospital bed, said the altercation began over a car parking dispute but escalated into a racially charged assault. “They just said, ‘F--- off, Indian,’ and after that they just started punching,” he recalled. “You can change anything in your body, but you can’t change the colours.”He sustained facial fractures and brain trauma, and was taken by emergency services to the Royal Adelaide Hospital for overnight treatment. The assault has left members of the local Indian community shaken, with many expressing solidarity with Singh online.“When things like this happen, it makes you feel like you should go back,” Singh said.Police investigation under waySouth Australia Police confirmed they were called to Kintore Avenue shortly before 9.30pm and found Singh with facial injuries. “He was taken to hospital for treatment. Investigations are continuing,” a police spokesperson told The Indian Sun. One man, a 20-year-old from Enfield, has been arrested and charged with assault causing harm. The other suspects remain at large.Authorities are reviewing CCTV footage from the area and have urged witnesses to come forward. “We ask anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers,” the police said.Premier Peter Malinauskas has condemned the incident, calling it “completely unwelcome in our state”. He added, “Any time we see any evidence of any racial attack, it is just not consistent with where the majority of our community are at.”Another attack in DublinThis follows another attack targeting an Indian individual. An Indian man in his 40s was hospitalised after being brutally attacked by a group of teenage boys in a violent, racist assault in Dublin on Saturday evening. The gang falsely accused him of inappropriate behaviour with children before beating him and pulling down his trousers. “Gardaí in Tallaght were alerted to an incident at Parkhill Road... Investigations are ongoing,” police said. Councillor Baby Pereppadan said, “He couldn’t speak much because of the shock.” Sinn Féin’s Seán Crowe added, “You are sowing hate, fear, and division.” A protest is planned for July 26 to condemn rising racist violence in Ireland.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Her exit, surprising to many, opens an opportunity for the U.S. Treasury to propose a successor amidst global trade dynamic shifts. Gopinath, the first female chief economist, joined the IMF in 2019 and was promoted in 2022. Gita Gopinath (File photo) NEW DELHI: Gita Gopinath, the second-in-command at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), will step down at the end of August to return to her position at Harvard University, the IMF announced on Monday.The timing of Gita Gopinath’s exit has taken many within the IMF by surprise and is believed to have been prompted by her own decision, reported news agency Reuters. Having originally left Harvard to serve at the Fund, she is now set to resume her role as professor of economics at the university. Her departure opens a window for the US Treasury to propose a successor—an opportunity that comes as President Donald Trump pushes to reshape global trade dynamics and curb the country’s persistent trade deficits through sweeping tariffs on imports worldwide. Gopinath, who joined the IMF in 2019 as its first-ever female chief economist, was elevated to First Deputy Managing Director in January 2022. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva will appoint her successor “in due course,” the statement added.Gopinath had served as the first female chief economist of the Washington-based global lender for three years. Gopinath's research has been published in many top economics journals.

Harris courts Republicans with events on abortion rights, border security, and small business creation, while Trump takes stances that upset some conservatives. Both aim to expand their coalitions before the election. Kamala Harris trolled for 'fake accent'Kamala Harris trolled for 'fake accent' Kamala Harris trolled for 'fake accent'Kamala Harris trolled for 'fake accent' Kamala Harris trolled for 'fake accent'1234 In a surprising turn of events, US presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are blurring party lines as they vie for votes in the final stretch of a highly competitive election.Harris has been actively courting Republican voters, hosting events focused on issues such as abortion rights, border security, and small business creation, which have featured Republican officials.The Democratic National Convention even granted speaking slots to seven Republicans last month, and outside groups are spending millions to help Harris connect with disaffected opposing party members.Simultaneously, Harris has adopted a more assertive foreign policy stance, pledging to include a Republican in her Cabinet if elected and openly discussing her gun ownership."If somebody breaks in my house they're getting shot. Sorry," Harris told Oprah Winfrey, surprising the television star with her candour. Harris' strong support for US leadership on the global stage has already earned her the backing of more than 100 Republican national security and foreign policy officials who previously served under various presidents, including Dick Cheney.Trump, on the other hand, has taken positions that have irked some conservatives. He recently called for a federal cap on credit card interest rates at 10%. He expressed support for a federal law mandating insurance companies to cover in vitro fertilization (IVF), despite opposition from social conservatives who believe embryos used in the process should be protected.Barbara Comstock, a former Republican congresswoman from Virginia who co-chaired Nikki Haley's GOP presidential campaign, now supports Harris, citing her call for an expanded child care tax credit, support for a tough bipartisan immigration bill, and a foreign policy stance in contrast to Trump's admiration for leaders like Vladimir Putin.Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii and now a top Trump ally, describes Trump's policy approach as "common sense," highlighting his support for criminal justice reform and a foreign policy philosophy that seeks to avoid US involvement in global conflicts like the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Despite the candidates' embrace of policies that appeal to the other side, their priorities still largely align with their party's traditions.Trump opposes abortion rights and plans to vote to uphold a Florida law banning abortions after six weeks, while Harris supports abortion rights as protected under Roe v. Wade, backs a ban on assault weapons, and wants to extend prescription drug cost caps to all Americans.As the election draws near, both candidates are working to expand their coalitions. Trump's spokesman, Brian Hughes, argues that the GOP nominee has appeal among African Americans, Hispanics, and labour union members, citing the Teamsters Union's decision not to endorse either candidate as a significant win for Trump.Meanwhile, Harris, who has only been in the presidential race for eight weeks, is beginning to articulate specific policy plans that favour liberal policies in most cases, such as combating climate change, supporting labour unions, and pushing for voting rights legislation to combat racial discrimination.

(AP) WASHINGTON: The United States said Thursday that Russia is on the verge of unleashing a massive military attack against Ukraine, dismissing Moscow's claim to be pulling forces back, as artillery fire hit a Ukrainian kindergarten.In a dramatic, previously unscheduled speech to the United Nations in New York, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said intelligence showed Moscow could order an assault on its neighbor in the "coming days."With US and other Western governments saying they see no evidence of Russia's claim to be withdrawing, Blinken challenged the Kremlin to "announce today with no qualification, equivocation or deflection that Russia will not invade Ukraine.""Demonstrate it by sending your troops, your tanks, your planes, back to their barracks and hangers," he said.Russia denies any invasion plans but warned of "military-technical measures" if its far-reaching demands for a US and NATO pullback from eastern Europe aren't satisfied.The United States said late Thursday that Blinken and his Moscow counterpart Sergei Lavrov had agreed to meet next week -- provided there was no invasion before then.Keeping up the pressure, President Joe Biden accused Moscow of preparing a "false flag operation" as a pretext for an attack."They have not moved any of their troops out. They've moved more troops in," Biden said. "Every indication we have is that they're prepared to go into Ukraine."He added, however, that diplomacy is not dead. "There is a path. There is a way through this," he said.Biden will hold a phone meeting Friday with the leaders of Germany, Britain, France, the European Union and NATO to discuss the Ukraine crisis.Russia has massed enormous air, land and sea forces around Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin and officials say the troops are only conducting practice exercises.However, Putin has made clear that the price for removing any threat would be Ukraine agreeing never to join NATO and for the Western alliance to pull back from a swath of eastern Europe, effectively splitting the continent into Cold War-style spheres of influence.The United States said that it had received Putin's response to its offers of a diplomatic solution to the crisis, but did not give any reaction to the contents.The Russian foreign ministry indicated that there was little to discuss."In the absence of will on the American side to negotiate firm and legally binding guarantees on our security from the United States and its allies, Russia will be forced to respond, including with military-technical measures," the foreign ministry said."We insist on the withdrawal of all US armed forces in Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Baltics."Russia also expelled the number two US diplomat in Moscow, the US State Department said, condemning the "unprovoked" action.Russia took over Ukraine's Crimea region and began backing heavily armed separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Lugansk regions in 2014, sparking a war that has already cost thousands of lives.Sporadic fighting remains common in the east, and the Ukrainian army accused the pro-Russian separatists of 34 ceasefire breaches on Thursday, 28 of them using heavy weapons.The potentially most serious incident -- an example of the kind of spark that many fear could ignite far more intense fighting -- was the shelling of a kindergarten in the village of Stanytsia-Luganska. Children were inside but none were hit.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted that the attack "by pro-Russian forces is a big provocation."Russian news agencies quoted authorities in the separatist Lugansk region saying they blamed Kyiv after the situation on the frontline "escalated significantly."Western capitals say they are also concerned by the Russian parliament's request that Putin grant unilateral recognition of independence for the separatists in eastern Ukraine."If this request were accepted, it would... demonstrate a Russian decision to choose a path of confrontation over dialogue," British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said.Putin earlier this week claimed with no evidence that Ukraine is committing "genocide" in the eastern region.Moscow has made several announcements of troop withdrawals this week and on Thursday said that tank units had begun returning to their bases from near Ukraine.The United States, NATO and Ukraine all said they had seen no evidence of a pullback, with Washington saying Russia had in fact moved 7,000 more troops near the border.According to US officials, there are now about 150,000 Russian troops arrayed in offensive groupings on the southern, eastern and northern borders of Ukraine.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  5 signs of a master manipulator, as per psychology5 traditional Indian hair oils for hair growthBigg Boss Kannada 11: Full and final list of contestantsFrom Golla getting his first seat on the flight to missing the last cable car in Interlaken; A look at Bharti Singh and Haarsh Limbachiyaa's first Europe Trip with their little munchkin5 sneakers you should stay away from; a Nike shoe is also on the list!5 body language tips to appear more confidentTop 5 Indian states with the highest per capita incomeWeekly Horoscope: September 30th to October 6th, 20247 vegetables that reduce belly fat quickly5 psychology tricks to make people magically like you123Hot PicksTirupati Laddu Case Hearing LiveDaylight Savings 2024Erika Carr UtahPakistan Job CutsNepal FloodsAir Canada FinedStock Market TodayTOP TRENDINGRafale Marine Flight JetsHarvard Application ProcessWho is Parita ParekhPaul HeymanDelhi Dwarka ExpresswayWWE Royal RumbleBad Blood 2024Carlos AlcarazMohammed SirajBrain Exercises to Boost MemoryTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website9 Timeless Skills That Will Always Be in Demand7 Effective Ways for Professionals to Enhance Productivity and Cultivate Inner Peace12 Effective Ways to Improve Handwriting for ExamsStock market crash today: BSE Sensex plunges over 1,200 points; Nifty50 ends below 25,850 - top reasons markets have tankedTNA Star Eric Young shared his thoughts on the docuseries about WWE’s former chairmanWho is Parita Parekh, youngest Indian entrepreneur and a Stanford alumnaSeventeen KIIT Athletics Who Participated in Paris Olympics & Paralympics Felicitated By Varsity'Team India ka Ghajini kaun hai?' - Rohit Sharma answers10 Common Habits That Could Be Hindering Your SuccessJ&K police head constable Bashir Ahmed killed after gunning down terrorist in Kathua encounterAs Biden calls for ceasefire, Israel tells US it will launch ground offensive in Lebanon soonHigh stakes in J&K polls phase 3: 415 candidates vie for 40 constituenciesKashmir’s ‘X factor’: Is he only a vote cutter or is he the real deal?'Fanatic theocrats leading you to abyss': Netanyahu warns IraniansMuda case: K'taka CM's wife offers to surrender 14 plotsSA20 Auction: Players, squads, date - everything you need to knowExplained: Silicon-carbon batteries have arrived in phones.

And scientists say the exceptionally hot year is part of a long-term warming trend that shows hints of accelerating. Two U.S. science agencies - NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - and a private measuring group released their calculations for last year's global temperature on Thursday, and all said it wasn't far behind ultra-hot 2016 and 2020. Six different calculations found 2021 was between the fifth and seventh hottest year since the late 1800s. NASA said 2021 tied with 2018 for sixth warmest, while NOAA puts last year in sixth place by itself, ahead of 2018. Scientists say a La Nina - natural cooling of parts of the central Pacific that changes weather patterns globally and brings chilly deep ocean water to the surface - dampened global temperatures just as its flip side, El Nino, boosted them in 2016.  Still, they said 2021 was the hottest La Nina year on record and that the year did not represent a cooling off of human-caused climate change but provided more of the same heat. "So it's not quite as headline-dominating as being the warmest on record, but give it another few years and we'll see another one of those" records, said climate scientist Zeke Hausfather of the Berkeley Earth monitoring group that also ranked 2021 the sixth hottest. "It's the long-term trend, and it's an indomitable march upward." Gavin Schmidt, the climate scientist who heads NASA's temperature team, said "the long-term trend is very, very clear. And it's because of us. And it's not going to go away until we stop increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere." The last eight years have been the eight hottest on record, NASA and NOAA data agree. Global temperatures, averaged over a 10-year period to take out natural variability, are nearly 2 degrees (1.1 degrees Celsius) warmer than 140 years ago, their data shows.  The other 2021 measurements came from the Japanese Meteorological Agency and satellite measurements by Copernicus Climate Change Service i n Europe and the University of Alabama in Huntsville. There was such a distinctive jump in temperatures about eight to 10 years ago that scientists have started looking at whether the rise in temperatures is speeding up. Both Schmidt and Hausfather said early signs point to that but it's hard to know for sure. "I think you can see the acceleration, but whether it's statistically robust is not quite clear," Schmidt said in an interview. "If you just look at the last the last 10 years, how many of them are way above the trend line from the previous 10 years? Almost all of them." The global average temperature last year was 58.5 degrees (14.7 Celsius), according to NOAA. In 1988, NASA's then-chief climate scientist James Hansen grabbed headlines when he testified to Congress about global warming in a year that was the hottest on record at the time. Now, the 57.7 degrees (14.3 Celsius) of 1988 ranks as the 28th hottest year on record.  Last year, 1.8 billion people in 25 Asian, African and Middle Eastern nations had their hottest years on record, including China, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Iran, Myanmar and South Korea, according to Berkeley Earth. The deep ocean, where most heat is stored in the seas, also set a record for warmth in 2021, according to a separate new study. "Ocean warming, aside from causing coral bleaching and threatening sea life and fish populations we rely upon for roughly 25% of our protein intake globally, is destabilizing Antarctic ice shelves and threatens massive ... sea level rise if we don't act," said study co-author Michael Mann, a Pennsylvania State University climate scientist. The last time Earth had a cooler than normal year by NOAA or NASA calculations was 1976. That means 69% of the people on the planet - more than 5 billion people under age 45 - have never experienced such a year, based on United Nations data. North Carolina state climatologist Kathie Dello, 39, who wasn't part of the new reports but said they make sense, said, "I've only lived in a warming world and I wish that the younger generations did not have to say the same. It didn't have to be this way."End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  Bigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial show5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the world​Bigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8​Bigg Boss 18: From Shehzada Dhami making serious allegations against Rajan Shahi to Alice Kaushik opening up about her parents’ demise: Major highlights from the show5 types of people one should completely avoid for peace in life, as per psychology10 most powerful countries in the world in 20245 minimalist habits to stop wasting your time​10 most educated countries of the world​From Aamir Khan's warm surprise with son Junaid to a musical tribute; A look at Amitabh Bachchan's 82nd Birthday celebration on the sets of Kaun Banega Crorepati 167 vegetables that reduce belly fat quicklyHow tall are Trump family membersTGIKS 2: From impersonating legendary cricketer MS Dhoni to revealing secrets from the World Cup: Top moments featuring Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and others123Hot PicksAssembly Election Result 2024 DateIsrael Hezbollah War Live2024 Nobel Prize in MedicineHaryana Assembly Constituencies 2024AIIMS Doctors Candle MarchPakistan Airport ExplosionChennai Air Show ChaosTOP TRENDINGElection Result Date and TimeKayla NicoleBasit AliWorld Richest FamilyThe San Francisco 49ersIsrael MossadRRB JE Exam DatePresident MuizzuJimmy UsosSadhguru QuotesTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteElection Results 2024 Live: Stage set in J&K, Haryana for first major BJP vs Congress showdown since Lok Sabha pollsTravis Kelce's Ex Kayla Nicole Delivers a Powerful 'Mental Health' Message While Facing Backlash from Taylor Swift Fans"Travis Kelce's career is over": Travis Kelce’s time in Kansas City may be numbered as the Chiefs decided to re-sign one of their familiar faces9 Powerful Quotes to Motivate Students Towards Success Through Hard WorkTop 10 Largest Economies In The World 2025: India To Become 4th Largest Economy Soon!

Israel on Thursday approved a fourth dose of vaccine for people with weakened immune systems, and Britain’s National Health Service said its hospitals would erect field wards to help deal with the surge in coronavirus cases.Several US states hit their all-time case records for coronavirus cases this week, disrupting the lives of millions of Americans. New York Mayor-elect Eric Adams vowed to keep the city’s vaccine mandate for private-sector employees in place, and the CDC issued a blunt warning to potential travelers: “Avoid cruise travel regardless of vaccination status.”Health officials are trying to encourage more Americans to get a booster shot — just over one-third of fully vaccinated adults have received one — and warn that the unvaccinated face the greatest risk of severe illness and death from omicron.“Our CDC guidance has been very clear that people should get their boost when they are eligible,” Dr. Rochelle PWalensky, the CDC director, told reporters this week. “That is both for — because of waning immunity and because we need more protection against Omicron.”Walensky said Wednesday that even as daily case counts had climbed by roughly 60% in the past week, hospitalizations and deaths were still relatively low, a suggestion that omicron might be less lethal. She and Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, cited international research hinting at the same conclusion.Studies have shown that while two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine have provided strong protection as the delta variant swarmed the country, omicron can evade the defenses of fully vaccinated people, heightening fears about the risks for young people.More than 70% of people 12 and older in the United States are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. Around one-quarter of children between 5 and 11 have received at least one dose. Children under 5 are still not eligible for a vaccine.The latest surge has caused a concerning rise in hospitalizations among children. But early data suggests that omicron appears to be causing milder illness for children, similar to findings for adults. And hospital officials and physicians have said that nearly all children hospitalized with Covid-19 were unvaccinated or partially vaccinated.Children can better withstand coronavirus infections but in rare instances can still become very sick and even die. At least 1.8 million adolescents between 12 and 15 years old have tested positive for the virus, according to the CDC.A series of studies published Thursday by the agency underscored how important vaccination can be for children and adolescents. In one study spanning July through early December that examined hundreds of adolescents in Arizona, researchers said two doses of the vaccine reduced the risk of infection by 92%.Two other CDC studies showed that there were few serious side effects reported among 5- to 11-year-olds who had received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and that pediatric hospitalizations occurred mostly among children who had not been fully vaccinated.A recent South African study showed that the effectiveness of Pfizer’s vaccine against severe illness and hospitalization was about 70% after two doses, against omicron in particular.Of the three federally authorized coronavirus shots, Pfizer-BioNTech's is the only vaccine approved for use in people under 18.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory committee is planning to meet by the middle of next week to weigh in on whether to recommend the changes in the FDA’s booster policy. If the committee agrees with the FDA’s authorizations, Walensky is expected to promptly endorse the revisions.Dr. Kathryn M. Edwards, a vaccine expert and professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said the FDA’s expected decision was justified.“We’re having a lot of suggestions and a lot of experience with omicron that it’s infecting people that have been boosted. But fortunately, we’re not seeing a lot of severe disease,” she said. “So I think if you look at the immune responses, at least in adults, you’ll see that this booster dose does enhance your neutralization capacity against omicron.”Other vaccine experts said the administration’s continued attention to offering boosters to younger, healthier people was misguided.Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, said research on vaccine effectiveness, including against omicron, had revealed that two doses offer substantial and durable protection against severe disease, including in adolescents — the purpose of vaccination, he said.A booster dose could increase a person's protection for several months, he said, but delivering extra shots to young Americans was “focusing on the people who are already protected.”The Biden administration, he added, should instead direct more attention to reaching the unvaccinated, a point he said was backed up by the overwhelming majority of hospitalized children he had seen in Philadelphia being unvaccinated.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the worldBigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial show​Bigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8​10 most powerful countries in the world in 20247 vegetables that reduce belly fat quickly​10 most educated countries of the world​How tall are Trump family membersTGIKS 2: From impersonating legendary cricketer MS Dhoni to revealing secrets from the World Cup: Top moments featuring Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and othersWhere the zodiac signs would prefer to liveFrom Bharti Singh- Elvish Yadav getting summoned in Rs 500 crore fraud case to Khushi Mali replacing Palak Sindhwani in Taarak Mehta: Top TV newsSunny Deol's 'Gadar', Shah Rukh Khan's 'Devdas', Rishi Kapoor's 'Chandni': Movies allegedly rejected by GovindaOptical illusion psychology test: The first thing you see reveals the hidden flaw affecting your relationships123Hot PicksIsrael Hezbollah War LiveBhopal Factory Drug SeizeGang Attack in HaitiAIIMS Doctors Candle MarchPakistan Airport ExplosionChennai Air Show ChaosHurricane Milton EvacuationTOP TRENDINGKarachi Airport BlastKayla NicoleWorld Richest FamilyThe San Francisco 49ersIsrael MossadPrince WilliamPresident MuizzuChinese Spy BallonsRishabh PantSadhguru QuotesTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website"Travis Kelce's career is over": Travis Kelce’s time in Kansas City may be numbered as the Chiefs decided to re-sign one of their familiar facesTravis Kelce's Ex Kayla Nicole Delivers a Powerful 'Mental Health' Message While Facing Backlash from Taylor Swift Fans'Diddy List': Names of celebrities connected to Sean Combs viral3 dead in Chennai after Indian Air Force air showFour spectators dead after Chennai air showPresident Muizzu in India: 'Will never hurt India's security interests, Maldives first but will prioritise ties with India'1 dead, 10 injured in massive explosion near Karachi airportIAF quietly shooting down 'Chinese spy balloons' at high altitudes'Wouldn't have given birth': Gaza mother struggles to provide for newborns amid conflictRishabh Pant's Masterclass: How India conquered the fortress GabbaMiracle at 17,000 ft: How two US & UK climbers were rescued from HimalayasRahul's heartfelt cooking session with Dalit man, his family;

Lance Lowry (Agency photo) NEW YORK: At a Georgia state House of Representatives hearing on prison conditions in September, a corrections officer called in to testify, interrupting his shift to tell lawmakers how dire conditions had become. On a "good day," he told lawmakers, he had maybe six or seven officers to supervise roughly 1,200 people. He said he had recently been assigned to look after 400 prisoners by himself.There weren't enough nurses to provide medical care. "All the officers ... absolutely despise working there," said the officer, who didn't give his name for fear of retaliation. In Texas, Lance Lowry quit after 20 years as a corrections officer to become a long-haul trucker because he couldn't bear the job any longer. Watching friends and coworkers die from COVID-19, along with dwindling support from his superiors, wore on him. "I would have liked to stay till I was 50," said Lowry, 48. "But the pandemic changed that." Staff shortages have long been a challenge for prison agencies, given the low pay and grueling nature of the work. But the coronavirus pandemic - and its impact on the labor market - has pushed many corrections systems into crisis. Officers are retiring and quitting in droves, while officials struggle to recruit new employees. And some prisons whose populations dropped during the pandemic have seen their numbers rise again, exacerbating the problem. There is no one thing pushing prison employees out in high numbers now. Some are leaving for new opportunities as more places are hiring. University of Michigan economist Betsey Stevenson pointed to the increased risk of COVID-19 for people working in prisons. "When jobs become riskier, it becomes harder to attract workers," she wrote in an email. "By failing to protect prisoners from COVID, the criminal justice system not only created an unfair risk of severe illness and death for the incarcerated, but the increased COVID risk to employees has undoubtedly contributed to staffing shortages." Unions representing prison officers in states including Massachusetts and California and at the federal level also claim vaccine mandates will drive out unvaccinated employees and exacerbate understaffing, though it's unclear how big of an impact those rules will have. "There are dozens of reasons to leave and very few to stay," said Brian Dawe, national director of One Voice United, a nonprofit supporting corrections officers. "Understaffing, poor pay, poor benefits, horrendous working conditions. Officers and their families in many jurisdictions have had enough." Employers from construction companies to restaurants are having difficulty hiring and keeping people. Nearly 3% of American workers, 4.3 million, quit their jobs in August, according to new data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the stakes are higher in prisons, where having fewer guards means significantly more dangerous conditions for incarcerated people. And for the officers left behind, worsening shortages have made an already difficult job unbearable, many say. In Georgia, some prisons report up to 70% vacancy rates. In Nebraska, overtime hours have quadrupled since 2010, as fewer officers are forced to work longer hours. Florida has temporarily closed three prisons out of more than 140 because of understaffing, and vacancy rates have nearly doubled there in the last year. And at federal prisons across the country, guards are picketing in front of their facilities over understaffing, while everyone from prison teachers to dentists is pulled in to cover security shifts. In recent weeks, reporters from The Marshall Project and The Associated Press have spoken with workers, officials, attorneys and people incarcerated in more than a dozen prison systems to understand the consequences of the staffing shortfalls. The federal Bureau of Prisons says about 93% of its front-line guard positions are filled, with little more than 1,000 vacancies, though workers in many prisons say they're feeling the pinch as others are conscripted to fill in for missing officers. Asked last week in a U.S. Senate hearing about federal prison staffing, Attorney General Merrick Garland said, "I agree this is a serious problem at the Bureau of Prisons." Garland told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco was working with the bureau to address staffing issues. Inside prisons, growing shortages mean a rise in lockdowns. Restrictions that might have begun as a way to stop the spread of COVID-19 have continued because there aren't enough guards to supervise activities. Some incarcerated people say they can't take classes, participate in group therapy sessions or even work out in the recreation yard or take a shower. That can force those in general population into de facto solitary confinement, and those already in segregation into near-total lockdown. "If we get rec once a week, that's a good week," said Anthony Haynes, who is on Texas' death row in a unit that is barely half-staffed. "We don't always get showers." A spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice did not respond to Haynes' claims but acknowledged that staffing is a challenge in Texas' prisons. "Before COVID-19, staffing was frequently impacted by economic surges and competing employment opportunities," said spokesman Robert Hurst in an email. "The pandemic has exacerbated these issues. We also recognize that the job of the correctional officer is one of the most difficult in all of state government." He added that Texas has closed six of its more than 100 facilities in the last year due to staffing problems. Kansas has cut job training and reduced supervision for people after they're released. Two-thirds of the men in Nebraska's prisons can't see visitors on the weekends - when most families are free to travel - because of understaffing. Dr. Homer Venters, a former chief medical officer for the jail system in New York City, inspects conditions in prisons around the country for court cases. Understaffing will lead to an increase in preventable prison deaths, he said, as the quality of care reaches new lows. "Things are much worse behind bars now than they have been for a long time," Venters said. "There are so many staff that have left. That means that basic clinical services, like getting to scheduled appointments, just isn't happening the way it was even five years ago."End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  Bigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial showSchengen visa denials: 5 countries with the highest rejection ratesSanjay Dutt-Manyata to Hardik Pandya-Natasa Stankovic: Bollywood couples who renewed their wedding vows5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the world8 animals that help Earth heal and how5 psychology tips to be more mature in life and relationships10 most powerful countries in the world in 2024From getting kicked out from Shark Tank India 4 to marrying a Mexico-based model, buying India’s first : Times when Deepinder Goyal made headlines​Bigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8​123Hot PicksUS Election Timeline 2024World's Fastest JetsDelhi Drugs in NamkeenHarris vs Trump Latest PollsUP Scholarships Non-Creamy LayerMahadev Betting AppStock market todayTOP TRENDINGRic FlairNavi Mumbai AirportPrince HarryNFL Week SeasonActor NithinIPL FranchisesAyudha Puja DateRatan TataKali Crown BangladeshDiddy ListTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website“When you know, you know”: Russell Wilson’s Wife Ciara Revealed That She Knew Wilson Was The One After Their First DateTollywood actor Nithin arrested for snatching gold chain in HyderabadRatan Tata’s successor: Noel Tata appointed chairman of Tata TrustsDiwali 2024 Date: When is Deepawali?

(Agency photo) NEW YORK: US President Thomas Jefferson's statue, a presence for more than a century in the New York City Council chamber, is coming down following a public commission reassessment of the legacy of the founding father who was also a slaveholder. The New York City Public Design Commission voted unanimously on Monday to dismantle the 7-foot (2.13-meter) bronze likeness of Jefferson, which has watched over proceedings in the most populous U.S.city since 1915. The commission agreed to lend the 187-year-old statue long-term to the New-York Historical Society. It is a plaster model of a statue still on display in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. "Jefferson embodied some of the most shameful parts of our country's long and nuanced history," Councilperson Adrienne Adams, co-chair of the council's Black, Latino and Asian Caucus, told the commission. "It is time for the city to turn the page and move forward." Similar monuments have become a target of anti-racism protests in recent years. Statues of Civil War Confederate leaders have also been dismantled.Jefferson's place in U.S. history is complex. Having written that "all men are created equal" as the primary author of the Declaration of Independence, he also enslaved more than 600 people and fathered at least six children with Sally Hemings, a woman he enslaved. Not everyone supported the removal of the statue. Sean Wilentz, a American history professor at Princeton University, wrote in a letter read to the commission: "The statue specifically honors Jefferson for his greatest contribution to America, indeed, to humankind."

(Getty Images)  WASHINGTON: Pakistan and its intelligence service have played a key role in fostering the Taliban and allowing it to eventually take over Afghanistan, a top Republican lawmaker has alleged, stating that it is disgusting to watch Islamabad celebrate the group's victory that will bring "untold brutality" to Afghans.Congressman Steve Chabot, Co-Chair of the India Caucus, said in his address to the virtual gala of Hindu Political Action Committee on Sunday that he applauds the Indian government for welcoming the Afghan religious minorities who have a good reason to fear persecution at the hands of the Taliban and their evil rule.“In contrast, we all know that Pakistan and particularly its intelligence services played a key role fostering the Taliban and allowing them to eventually take over. It's just disgusting to watch Pakistani officials celebrate the victory of this group that will bring untold brutality to the Afghan people,” Chabot said.“Pakistan's own persecution of religious minorities, however, gets a lot less attention here in America than it deserves. We would do well to educate our fellow citizens about these abuses. Persecution is particularly manifests in the heinous practice of the kidnapping, force conversion to Islam and forced marriage of underage Hindu girls to older Muslim men,” he said.Such allegations are not mere hearsay, he noted.Major news organisations and human rights groups have documented the practice with so many heartbreaking stories of girls in their early teens taken from their families, and traffic into forced marriages. These abuses are often just ignored, said the Congressman.In his address, Chabot said that with roughly 6 million Hindus in America, Hindus are unquestionably an integral part of society throughout the United States.“Through strong work ethic and high educational attainment, Hindus exemplify the American dream. These virtues also allow Hindus to take on key roles in communities across the country, and also give back to those communities in so many ways,” he said.That is why the reports of a rise in discrimination against Hindu Americans around the country are so concerning, he rued, adding that there is no place in America for such discrimination.“We must all seek ways to bring it to an end,” Chabot added.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  Bigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial show5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the world​Bigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8​Bigg Boss 18: From Shehzada Dhami making serious allegations against Rajan Shahi to Alice Kaushik opening up about her parents’ demise: Major highlights from the show5 types of people one should completely avoid for peace in life, as per psychology10 most powerful countries in the world in 20245 minimalist habits to stop wasting your time​10 most educated countries of the world​From Aamir Khan's warm surprise with son Junaid to a musical tribute; A look at Amitabh Bachchan's 82nd Birthday celebration on the sets of Kaun Banega Crorepati 167 vegetables that reduce belly fat quicklyHow tall are Trump family membersTGIKS 2: From impersonating legendary cricketer MS Dhoni to revealing secrets from the World Cup: Top moments featuring Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and others123Hot PicksAssembly Election Result 2024 DateIsrael Hezbollah War Live2024 Nobel Prize in MedicineHaryana Assembly Constituencies 2024AIIMS Doctors Candle MarchPakistan Airport ExplosionChennai Air Show ChaosTOP TRENDINGElection Result Date and TimeKayla NicoleBasit AliWorld Richest FamilyThe San Francisco 49ersIsrael MossadRRB JE Exam DatePresident MuizzuJimmy UsosSadhguru QuotesTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteElection Results 2024 Live: Stage set in J&K, Haryana for first major BJP vs Congress showdown since Lok Sabha pollsTravis Kelce's Ex Kayla Nicole Delivers a Powerful 'Mental Health' Message While Facing Backlash from Taylor Swift Fans"Travis Kelce's career is over": Travis Kelce’s time in Kansas City may be numbered as the Chiefs decided to re-sign one of their familiar faces9 Powerful Quotes to Motivate Students Towards Success Through Hard WorkTop 10 Largest Economies In The World 2025: India To Become 4th Largest Economy Soon!

(Reuters Photo) WASHINGTON: Democrats face a test of unity in the US House of Representatives on Monday as they begin work on two ambitious spending plans that would devote trillions of dollars to transportation infrastructure and social programs.While centrist Democrats are eager to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that has already won approval in the Senate, liberals say they must prioritize a $3.5 trillion budget blueprint that would expand spending on child care and education.Both measures are priorities for Democratic President Joe Biden.The first test will come on Monday evening when the House is due to vote on a package that would advance both spending bills, as well as a separate voting rights proposal.That would clear the way for a final vote on the budget plan and the voting rights bill on Tuesday, but would not set a timeline for passage of the infrastructure bill.Nine moderates who are pushing the House to first pass the infrastructure bill have threatened to vote against the package. That could potentially scuttle it in the House, where Democrats hold a 220-212 majority."There is a standoff with some of our colleagues who have decided to hold the infrastructure bill hostage for months, or kill it altogether if they don’t get what they want in the next bill," they wrote in the Washington Post on Monday.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has sided with liberals who worry they might lose leverage on the social spending effort if they first pass the infrastructure bill. She wants the House to complete work on both bills by Oct. 1."Any delay to passing the budget resolution threatens the timetable for delivering the historic progress and the transformative vision that Democrats share," Pelosi wrote fellow Democrats on Saturday.No Republicans are expected to support the budget resolution plan, which sets the broad outline for spending on education, childcare, healthcare and climate measures favoured by Biden and pays for them with tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations.Crucially, the budget resolution plan would allow Democrats to pass those spending measures on a simple majority vote in the Senate, rather than the 60 votes required for most legislation in that chamber.The Senate is split 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats. Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris has the power, however, to cast the tie-breaking vote.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  Bigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial show​Bigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8​5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the worldFrom 'Bigg Boss' star to fitness icon: Shehnaaz Gill's inspiring weight loss journey10 most powerful countries in the world in 2024Universe Guidance For Each Zodiac SignTop 10 Largest Economies In The World 2025: India To Become 4th Largest Economy Soon!

(Reuters Photo)  WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden is brushing off criticism of his administration's chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal because he and his aides believe the political fallout at home will be limited, according to White House allies and administration officials.Biden and his top aides argue they are managing an evacuation mission https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/afghanistan-edge-after-anti-taliban-protest-east-kabul-calm-airlift-goes-2021-08-19 as well as could be expected given the faster-than-anticipated takeover of the country by the Taliban, and are seeking to draw attention back to the choice to get U.S.troops out of the country.The strategy is based on internal and public polling that shows the Afghanistan withdrawal had been by far the most popular decision Biden has made, even though the issue was not central for most voters."The public opinion is pretty damn clear that Americans wanted out of the ongoing war and don't want to get back in. It's true today and it's going to be true in six months," said one Biden ally. "It isn't about not caring or being empathetic about what's going on over there but worrying about what's happening in America."Biden has faced criticism even from some fellow Democrats for his handling of the crisis.But White House officials believe Americans' horror over graphic images https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/small-afghan-girl-is-lifted-crowd-capturing-desperation-flee-kabul-2021-08-19 of the chaos in Kabul and pleas from Afghans who fear they will be killed by the Taliban will morph into support for the president's decision to pull troops from the country by Aug. 31 after a 20-year war.They expect the Afghanistan story to recede from the headlines, replaced by the resurgence in COVID-19 cases, the economic recovery and other issues, people familiar with the matter said.A White House spokesperson declined to comment.Biden aides honed talking points weeks ago to be used even in the worst-case scenarios of a withdrawal, some of which have come to pass, including emphasizing that leaving Afghanistan was the right decision."The idea that somehow, there's a way to have gotten out without chaos ensuing, I don't know how that happens," Biden told ABC News on Wednesday. "There is no good time to leave Afghanistan. Fifteen years ago would've been a problem, 15 years from now. The basic choice is am I going to send your sons and your daughters to war in Afghanistan in perpetuity?"In recent days, Biden has also assailed the Afghan military for refusing to fight, denounced the now-ousted Afghan government and declared he inherited a bad withdrawal agreement from his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump.The strategy has obvious risks, political experts say. "The concern is that it's going to undercut his credibility as commander in chief," said Jim Manley, once a top aide to former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. "If the Taliban revert to what they've done in the past, and I assume that's going to be the case, it's going to be a lot of bad images coming out of that country."INADEQUATE RESPONSEThe Afghanistan messaging is increasingly at odds with an emerging consensus within the administration that the White House, Defense and State departments as well as the U.S. intelligence community's planning for the current situation was inadequate and needs to be fully reviewed once the mission of evacuating key people from Afghanistan is complete and the 5,200 U.S. troops now in Kabul are gone."We're at the Pentagon and even we know it could have been better," said one official. "A lot better." Members of the U.S. Congress also plan to investigate what went wrong.Public opinion, at least for now, is mixed. A majority of both Republican and Democratic voters say https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-approval-drops-lowest-level-this-year-after-taliban-takeover-2021-08-17 the swift capitulation of the Afghan government "is evidence why the U.S. should get out of the conflict."Reuters/Ipsos polling this week found that 31% of American adults agreed that the United States should continue its military operations in Afghanistan, up from the 25% who felt the same way in a 2012 poll.Yet Ipsos polling https://tmsnrt.rs/3k4cwxs conducted on Monday also showed fewer than half of Americans liked the way Biden had steered the U.S. military and diplomatic effort in Afghanistan this year. They currently rate his performance worse than the other three presidents who presided over the United States' longest war, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Trump.Biden's overall approval sank to 46% of American adults in Reuters/Ipsos polling, the lowest recorded in weekly polls since he took office in January.Republicans, including Trump, have started weaponizing the withdrawal as an issue to undermine faith in Biden as commander in chief.Most Democrats are likely to embrace public support of the withdrawal decision, and the issue should die down before the November 2022 congressional elections, said one adviser working on Democratic congressional campaigns.She added, however: "The Biden administration will likely have to defend every negative headline that comes out of Afghanistan during his tenure, so that is a real unknown."End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  From being 3 months pregnant while sitting on the hotseat to her son calling Amitabh Bachchan 'dadu'; Shruthy Daga opens up about her 'arranged marriage', KBC14 Journey and more9 morning habits that can bring down cholesterol levels within a monthLaughter Chefs: From Bharti Singh- Krushna Abhishek getting emotional to Nia Sharma getting teary eyed on missing Sudesh Lehri: Top moments from the recent episodeAstro-Numerology October 2024: Sanjay B Jumaani's Predictions for Each Number (1-9)5 traditional Indian hair oils for hair growth5 herbal drinks that help in reducing blood sugar levelsHappy Gandhi Jayanti 2024: Images, Wishes, Messages, Quotes, Pictures and Greeting CardsFrom Prince Narula - Yuvika Chaudhary to Keith Sequeira - Rochelle Maria Rao; Couples who found love in the Bigg Boss houseOptical illusion psychology test: What you see first reveals what you truly want in a relationship5 body language tips to appear more confidentWinter is coming: 5 places in India for a winter vacation in October5 signs of a master manipulator, as per psychology123Hot PicksIsrael Hezbollah War LiveOldest Miss UniverseErika Carr UtahPakistan Job CutsJ&K Phase 3 Elections LiveAir Canada FinedStock Market TodayTOP TRENDINGTimeless SkillHelicopter Crashes PuneIran Israel ConflictIND vs PAK T20 World CupBrittany MahomesMorne MorkelGaurav TanejaMichael VaughanRahul GandhiBrain Exercises to Boost MemoryTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website"Tears of Joy and Sorrow: Brittany Mahomes’ Heartfelt Reflection Amid Family Health Struggles"'Diddy List': Names of celebrities connected to Sean Combs viralHow tall is JD Vance?

The Daniel K Inouye Solar Telescope, at the summit of Haleakalā volcano on Maui, was supposed to open last fall. But Thomas Rimmele told Hawaii Public Radio on Wednesday that the Covid-19 travel restrictions set back construction on its critical systems.He hopes the current schedule won't be affected by newly surging coronavirus cases and any additional restrictions. Rimmele was expecting to return to Maui as early as this week. "November 15 is what we're shooting for. We just had a big review, the final construction review that was conducted by the National Science Foundation," Rimmele said. "(The scientists) are getting really anxious to get their observations and data done." The telescope has received about 100 proposals from researchers for an initial observing window of two-and-a-half months. Picking, which scientists get to go first, depends heavily on atmospheric conditions and what objects are visible on a given day.  He said one quarter or even a fifth of the proposals may be approved for the first cycle. "We are highly oversubscribed and people will have to submit proposals again for the next cycle," he said. "That's just how it works."The National Solar Observatory said the Inouye telescope will be able to reveal features three times smaller than anything scientists are able to see on the Sun currently. The Hawaii Supreme Court in 2016 affirmed a permit for the solar telescope's construction. The next year, more than 100 protesters tried to block a construction convoy heading to the telescope site, citing the sacredness of Haleakala's summit. Maui police had then arrested six people.

Cricket's Rs 1,400 crore question: Should India even play Pakistan in the Asia Cup?
Pakistan’s latest meltdown against West Indies is another instance of their struggles across formats. The Asia Cup in UAE which could see them clash vs India thrice, provided both qualify for final, was meant to trigger hype and boost the broadcasters’ revenue. However, with Pakistan’s form and record vs India being so poor, one wonders how enthused cricket fans will be about what was a marquee match not too long ago

The Asia Cup in UAE which could see them clash vs India thrice, provided both qualify for final, was meant to trigger hype and boost the broadcasters’ revenue. However, with Pakistan’s form and record vs India being so poor, one wonders how enthused cricket fans will be about what was a marquee match not too long ago India could meet Pakistan thrice in the Asia Cup that will be played in September in the UAE. The debate over whether India should face Pakistan in the upcoming Asia Cup has divided opinion across the country, reflecting ongoing discussions about one of cricket’s most storied rivalries.Proponents argue that an India–Pakistan clash should proceed, asserting that the intense rivalry significantly boosts revenues, adding substantially to the coffers like no other cricket match-up. They contend that India, often regarded as the subcontinent’s ‘big brother’, has a role in financially sustaining other cricket-playing nations.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Conversely, opponents maintain that engaging in cricket matches with a nation they were at war with merely months earlier is untenable. They argue that there is no compelling reason to schedule cricket fixtures while broader bilateral tensions between the two neighbours remain unresolved.Amidst this heated debate, a common understanding among fans persists that the India–Pakistan rivalry remains cricket’s most heated and eagerly anticipated encounter. However, this perception warrants re-examination.Is the rivalry still as fierce? India and Pakistan last contested a Test match 18 years ago. Over the past 15 years, they have played 16 One Day Internationals (ODIs), with India securing twelve victories, and thirteen T20 matches, of which India has won ten.A snapshot of Pakistan's win-loss record since the 2022 T20 World Cup. The International Cricket Council (ICC) marketed the India–Pakistan match as the premier clash at the T20 World Cup in the United States last year. In the tournament, Pakistan not only lost to India but also to the hosts and the minor team USA in the first round.On Tuesday, the West Indies achieved a comprehensive victory over Pakistan in the third ODI in Tarouba, bowling them out for a mere 92 runs, underscoring the team’s ongoing struggles. Apart from home and away wins against Bangladesh earlier this year, the national team’s ODI performances have been lacklustre over the past two years.These statistics resurface regularly. Considering that India and Pakistan could potentially meet three times in the Asia Cup – during the league stage, the Super Four, and potentially the final – one wonders if it will live up to its anticipated status.India will meet Pakistan on September 14 in the group stage of the Asia Cup 2025.From an economic perspective, the India–England and India–Australia fixtures have seen exponential growth in recent years. For instance, the recent Anderson–Tendulkar Trophy, a five-Test series, recorded the highest-ever viewership numbers for digital broadcasts. Furthermore, the 2017 Border–Gavaskar series in India, followed by the 2024 leg in Australia, have become the highest-grossing bilateral cricket events to date.For the India–Pakistan rivalry to achieve similar financial success, the quality of cricket between the two nations would need a significant improvement. The primary benefits of India participating in the Asia Cup are twofold: firstly, assured financial gains for cricket boards across the subcontinent through media rights revenue; secondly, fostering goodwill ahead of discussions when India hosts the 2026 T20 World Cup.India vs Pakistan in last 15 yearsODI Matches: 17India wins: 12Pakistan wins: 4No Result: 1T20I matches: 13India wins: 10Pakistan wins: 3With media rights revenues valued at approximately Rs 1,400 crore for three tournaments (plus approximately Rs 290 crore from ground rights), each cricket board is guaranteed a minimum of Rs 290 to 332 crore over six years – an outcome unattainable without India’s involvement. In the context of the T20 World Cup, media rights revenues are several times higher than those of the Asia Cup.Ultimately, it is the financial stakes of the India–Pakistan match that remain high, while on-field competitiveness has diminished to a mere myth.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

PAK vs WI |Shoaib Akhtar - Babar aur Rizwan kab match winners banenge? ’
Following Pakistan's defeat against West Indies, Shoaib Akhtar criticized Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan for failing to be match-winners. West Indies defeated Pakistan by 202 runs, clinching the ODI series 2-1 after Jayden Seales's six-wicket haul dismantled Pakistan's batting lineup. Akhtar emphasized the need for Babar Azam to accelerate his scoring after reaching fifty, converting good starts into match-winning performances.

Ali fears a heavy loss against India and suggests that a defeat to Afghanistan would be less impactful than losing to their arch-rivals. Pakistan cricket team during the second ODI against West Indies. (ANI) Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali, among others, have raised concern about the team's chances in the Asia Cup after a harrowing defeat against West Indies in the third ODI. West Indies came from 0-1 down in the series to clinch it 2-1, ending a 34-year drought over the 1992 World Cup winners.In the third match, played in Tarouba, Pakistan managed only 92 runs while chasing a target of 295. The 202-run loss was Pakistan's fourth biggest loss in their ODI history."I pray India refuse to play against Pakistan in the Asia Cup, just like how they did at the World Championships of Legends. Itni buri tarah maarenge na vo, ki aapki soch hai," Basit Ali said on The Game Plan YouTube channel.Basit Ali further addressed the possibility of losing to Afghanistan, stating: "If we lose to Afghanistan, no one would care much in this country. But everyone goes mad the moment you lose to India."PollWill Pakistan's performance improve in the upcoming Asia Cup?Yes, they will bounce backNo, it will be more of the sameThe Pakistani batting order crumbled from the start of their chase, with three top-order wickets falling within the first three overs. Openers Saim Ayub and Abdullah Shafique, along with captain Mohammad Rizwan, were dismissed without scoring any runs.Star batter Babar Azam could only contribute 9 runs, while Salman Agha managed 30 runs before his dismissal. The entire innings concluded in just 29.2 overs, with West Indies bowler Jayden Seales delivering an exceptional performance, taking 6 wickets for 18 runs.The loss against West Indies came despite Pakistan's earlier success in the T20I series against the same opposition, which they won 2-1 under Salman Agha's leadership.The upcoming Asia Cup, scheduled to take place in the UAE, will be played in the T20 format, serving as preparation for next year's T20 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.Pakistan's T20 squad composition may differ from their ODI team, as neither Babar Azam nor Mohammad Rizwan participated in the successful T20I series against West Indies, a pattern that might continue in the Asia Cup.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

'Shouldn't have had a place': Irfan Pathan's brutal take on Rohit Sharma playing Test cricket in 2024
Irfan Pathan suggested that Rohit Sharma's place in the Test team was potentially in jeopardy during 2024 due to poor performances, particularly highlighting his struggles in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Pathan acknowledged the perception of biased support towards Sharma, and argued that he only kept his place in the squad because he was captain.

Rohit Sharma retired from Tests in May (Image via Getty Images) Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has claimed that Rohit Sharma might have found it difficult to retain his place in the Test team during the latter half of 2024 had he not been the captain.Pathan recalled Rohit’s poor run during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia earlier that year. The opener averaged just 6.20 across three matches before opting out of the final Test in Sydney. “Rohit Sharma is an amazing player in white-ball cricket, but his average in Test cricket that year was 6, so we said that if he was not the captain, he would not have had a place in the team, and this is true,” Pathan said, speaking in a Lallantop video.IRFAN PATHAN FLYING FROM MUMBAI SPOTTED AT AIRPORTGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! At the time, Rohit addressed the decision in an interview with Pathan and Jatin Sapru during the match on January 5. “This is what I say. Stand down. I will say a few words, fifty words will be made out of it. So basically, runs are not coming from my bat, I am not in form, it is an important match, we need players in form, the boys in our batting are not in form, so you cannot carry too many out-of-form players in the team,” Rohit had explained. “It was difficult for me to take this decision but if everything is put in front of us, then this decision was sensible, and I will not think too much ahead. What the team needed at this time, this was the only thought, and there was no other thought apart from that,” he added. Pathan also addressed perceptions that he and others had been overly supportive of Rohit. “People say that we supported Rohit Sharma more than necessary. Of course, when someone comes to interview on your broadcasting channel, you will not misbehave with them, right? You have invited him, so you will behave politely… we had to show that, because he was our guest,” Pathan said.PollDo you think Rohit Sharma would have retained his place in the Test team if he wasn't captain?Yes, definitelyNo, he would have been dropped However, he maintained his stance on Rohit’s place in the side. “We had said that he should keep fighting, but that said, he should not have had a place in the playing XI. If he was not the captain of the team, he would have been dropped.” Rohit later rediscovered his touch in white-ball cricket, guiding India to the Champions Trophy title in March 2025, before retiring from Test cricket on May 7.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Ravindra Jadeja faces scrutiny over his ODI strike rate. Axar Patel emerges as a strong contender, showcasing impactful performances. Washington Sundar is also in contention. India's Ravindra Jadeja  (AP/PTI) A lull in India’s cricketing calendar allows space and time for various stories to come out. With the country still delusional over the team’s thrilling six-run victory at The Oval to square the series against England 2-2, media reports emerged that Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, two batting stalwarts and players, who had already bid adieu to Tests and T20Is, could be playing in their last 50-over series Down Under in Oct.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! For fans of the two players, who were expected to bow out only after the 50-over World Cup in Oct-Nov 2027 in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia, it came as a shock. The fan clubs of the two players, always at war on social media, were united in grief after reading reports of their probable exit from ODIs as they directed their collective ire at chief selector Ajit Agarkar and coach Gautam Gambhir. While plenty was discussed about the white-ball futures of both Rohit and Virat and how unfair it was to make the two stalwarts go through the grind of playing Vijay Hazare Trophy and India A games to prove themselves, another cricketer might be skating on thin ice when it comes to his white-ball future.Ravindra Jadeja, the Saurashtra stalwart, might have had his best series as a batter in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy with 516 runs and six half-centuries, but his strike rate in ODIs has been a subject of debate as it has not been at par with the pace at which runs are scored in the format lately. In 204 ODIs, his 2,806 runs have been scored at a strike rate of 85.44. The fact that he has batted at No.7 or lower, a position where big-hitters walk in and target the boundaries, puts additional scrutiny on those numbers. In fact, in the 11 games that he has batted in at No.6, his average of 30 and strike rate of 81.44 also does not meet modern requirements. Jadeja’s last outing at that number was his laborious 22-ball 9 in the 2023 World Cup final at Ahmedabad, where he was strangely sent in ahead of Surya Kumar Yadav, curiously to inject some pace in the innings that had got stuck as KL Rahul and Virat Kohli erred on the side of caution while rebuilding the innings after India lost three wickets for 81 runs. Jadeja has batted at No.7 98 times in 148 matches and has scored 2,000 runs at 83.41. In 2023, that strike rate had dropped to 79.16. With the death overs of modern ODI batting requiring explosive skills, India would be justified in looking at someone with a wider range of strokes and greater power.PollWho do you think is more crucial for India’s ODI success moving forward?Ravindra JadejaAxar PatelWashington Sundar In Axar Patel, they probably have an ideal like-for-like replacement. The lanky Gujarat southpaw batted at No.5 in the 2024 T20 World Cup final against South Africa at Barbados, and, despite India stuttering at 34 for 3, belted a momentum-changing 31-ball 47 that allowed Kohli the freedom to drop anchor and bat deep. Axar was a floater in the batting order during the victorious campaign and had been used tactically, especially as a hitter against spin on the sluggish pitches in the Caribbean. On spin-friendly surfaces in the sub-continent, West Indies and Dubai, he has been used to break the monotony of right-handers following each other. In the Champions Trophy in the UAE, his 30-ball 27 in the semifinal against Australia and his 29, which included the tactical takedown of Mitchell Santner of New Zealand in the final, made the equation more comfortable for the lower order. Axar’s average of 22.37 may not appear earth-shattering, but the fact that he has scored those runs at 91.47 at crucial times makes him an attractive package in ODIs. In Indian victories, he has scored his runs at 97.97. Because his batting has come along wonderfully, Axar’s bowling is seldom discussed. Finger spinners, thanks to modern batting-friendly field restrictions and rules, have been reduced to cannon fodder. However, his fastish round-arm finger spin has cost India only 4.49 runs per over. He may not have had a five-wicket haul to show for his efforts yet in the 63 times he has bowled in ODIs, but that could be because he has completed his quota of 10 overs just 29 times in his career. His average (32.94) and strike rate (43.9) also make him a useful option. Jadeja, who has bowled in 196 innings in the 204 times he has played for India in the blue jersey, has picked up 231 scalps at 35.41 and an economy rate of 4.85. His strike rate of 43.7 is better, though, than Axar’s. What goes in favour of Axar is the fact that he often bowls in the powerplay in T20s and in the IPL and wouldn’t be averse to doing it in the ODIs too. The speed at which he bowls and the height at which the balls comes down makes charging at him difficult for batters. Both Jadeja and Axar are assets in the field. But India now also have another talented spin-bowling all-rounder in the form of Washington Sundar, who can strike it big in the end overs and is technically adept to bat in the top-6. The fact that he is still only 25, is a safe fielder and an excellent powerplay bowler, makes him an attractive option for captains and coaches to lend balance to the team and field a long batting order. Both Rohit and Virat probably lost the right to go to England because of a sustained poor run in Tests. In ODIs, though, their numbers have been excellent. It is only their age and the fact they would be 40 and 39 respectively when the 2027 ODI World Cup comes around that has made the management wary about picking them beyond Australia. Jadeja too would be close to 39 when the World Cup is staged in 2027.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

The double ton in Birmingham is obviously something I’ll cherish forever and will be one of the highlights of my tour to England.”Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Gill’s numbers backed up his words. He was the standout performer in the Anderson Tendulkar Trophy, scoring 754 runs in 10 innings at an average of 75.40. July alone brought him 567 runs in three Tests at an average of 94.50, including three centuries and a career-best 269 at Edgbaston. That innings was not only a personal milestone but also the spark for India’s comeback after losing the series opener in Leeds.PollDo you believe Shubman Gill will continue to excel as India's captain in future series?Yes, definitelyProbablyUncertainNo, I don't think so His 430-run aggregate in Birmingham is one of the highest in Test history and the best by any visiting batter in England. Along the way, Gill surpassed Sunil Gavaskar’s record for most runs in a Test series as Indian captain and became the first Asian to score more than 700 runs in a series on English soil. While he had lean patches at Lord’s and The Oval, his earlier contributions ensured India finished the series 2-2. The award is Gill’s fourth, cementing his status as one of the game’s most consistent and impactful players.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

The comment referenced Root's record against Hazlewood, who has dismissed him 10 times in 31 innings at an average of 31.40.Speaking to Sky Sports Root responded to Warner's comments with composure, saying: "Just that. I have no control over how people perceive the game or discuss it in an interview. Nothing new, is it? You know there are going to be storylines and people wanting to hype up a big series. Does not really change anything. It is sort of irrelevant to me. What can I do about it? Just make sure it is not a talking point in six months or 100 days' time."The English batter further added: "When you get out there, you have to got to try and impact the game and help your team get off to a good start. Business as usual as far as I am concerned. I guess it is all part of the fun. We will see what happens out there [with Warner at Lord's during The Hundred, where they are playing for Trent Rockets and London Spirit respectively]. It is not really in my nature to get too verbal."PollWill Joe Root score a century in the Ashes series?Yes, definitelyNo, not likelyMaybe, depends on conditionsRoot's performance in Australia has been notable despite not scoring a century there. He has accumulated 892 runs in 14 Tests and 27 innings, maintaining an average of over 35 with nine half-centuries and a highest score of 89.The pre-series verbal exchanges between players from both teams are considered a common strategy to create psychological pressure before the matches begin.Both Root and Warner will face each other at Lord's during The Hundred tournament, where they represent Trent Rockets and London Spirit respectively, before the Ashes series begins.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

RR reportedly approached Chennai Super Kings, expressing interest in Ravindra Jadeja or Ruturaj Gaikwad in exchange for Samson, but CSK is unwilling to release these key players. Ruturaj Gaikwad, Sanju Samson and Ravindra Jadeja. The uncertainty over Sanju Samson’s future with Rajasthan Royals has grown, with fresh reports indicating that the franchise is actively working on potential trade options for their captain. As reported by Cricbuzz, RR have reached out to multiple IPL franchises to check if they are interested in acquiring the India wicketkeeper-batter. Lead owner Manoj Badale is said to be personally involved in the discussions. According to Cricbuzz, during these talks, Badale has even named specific players from other teams that the Royals would want in exchange for Samson. In the case of Chennai Super Kings, it is believed RR asked for either Ravindra Jadeja or Ruturaj Gaikwad as part of a swap. These demands are understood to be deal-breakers for CSK, who are not willing to release two of their most important players.What went wrong with CSK in IPL 2025Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Shivam Dube’s name has also been mentioned in some conversations, but Chennai are reportedly unwilling to part with the India all-rounder either. In fact, CSK officials are said to be reluctant to release any of their current players. This makes a direct swap between Samson and CSK seem unlikely at present, unless lengthy negotiations change the equation or Samson’s name comes up in the auction. However, there is no certainty that Samson will even enter the auction. RR are believed to be in serious trade talks with more than one team, and there is interest from several other franchises. This means another franchise could step in and finalise a deal before the auction stage. Samson, who has been with RR for several seasons and captained them in recent years, has reportedly made a formal request to the management for a move, stating that he wants to take his career in a new direction. Over the past seasons, there have been reports of differences between Samson and the team’s decision-makers.PollWhich player would you prefer to see swapped for Sanju Samson?Ravindra JadejaRuturaj GaikwadShivam DubeNone of the aboveOne point of tension was the Royals’ choice to release Jos Buttler before the last season while retaining Shimron Hetmyer. Samson had previously told Star Sports that letting Buttler go was one of the most difficult calls for him, and during a dinner with Buttler in the England series, he admitted he was still not over it. Despite these issues, Samson has avoided making any negative public comments about the franchise. In a recent podcast with R Ashwin, he said the Rajasthan Royals setup means a lot to him and spoke highly of Vaibhav Suryavanshi, the young left-handed batter who replaced him at the top of the order in the RR batting line-up. If a suitable trade does not materialise, Samson could still remain with Rajasthan Royals, as releasing or trading a player is entirely the franchise’s decision. The player’s role in this process is limited to making a formal request. For now, the situation remains open-ended, and it is clear that Samson’s next move will be one of the biggest talking points of the upcoming IPL off-season.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

SUBSCRIBE NOW! “No, I don’t think the quality was as good as ’05. I mean, I don’t think I’ll see a better series than the ’05 Ashes. One team on the rise, one great team on the decline, an emerging team with absolutely great players at the top of their game,” Atherton said on Sky Sports Cricket. He explained that while 2005 set an unmatched benchmark, this latest series stood out for its unpredictable nature. “I’d probably put this one as the best since ’05 because of those dramatic moments — like Chris Woakes, and Rishabh Pant, and the way the series twisted and turned. So I reckon it’s probably the best series I’ve covered since ’05,” he added.IND vs ENG: Mohammed Siraj reflects on memorable win at The Oval The five-match contest ended 2-2 after India sealed a tense victory in the final Test at The Oval. The last day saw wickets fall quickly and emotions run high in a fiercely fought battle between the two sides. In contrast, the 2005 Ashes, which is widely considered one of the greatest Test series in history, saw England edge Australia 2-1 to reclaim the urn for the first time since 1986-87. That series remains remembered for its high-quality cricket, nail-biting finishes and lasting impact on the sport.PollWhich series do you think had more dramatic moments?2025 India-England Series2005 Ashes SeriesWhile Atherton’s verdict doesn't place the series on par or better than the 2005 Ashes, he still placed the India-England clash in elite company.

Virat Kohli (AFP Photo) NEW DELHI: Former India captain Virat Kohli, who has retired from T20Is and Tests and now focuses solely on ODIs, is gearing up for the Australia series in October after the postponement of the Bangladesh ODI series in August.

SUBSCRIBE NOW!In the image shared on his Instagram story, Kohli was seen training with Gujarat Titans’ assistant coach Naeem Amin. “Thanks for helping out with the hit, brother. Always lovely to see you,” he wrote. A fan page later reposted the picture, hinting at Kohli’s preparation for the Australian ODIs — a post that received a like from Kohli’s official account.Both Kohli and Rohit Sharma continue to feature in ODIs after stepping away from T20Is and Tests. Rohit remains the ODI captain, while Kohli is still a central figure in the format. The BCCI, however, is treading carefully regarding their long-term ODI futures, with age emerging as a key discussion point. By the 2027 ODI World Cup, Rohit will be 40 and Kohli 39.Despite this, their combined ODI record — 83 centuries and over 25,000 runs — underscores their value to the team. While India have transitioned from relying on them in other formats, their impact in 50-over cricket remains significant. The Australia series, set for October 19–25, will be India’s next ODI assignment, with both veterans expected to play vital roles.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Asia Cup | Shubman Gill - BCCI's new poster boy should lead India in T20Is too
With Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma all but retired, the BCCI’s search for a new on-field leader and marketable face has turned to Shubman Gill. Already India’s Test captain, his growing brand value, T20I record, and leadership credentials make him a strong contender for the white-ball captaincy as well.

Already India’s Test captain, his growing brand value, T20I record, and leadership credentials make him a strong contender for the white-ball captaincy as well. London: India's captain Shubman Gill acknowledges the crowd after India won the fifth Test match against England, at The Oval cricket ground, in London, England. (PTI Photo/R Senthilkumar)(PTI08_04_2025_000309B) New Delhi: In the past few weeks, social media videos have been doing the rounds where Shubman Gill's dismissals in Test cricket and then his centuries in the recently concluded Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy have been heavily compared. The lyrics from the song "Kachha Ghada" by singer Rahgir have been used, and the line says: “Ye jo has rahi hai duniya, meri nakamiyon pe... kal ye marenge taali meri kahaniyon pe” (Those who are mocking me for my failures today will clap for my story tomorrow).Eyebrows were raised when he was appointed as India's Test captain, with legends of the game questioning his spot in the playing XI. He answered his critics with 754 runs, almost overhauling Sunil Gavaskar's all-time record, and was presented with a customised shirt and cap by the 'Little Master.'IND vs ENG: Shubman Gill on Oval thriller, Siraj's spell, and missing Rishabh Pant and Jasprit BumrahGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Shubman Gill, a Gen Z, used Karan Aujla's famous track Ghabru on his Insagram with the caption, “The storm only rattles those who aren't ready for it.” He answered all his critics in a very nonchalant way -- both with his bat and his captaincy.India's captain Shubman Gill celebrates after scoring a century on the final day of the fourth cricket test match between England and India at Emirates Old Trafford, Manchester, England, July 27, 2025.(AP Photo/Jon Super)England wicketkeeper-batter Jos Buttler, who played under Gill's captaincy at the Gujarat Titans, has called his style of leadership a combination of the “intensity” of Virat Kohli and the “more laid-back” approach of Rohit Sharma. Buttler was right -- Gill hassled England with intent and elegance.The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) took a gamble, and Shubman swiftly filled the void left by Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma -- two of its biggest modern-day giants.Gill is not only filling the void with runs and leadership but also in brand value, and has already become the darling of the broadcasters. The leap can be gauged by MRF's investment on legendary batters going from Sachin Tendulkar to Virat Kohli and now Gill in a deal estimated to be worth Rs 8-10 crore per year.Remember the Virat Kohli Cam and Rohit Sharma Cam that broadcasters added to keep fans glued? Shubman is their answer.The other poster boy of Indian cricket is Jasprit Bumrah, hands down the magician who wears many hats. But with his persistent back injury and workload management, he won't be playing all of India’s matches.The brand equationFrom a commercial standpoint, Kohli and Rohit weren’t just cricketers; they were multi-million-dollar brands. Their mere presence boosted television ratings, ticket sales, and sponsorship value. Broadcasters built campaigns around them. Sponsors tailored entire ad shoots to their availability. Losing both at once was always going to create a vacuum, and the BCCI’s marketing minds are well aware that a successor must be groomed not just on the field, but in the marketplace.With Shubman Gill, they have a young poster boy for the next generation. With his elegant strokeplay, calm demeanour, and youthful appeal, he has already become a favourite with advertisers.Suryakumar Yadav has an impressive track record as India’s full-time T20I captain after Rohit Sharma retired from the format following the 2024 T20 World Cup triumph. Under his leadership, India have won 17 out of 22 matches.New Delhi, Aug 8 (IANS) Former India wicketkeeper-batter Parthiv Patel believes Test skipper Shubman Gill answered all challenges and questions through his prolific run-scoring spree during the recently drawn Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy series against England.There is no question about Surya the T20I batter -- he can entertain the crowd. But can he fill stadiums?This is the question coach Gautam Gambhir, chief selector Ajit Agarkar, and top BCCI officials will have to answer during the Asia Cup squad selection, given that the T20 World Cup will be played at home. Will they extend the line of thought by giving Shubman the white-ball captaincy as well? It would also make life easier for coach Gambhir. No coach anywhere in the world would want to deal with different captains for different formats.Numbers don’t lieBy no means is Shubman Gill a dud in the T20I format.In 21 T20Is, his strike rate is close to 140, and with added responsibility, he can only flourish - as seen in England. His Test average was in the mid-30s before the start of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, and he ended up chasing Don Bradman's batting record. Gill has shown that he is someone who will not buckle under added responsibility; instead, he thrives on it.In the IPL, he captains Gujarat Titans. In the first season, he showed some vulnerability but bounced back in his second season as captain, guiding them to the playoffs.New Delhi, Aug 7 (IANS) After captaining India to a 2-2 Test series draw in England, Shubman Gill has been appointed as the captain of the North Zone squad for the upcoming Duleep Trophy, starting on August 28 in Bengaluru.Since moving to Titans from Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), Gill has risen immediately to the leadership group under then-captain Hardik Pandya. He was pivotal in Titans winning the IPL title in 2022 with 483 runs at the top. Next season, he responded with an 890-run season with a strike rate of 157.80. In the last three IPL seasons, his strike rates have been 158.80, 147.40, and 155.88.His childhood mentor Gurkeerat Singh Mann has explained how Gill worked on his power-hitting.“He has always been a traditional batter, who was told by his father that hitting in the air is a sin in cricket. But once he was tipped as not good enough for T20I cricket, he added that power game to his repertoire -- and now see the sixes he hits, all of them above 90m,” Mann told TimesofIndia.com.“Before he joined Gujarat Titans, he started training in an open net at the IS Bindra Stadium in Mohali. He wanted to make sure that he was hitting it long and big. He was not happy with the sixes falling just behind the ropes. He used to get miffed. But that tells you his hunger to improve,” he added.PollDo you believe Shubman Gill can fill the leadership void left by Kohli and Sharma?AbsolutelySomewhatNot reallyNot at allIf the BCCI takes the bait by making Gill captain for the Asia Cup, it will provide them with the opportunity to build a young, fearless side under a fresh leader -- a rare combination.With two giants gone and Bumrah’s appearances in internationals carefully rationed, Gill could be the steady, stylish, and strategic leader India needs -- one who can carry the team on the field and the brand off it. The stage is his; the time might just be now.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

'If they are saying so much to Sachin …': When Dravid took a cheeky dig at crowd criticism

The Asia Cup in UAE which could see them clash vs India thrice, provided both qualify for final, was meant to trigger hype and boost the broadcasters’ revenue. However, with Pakistan’s form and record vs India being so poor, one wonders how enthused cricket fans will be about what was a marquee match not too long ago India could meet Pakistan thrice in the Asia Cup that will be played in September in the UAE. The debate over whether India should face Pakistan in the upcoming Asia Cup has divided opinion across the country, reflecting ongoing discussions about one of cricket’s most storied rivalries.Proponents argue that an India–Pakistan clash should proceed, asserting that the intense rivalry significantly boosts revenues, adding substantially to the coffers like no other cricket match-up. They contend that India, often regarded as the subcontinent’s ‘big brother’, has a role in financially sustaining other cricket-playing nations.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Conversely, opponents maintain that engaging in cricket matches with a nation they were at war with merely months earlier is untenable. They argue that there is no compelling reason to schedule cricket fixtures while broader bilateral tensions between the two neighbours remain unresolved.Amidst this heated debate, a common understanding among fans persists that the India–Pakistan rivalry remains cricket’s most heated and eagerly anticipated encounter. However, this perception warrants re-examination.Is the rivalry still as fierce? India and Pakistan last contested a Test match 18 years ago. Over the past 15 years, they have played 16 One Day Internationals (ODIs), with India securing twelve victories, and thirteen T20 matches, of which India has won ten.A snapshot of Pakistan's win-loss record since the 2022 T20 World Cup. The International Cricket Council (ICC) marketed the India–Pakistan match as the premier clash at the T20 World Cup in the United States last year. In the tournament, Pakistan not only lost to India but also to the hosts and the minor team USA in the first round.On Tuesday, the West Indies achieved a comprehensive victory over Pakistan in the third ODI in Tarouba, bowling them out for a mere 92 runs, underscoring the team’s ongoing struggles. Apart from home and away wins against Bangladesh earlier this year, the national team’s ODI performances have been lacklustre over the past two years.These statistics resurface regularly. Considering that India and Pakistan could potentially meet three times in the Asia Cup – during the league stage, the Super Four, and potentially the final – one wonders if it will live up to its anticipated status.India will meet Pakistan on September 14 in the group stage of the Asia Cup 2025.From an economic perspective, the India–England and India–Australia fixtures have seen exponential growth in recent years. For instance, the recent Anderson–Tendulkar Trophy, a five-Test series, recorded the highest-ever viewership numbers for digital broadcasts. Furthermore, the 2017 Border–Gavaskar series in India, followed by the 2024 leg in Australia, have become the highest-grossing bilateral cricket events to date.For the India–Pakistan rivalry to achieve similar financial success, the quality of cricket between the two nations would need a significant improvement. The primary benefits of India participating in the Asia Cup are twofold: firstly, assured financial gains for cricket boards across the subcontinent through media rights revenue; secondly, fostering goodwill ahead of discussions when India hosts the 2026 T20 World Cup.India vs Pakistan in last 15 yearsODI Matches: 17India wins: 12Pakistan wins: 4No Result: 1T20I matches: 13India wins: 10Pakistan wins: 3With media rights revenues valued at approximately Rs 1,400 crore for three tournaments (plus approximately Rs 290 crore from ground rights), each cricket board is guaranteed a minimum of Rs 290 to 332 crore over six years – an outcome unattainable without India’s involvement. In the context of the T20 World Cup, media rights revenues are several times higher than those of the Asia Cup.Ultimately, it is the financial stakes of the India–Pakistan match that remain high, while on-field competitiveness has diminished to a mere myth.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Pakistan cricket team during the second ODI against West Indies. (ANI) Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali, among others, have raised concern about the team's chances in the Asia Cup after a harrowing defeat against West Indies in the third ODI. West Indies came from 0-1 down in the series to clinch it 2-1, ending a 34-year drought over the 1992 World Cup winners.In the third match, played in Tarouba, Pakistan managed only 92 runs while chasing a target of 295. The 202-run loss was Pakistan's fourth biggest loss in their ODI history."I pray India refuse to play against Pakistan in the Asia Cup, just like how they did at the World Championships of Legends. Itni buri tarah maarenge na vo, ki aapki soch hai," Basit Ali said on The Game Plan YouTube channel.Basit Ali further addressed the possibility of losing to Afghanistan, stating: "If we lose to Afghanistan, no one would care much in this country. But everyone goes mad the moment you lose to India."PollWill Pakistan's performance improve in the upcoming Asia Cup?Yes, they will bounce backNo, it will be more of the sameThe Pakistani batting order crumbled from the start of their chase, with three top-order wickets falling within the first three overs. Openers Saim Ayub and Abdullah Shafique, along with captain Mohammad Rizwan, were dismissed without scoring any runs.Star batter Babar Azam could only contribute 9 runs, while Salman Agha managed 30 runs before his dismissal. The entire innings concluded in just 29.2 overs, with West Indies bowler Jayden Seales delivering an exceptional performance, taking 6 wickets for 18 runs.The loss against West Indies came despite Pakistan's earlier success in the T20I series against the same opposition, which they won 2-1 under Salman Agha's leadership.The upcoming Asia Cup, scheduled to take place in the UAE, will be played in the T20 format, serving as preparation for next year's T20 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.Pakistan's T20 squad composition may differ from their ODI team, as neither Babar Azam nor Mohammad Rizwan participated in the successful T20I series against West Indies, a pattern that might continue in the Asia Cup.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

'Shouldn't have had a place': Irfan Pathan's brutal take on Rohit Sharma playing Test cricket in 2024
Irfan Pathan suggested that Rohit Sharma's place in the Test team was potentially in jeopardy during 2024 due to poor performances, particularly highlighting his struggles in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Pathan acknowledged the perception of biased support towards Sharma, and argued that he only kept his place in the squad because he was captain.

Pathan acknowledged the perception of biased support towards Sharma, and argued that he only kept his place in the squad because he was captain. Rohit Sharma retired from Tests in May (Image via Getty Images) Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has claimed that Rohit Sharma might have found it difficult to retain his place in the Test team during the latter half of 2024 had he not been the captain.Pathan recalled Rohit’s poor run during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia earlier that year. The opener averaged just 6.20 across three matches before opting out of the final Test in Sydney. “Rohit Sharma is an amazing player in white-ball cricket, but his average in Test cricket that year was 6, so we said that if he was not the captain, he would not have had a place in the team, and this is true,” Pathan said, speaking in a Lallantop video.IRFAN PATHAN FLYING FROM MUMBAI SPOTTED AT AIRPORTGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! At the time, Rohit addressed the decision in an interview with Pathan and Jatin Sapru during the match on January 5. “This is what I say. Stand down. I will say a few words, fifty words will be made out of it. So basically, runs are not coming from my bat, I am not in form, it is an important match, we need players in form, the boys in our batting are not in form, so you cannot carry too many out-of-form players in the team,” Rohit had explained. “It was difficult for me to take this decision but if everything is put in front of us, then this decision was sensible, and I will not think too much ahead. What the team needed at this time, this was the only thought, and there was no other thought apart from that,” he added. Pathan also addressed perceptions that he and others had been overly supportive of Rohit. “People say that we supported Rohit Sharma more than necessary. Of course, when someone comes to interview on your broadcasting channel, you will not misbehave with them, right? You have invited him, so you will behave politely… we had to show that, because he was our guest,” Pathan said.PollDo you think Rohit Sharma would have retained his place in the Test team if he wasn't captain?Yes, definitelyNo, he would have been dropped However, he maintained his stance on Rohit’s place in the side. “We had said that he should keep fighting, but that said, he should not have had a place in the playing XI. If he was not the captain of the team, he would have been dropped.” Rohit later rediscovered his touch in white-ball cricket, guiding India to the Champions Trophy title in March 2025, before retiring from Test cricket on May 7.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

India's Ravindra Jadeja  (AP/PTI) A lull in India’s cricketing calendar allows space and time for various stories to come out. With the country still delusional over the team’s thrilling six-run victory at The Oval to square the series against England 2-2, media reports emerged that Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, two batting stalwarts and players, who had already bid adieu to Tests and T20Is, could be playing in their last 50-over series Down Under in Oct.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! For fans of the two players, who were expected to bow out only after the 50-over World Cup in Oct-Nov 2027 in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia, it came as a shock. The fan clubs of the two players, always at war on social media, were united in grief after reading reports of their probable exit from ODIs as they directed their collective ire at chief selector Ajit Agarkar and coach Gautam Gambhir. While plenty was discussed about the white-ball futures of both Rohit and Virat and how unfair it was to make the two stalwarts go through the grind of playing Vijay Hazare Trophy and India A games to prove themselves, another cricketer might be skating on thin ice when it comes to his white-ball future.Ravindra Jadeja, the Saurashtra stalwart, might have had his best series as a batter in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy with 516 runs and six half-centuries, but his strike rate in ODIs has been a subject of debate as it has not been at par with the pace at which runs are scored in the format lately. In 204 ODIs, his 2,806 runs have been scored at a strike rate of 85.44. The fact that he has batted at No.7 or lower, a position where big-hitters walk in and target the boundaries, puts additional scrutiny on those numbers. In fact, in the 11 games that he has batted in at No.6, his average of 30 and strike rate of 81.44 also does not meet modern requirements. Jadeja’s last outing at that number was his laborious 22-ball 9 in the 2023 World Cup final at Ahmedabad, where he was strangely sent in ahead of Surya Kumar Yadav, curiously to inject some pace in the innings that had got stuck as KL Rahul and Virat Kohli erred on the side of caution while rebuilding the innings after India lost three wickets for 81 runs. Jadeja has batted at No.7 98 times in 148 matches and has scored 2,000 runs at 83.41. In 2023, that strike rate had dropped to 79.16. With the death overs of modern ODI batting requiring explosive skills, India would be justified in looking at someone with a wider range of strokes and greater power.PollWho do you think is more crucial for India’s ODI success moving forward?Ravindra JadejaAxar PatelWashington Sundar In Axar Patel, they probably have an ideal like-for-like replacement. The lanky Gujarat southpaw batted at No.5 in the 2024 T20 World Cup final against South Africa at Barbados, and, despite India stuttering at 34 for 3, belted a momentum-changing 31-ball 47 that allowed Kohli the freedom to drop anchor and bat deep. Axar was a floater in the batting order during the victorious campaign and had been used tactically, especially as a hitter against spin on the sluggish pitches in the Caribbean. On spin-friendly surfaces in the sub-continent, West Indies and Dubai, he has been used to break the monotony of right-handers following each other. In the Champions Trophy in the UAE, his 30-ball 27 in the semifinal against Australia and his 29, which included the tactical takedown of Mitchell Santner of New Zealand in the final, made the equation more comfortable for the lower order. Axar’s average of 22.37 may not appear earth-shattering, but the fact that he has scored those runs at 91.47 at crucial times makes him an attractive package in ODIs. In Indian victories, he has scored his runs at 97.97. Because his batting has come along wonderfully, Axar’s bowling is seldom discussed. Finger spinners, thanks to modern batting-friendly field restrictions and rules, have been reduced to cannon fodder. However, his fastish round-arm finger spin has cost India only 4.49 runs per over. He may not have had a five-wicket haul to show for his efforts yet in the 63 times he has bowled in ODIs, but that could be because he has completed his quota of 10 overs just 29 times in his career. His average (32.94) and strike rate (43.9) also make him a useful option. Jadeja, who has bowled in 196 innings in the 204 times he has played for India in the blue jersey, has picked up 231 scalps at 35.41 and an economy rate of 4.85. His strike rate of 43.7 is better, though, than Axar’s. What goes in favour of Axar is the fact that he often bowls in the powerplay in T20s and in the IPL and wouldn’t be averse to doing it in the ODIs too. The speed at which he bowls and the height at which the balls comes down makes charging at him difficult for batters. Both Jadeja and Axar are assets in the field. But India now also have another talented spin-bowling all-rounder in the form of Washington Sundar, who can strike it big in the end overs and is technically adept to bat in the top-6. The fact that he is still only 25, is a safe fielder and an excellent powerplay bowler, makes him an attractive option for captains and coaches to lend balance to the team and field a long batting order. Both Rohit and Virat probably lost the right to go to England because of a sustained poor run in Tests. In ODIs, though, their numbers have been excellent. It is only their age and the fact they would be 40 and 39 respectively when the 2027 ODI World Cup comes around that has made the management wary about picking them beyond Australia. Jadeja too would be close to 39 when the World Cup is staged in 2027.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

India's player of the series India's captain Shubman Gill (AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) Shubman Gill said being named ICC Men’s Player of the Month for July carried extra meaning as it came during his first Test series as India’s captain. Reflecting on the award, Gill said, “It feels great to be named the ICC Player of the Month for July. This time it holds a lot more significance since it has come for my performances during my first Test series as captain. The double ton in Birmingham is obviously something I’ll cherish forever and will be one of the highlights of my tour to England.”Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Gill’s numbers backed up his words. He was the standout performer in the Anderson Tendulkar Trophy, scoring 754 runs in 10 innings at an average of 75.40. July alone brought him 567 runs in three Tests at an average of 94.50, including three centuries and a career-best 269 at Edgbaston. That innings was not only a personal milestone but also the spark for India’s comeback after losing the series opener in Leeds.PollDo you believe Shubman Gill will continue to excel as India's captain in future series?Yes, definitelyProbablyUncertainNo, I don't think so His 430-run aggregate in Birmingham is one of the highest in Test history and the best by any visiting batter in England. Along the way, Gill surpassed Sunil Gavaskar’s record for most runs in a Test series as Indian captain and became the first Asian to score more than 700 runs in a series on English soil. While he had lean patches at Lord’s and The Oval, his earlier contributions ensured India finished the series 2-2. The award is Gill’s fourth, cementing his status as one of the game’s most consistent and impactful players.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

RR reportedly approached Chennai Super Kings, expressing interest in Ravindra Jadeja or Ruturaj Gaikwad in exchange for Samson, but CSK is unwilling to release these key players. Ruturaj Gaikwad, Sanju Samson and Ravindra Jadeja. The uncertainty over Sanju Samson’s future with Rajasthan Royals has grown, with fresh reports indicating that the franchise is actively working on potential trade options for their captain. As reported by Cricbuzz, RR have reached out to multiple IPL franchises to check if they are interested in acquiring the India wicketkeeper-batter. Lead owner Manoj Badale is said to be personally involved in the discussions. According to Cricbuzz, during these talks, Badale has even named specific players from other teams that the Royals would want in exchange for Samson. In the case of Chennai Super Kings, it is believed RR asked for either Ravindra Jadeja or Ruturaj Gaikwad as part of a swap. These demands are understood to be deal-breakers for CSK, who are not willing to release two of their most important players.What went wrong with CSK in IPL 2025Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Shivam Dube’s name has also been mentioned in some conversations, but Chennai are reportedly unwilling to part with the India all-rounder either. In fact, CSK officials are said to be reluctant to release any of their current players. This makes a direct swap between Samson and CSK seem unlikely at present, unless lengthy negotiations change the equation or Samson’s name comes up in the auction. However, there is no certainty that Samson will even enter the auction. RR are believed to be in serious trade talks with more than one team, and there is interest from several other franchises. This means another franchise could step in and finalise a deal before the auction stage. Samson, who has been with RR for several seasons and captained them in recent years, has reportedly made a formal request to the management for a move, stating that he wants to take his career in a new direction. Over the past seasons, there have been reports of differences between Samson and the team’s decision-makers.PollWhich player would you prefer to see swapped for Sanju Samson?Ravindra JadejaRuturaj GaikwadShivam DubeNone of the aboveOne point of tension was the Royals’ choice to release Jos Buttler before the last season while retaining Shimron Hetmyer. Samson had previously told Star Sports that letting Buttler go was one of the most difficult calls for him, and during a dinner with Buttler in the England series, he admitted he was still not over it. Despite these issues, Samson has avoided making any negative public comments about the franchise. In a recent podcast with R Ashwin, he said the Rajasthan Royals setup means a lot to him and spoke highly of Vaibhav Suryavanshi, the young left-handed batter who replaced him at the top of the order in the RR batting line-up. If a suitable trade does not materialise, Samson could still remain with Rajasthan Royals, as releasing or trading a player is entirely the franchise’s decision. The player’s role in this process is limited to making a formal request. For now, the situation remains open-ended, and it is clear that Samson’s next move will be one of the biggest talking points of the upcoming IPL off-season.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

He will have to take the surfboard off his front leg." The comment referenced Root's record against Hazlewood, who has dismissed him 10 times in 31 innings at an average of 31.40.Speaking to Sky Sports Root responded to Warner's comments with composure, saying: "Just that. I have no control over how people perceive the game or discuss it in an interview. Nothing new, is it? You know there are going to be storylines and people wanting to hype up a big series. Does not really change anything. It is sort of irrelevant to me. What can I do about it? Just make sure it is not a talking point in six months or 100 days' time."The English batter further added: "When you get out there, you have to got to try and impact the game and help your team get off to a good start. Business as usual as far as I am concerned. I guess it is all part of the fun.

Vincent Keymer (X) Chennai: Vincent Keymer has been an unstoppable force in Chennai and is showing no signs of slowing down. At the end of the seventh round, he remains untouchable, and that flawless run propelled him to the World No. 10 spot in live ratings for the first time. The German youngster (5.5 points) converted his opening advantage into a win against Awonder Liang and stretched his lead to 1.5 points, inching closer to the masters title. A better result than Arjun Erigaisi and Karthikeyan Murali — joint second on the table with four points — on the penultimate day could all but seal the title for him.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! After the win, Keymer said: “It has been a nice game and the tournament has been really going well for me. I got surprised by the opening and was down for quite a bit, but the game just developed. We reached a rather asymmetrical position which was probably slightly better for me. Then a big mistake from him made me feel it was a game I should win.” A few boards away, Anish Giri is making waves of a different kind. Seven draws in as many games, and the internet troll of ‘Drawnish Giri’ is doing the rounds again. Speaking after the stalemate with Arjun, who is down with flu, Anish said: “It’s (the troll) probably not entirely unfair because I am, again, making a lot of draws. It’s because I’m a very good defender. When I have a bad tournament, I often manage not to lose those bad games. Had I been a worse defender, I’d have lost a couple and nobody would be bullying me... so I’m happy with what I have.” The Dutch GM recalled one event where his defence faltered and the losses piled up. “At that moment I told myself: ‘never again will you be ungrateful and annoyed when you make all the draws’.”Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Healthy vegetation appears luminous, while rivers, marshes, and agricultural land stand out with remarkable clarity. Scientists use these images to monitor plant health, water distribution, and environmental changes over time. By revealing fine details of the landscape, near-infrared photography allows researchers to track the effects of climate change, urbanisation, and deforestation, providing crucial data to protect this vital ecosystem.Accompanying the image, Pettit described the region as “the largest river delta on Earth,” underscoring both its geographical significance and natural splendour. The photograph quickly drew admiration from scientists, nature lovers, and photography enthusiasts alike and was praised for blending technical precision with artistic expression.Beyond its scientific value, Pettit’s photograph has captured attention for its visual appeal. The glowing greenery, winding rivers, and patchwork of farmland create a composition that blends art and science seamlessly.

Pettit’s work highlights how space photography can inspire curiosity and appreciation for Earth’s landscapes, offering a perspective rarely seen from the ground.The Ganga-Brahmaputra delta: Asia’s largest river delta and vital biodiversity hotspotThe Ganga or Ganges delta, also called the Bengal Delta or Sundarbans Delta, covers more than 100,000 square kilometres and flows into the Bay of Bengal. It is home to millions who depend on its rich soils for agriculture, and it contains the UNESCO-listed Sundarbans mangrove forest. This unique ecosystem provides a habitat for endangered species like the Bengal tiger and supports biodiversity through its dense forests and interwoven waterways. Seasonal flooding replenishes nutrients in the soil, creating highly productive farmland, but also poses challenges for communities living in the delta.The Ganga river delta: Vital ecosystem and environmental stabilityThe Ganga river delta is not only vital for human livelihoods but also plays a crucial role in environmental stability. Its wetlands act as natural buffers against floods, while mangroves prevent coastal erosion and storm damage. These tools also assist in assessing biodiversity, identifying areas of habitat loss, and planning sustainable conservation efforts to protect both wildlife and local communities. Satellite and aerial imagery help scientists monitor these ecosystems, track seasonal flooding, and study the impact of climate change. Pettit’s near-infrared photograph contributes to this research by providing a detailed view of vegetation and land use, complementing other scientific tools used to safeguard the delta’s delicate balance.NASA astronaut Don Pettit’s near-infrared images of the Ganga river delta provide a striking perspective on one of the world’s most vital and expansive ecosystems. Covering over 100,000 square kilometres, the delta sustains millions of people, supports rich biodiversity, and safeguards coastal regions from natural disasters. Pettit’s work combines scientific observation with artistic vision, emphasising the importance of monitoring waterways, vegetation, and ecological health from space. Such imagery not only showcases the beauty and fragility of our planet but also inspires greater environmental awareness, highlighting the urgent need for conservation and fostering a deeper global appreciation of Earth’s natural landscapes.Also Read: NASA and Google collaborating together to develop AI medical assistant to boost astronaut health on Moon and Mars missionsAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

He was aided by Tiffany Fowler and Shae Saur. The stolen rocks were valued at $21 million. Roberts claimed it was for love, but the FBI found he planned to sell them. Roberts and his accomplices were arrested. The heist damaged scientific research. Source: LADbible In one of the most audacious and bizarre crimes in NASA history, Thad Roberts, a 24-year-old intern, stole moon rocks valued at $21 million in 2002, driven by romance rather than greed. Alongside his girlfriend Tiffany Fowler and fellow intern Shae Saur, Roberts executed a meticulously planned burglary at Houston’s Johnson Space Center, using authentic NASA badges, rewired security cameras, and Neoprene suits to bypass alarms. Their theft of 17 pounds of lunar samples included historic moon rocks from Apollo missions 1969–1972. While Roberts claimed the act was “for love,” the FBI revealed he had attempted to sell the rocks. This extraordinary heist destroyed priceless scientific research and shocked the world, blending science, crime, and obsession in an unforgettable story.$21 million moon rock theft at Johnson Space Center shocks scientists worldwideOn a July night in 2002, Roberts, Fowler, and Saur infiltrated Building 31 at Johnson Space Center. Roberts and Fowler donned Neoprene bodysuits, which allowed them to bypass thermal alarms, while Saur acted as a lookout. Using a power saw, they cracked open a 601-pound safe containing moon rocks and meteorites, including samples from every Apollo mission. The stolen lunar samples were worth approximately $21 million and represented decades of scientific research. The planning and execution demonstrated not only audacity but also technical sophistication, showing how a combination of insider knowledge and determination can circumvent the most secure facilities. Source: Live ScienceWho is Thad Roberts? From NASA Intern to mastermind behind the $21 million moon rock theftThad Roberts graduated from the University of Utah with a triple degree in physics, geology, and geophysics, making him highly qualified to work at NASA. He met Tiffany Fowler, a 22-year-old stem cell researcher, and the couple quickly became romantically involved. Roberts reportedly told Fowler he wanted to “give her the moon,” framing the theft as a grand romantic gesture. According to People.com , the FBI considered financial motives, Roberts maintained that the act symbolized devotion rather than profit.Moon rock theft ends with FBI arrests and millions in NASA lunar samples lostRoberts and Fowler’s motivation went beyond romance—they symbolically “had sex on the moon” by placing stolen lunar samples under a blanket during intimate moments. Roberts later stated, “No one had ever had sex on the moon before,” underscoring the bizarre, almost surreal nature of the crime. While Roberts claimed love was the driving factor, the FBI discovered he had negotiated with a Belgian buyer willing to pay up to $5,000 per gram, proving the theft had financial implications.The heist came to a dramatic end when Roberts and Fowler traveled to Orlando to meet the potential buyer, only to be apprehended by undercover FBI agents. Saur and Gordon McWhorter, who helped arrange the sale, were arrested shortly afterward. The investigation revealed that the theft had caused irreversible damage: the moon rocks were now “virtually useless to the scientific community,” and three decades of NASA research notes were destroyed as reported.Moon rock theft from NASA leads to jail, house arrest, and finesThad Roberts pleaded guilty to the theft of moon rocks and other NASA artifacts, serving over six years of an eight-year prison sentence before his release in 2008. Tiffany Fowler and Shae Saur received house arrest, community service, and were required to pay restitution to NASA. Gordon McWhorter was convicted at trial for his involvement in the theft and sentenced to six years in prison.Also Read | NASA and Google collaborating together to boost astronaut health on Moon and Mars missionsAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Bermuda Triangle ‘mystery’ solved? Scientist explains the real cause behind vanishings of ships and planes
The Bermuda Triangle's infamous reputation for unexplained disappearances is largely unfounded, according to scientist Karl Kruszelnicki and supported by NOAA and Lloyd's of London. The region's high traffic volume, combined with challenging environmental conditions like the Gulf Stream and frequent storms, accounts for the incidents. Human error and equipment failure also play significant roles, debunking myths of supernatural forces.

The region's high traffic volume, combined with challenging environmental conditions like the Gulf Stream and frequent storms, accounts for the incidents. Human error and equipment failure also play significant roles, debunking myths of supernatural forces. Image: Getty Images  For decades, the Bermuda Triangle, the stretch of ocean roughly bounded by Miami, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico, has been the subject of mystery, fear, and speculation. From tales of ships vanishing without a trace to aircraft disappearing mid-flight, the region has inspired theories about supernatural forces, alien abductions, and even time warps. But according to Australian scientist Karl Kruszelnicki, backed by research from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Lloyd’s of London, these myths do not hold up. Far from being a cursed zone, the Bermuda Triangle’s so-called mysteries can be explained by natural environmental conditions, human error, and statistical probability. The truth, Kruszelnicki emphasizes, is far less otherworldly and far more rooted in the realities of nature and navigation.Bermuda Triangle poses no greater risk than other oceansKruszelnicki, supported by NOAA and Lloyd’s of London, has long maintained that the Bermuda Triangle is no more dangerous than any other ocean region. Disappearances occur at roughly the same proportional rate as elsewhere in the world’s waters. As noted by Kruszelnicki, the higher number of incidents is largely due to the Triangle being one of the busiest shipping and flight corridors in the world, where heavy traffic naturally means more recorded accidents. Statistical data confirms that when the volume of vessels and aircraft is taken into account, the accident rate is completely ordinary. This directly challenges the very foundation of the Triangle’s mythical reputation.Environmental and navigational challenges of 'Bermuda Triangle'According to Kruszelnicki, the geography and weather patterns of the Bermuda Triangle create conditions that can challenge even experienced navigators. The Gulf Stream, a powerful ocean current, can cause sudden changes in weather, generate violent storms, and push vessels off course within minutes. The region is also prone to tropical storms, hurricanes, waterspouts, and rogue waves that can overwhelm ships and planes without warning. Numerous islands and coral reefs make for hazardous, shallow navigation routes, increasing the risk of grounding or collision. Kruszelnicki also points out that certain areas experience magnetic anomalies where compasses may point to true north instead of magnetic north, leading to potential navigation errors. Furthermore, unpredictable microbursts and rapidly forming squalls can make navigation extremely hazardous, even for experienced crews. Sudden changes in visibility and wind patterns have historically contributed to numerous near-miss incidents in the area. When all these factors combine, even a minor miscalculation can turn deadly.Human error and equipment failureAs Kruszelnicki explains, a significant number of accidents in the Bermuda Triangle can be traced to pilot or captain mistakes, faulty equipment, or outdated forecasting methods. These human and technical shortcomings often occur alongside the already challenging weather and navigational conditions of the region. In earlier decades, limited communication systems and slower emergency response times meant that vessels or aircraft in trouble had little chance of rescue. Even today, with advanced technology, mistakes and malfunctions can quickly escalate into disasters when compounded by sudden storms or rough seas. Kruszelnicki stresses that the human factor is often underestimated in popular explanations of the Triangle’s incidents.Origins of the myth of the Bermuda Triangle The term “Bermuda Triangle” was first coined in 1963 by writer Vincent Gaddis, who linked the region to a series of unexplained disappearances. His writings sparked public curiosity, but the myth gained massive momentum in 1974 when author Charles Berlitz published a bestselling book that embellished these stories with speculation about Atlantis, alien abductions, and other sensational claims. Kruszelnicki has often criticized such accounts for their lack of credible evidence and reliance on anecdotal storytelling. The entertainment value of the myth overshadowed scientific explanations, cementing its place in pop culture for generations despite the absence of verifiable proof.Famous anecdote – the Bruce Gernon storyIn 1970, pilot Bruce Gernon reported encountering a strange tunnel-like cloud while flying through the Bermuda Triangle. He claimed his instruments malfunctioned, and upon exiting the cloud, he experienced a time discrepancy of about 30 minutes. The story has been widely discussed in books, documentaries, and paranormal circles, with some suggesting it could be evidence of a time warp. Kruszelnicki, however, remains skeptical, noting that the account is anecdotal and lacks corroborating evidence. Many experts, including Kruszelnicki, believe it could be explained by meteorological phenomena such as unusual cloud formations or optical illusions.Scientific consensus over Bermuda TriangleThe conclusion from NOAA, the US Navy, and Lloyd’s of London — all echoed by Kruszelnicki — is clear: the Bermuda Triangle is not more hazardous than any other heavily traveled ocean region. The so-called mystery is a product of natural hazards, geographic challenges, human mistakes, and decades of exaggerated storytelling. Statistically, the accident rates are consistent with those in other busy maritime and aviation areas. While the legend of the Bermuda Triangle may continue to inspire curiosity and creativity, the evidence, as Kruszelnicki emphasizes, points to a reality grounded in science, not the supernatural. Ultimately, the Bermuda Triangle’s greatest power lies not in sinking ships, but in captivating imaginations. It is a reminder that mystery often thrives where facts are overlooked, and that reality can be just as fascinating as myth.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

This ancient water, isolated for millennia, provides unprecedented insights into Earth's early conditions and potential for life in extreme environments. Professor Barbara Sherwood Lollar's team's findings challenge existing assumptions and open new avenues for astrobiological research.  In 2016, scientists discovered the oldest water on Earth deep within a Canadian mine, estimated to be over 2 billion years old. This rare water had been trapped underground, isolated from surface influences, offering unique insights into Earth’s ancient geological past and extreme environments. Professor Barbara Sherwood Lollar and her team made this remarkable discovery in the Kidd Creek Mine in Ontario, Canada. The water's extraordinary age and composition have important implications for understanding subterranean ecosystems and the possibility of life in harsh conditions, including on other planets.This finding marks a groundbreaking moment in geology and astrobiology, revealing how Earth’s deepest waters can hold secrets from billions of years ago.Discovery of the oldest water on Earth in Kidd Creek MineThe oldest water on Earth was uncovered at a depth of about 3 kilometers in the Kidd Creek Mine, Ontario. This water had remained sealed away for roughly 1.5 to 2.6 billion years, surpassing previous finds of ancient water worldwide. The research team, led by geologist Barbara Sherwood Lollar, tested the water’s age using isotopic analysis, confirming its unprecedented age. The longevity and isolation of this water make it a living snapshot of early Earth conditions, preserved untouched for billions of years.This groundbreaking discovery and detailed scientific analysis were published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications in 2014, offering a comprehensive look at the water’s age, chemistry, and significance. The findings challenge previous assumptions about Earth’s hydrological cycles and open new questions about the movement and preservation of water in the planet’s deep crust.Scientific importance of the oldest water on earth discoveryFinding the oldest water on Earth has major scientific significance. It offers clues about how microbial life could survive in isolated environments for billions of years, far from sunlight. This challenges previous assumptions about life’s limits on Earth and extends hope for discovering life in similar extraterrestrial environments, such as Mars or icy moons like Europa. The high salinity and unique chemical composition of this ancient water also provide insight into geological processes that occurred billions of years ago. These findings expand our understanding of Earth’s deep biosphere and the resilience of life. Moreover, studying such ancient water helps scientists understand how life might adapt to extreme conditions, pushing the boundaries of astrobiology and earth sciences.Tasting the oldest water on earth: A geologist’s unique experienceIn a remarkable gesture, Professor Sherwood Lollar tasted the oldest water on Earth herself. She described the water as “very salty and bitter,” much saltier than seawater. Geologists sometimes taste groundwater to gauge mineral content, and this personal experience highlighted the unique chemical environment preserved in the water. The high salinity reflects mineral concentration accumulated over billions of years underground.This firsthand encounter added a human dimension to the groundbreaking scientific discovery and underscored the curiosity and dedication behind such research. It also gave the public a tangible connection to this ancient, isolated water source, sparking greater interest in geology and Earth’s hidden history.Unlocking Earth’s ancient secrets through the oldest waterThe discovery of the oldest water on Earth deep within Canada’s Kidd Creek Mine offers an extraordinary window into our planet’s distant past. Trapped for billions of years, this ancient water not only enriches our understanding of Earth’s geological history but also fuels exciting possibilities about life in extreme environments beyond our planet. Professor Barbara Sherwood Lollar’s groundbreaking research continues to inspire scientists worldwide, reminding us that Earth still holds many hidden mysteries waiting to be uncovered beneath our feet.Also read| New study finds 117-million-year-old geological formations rewriting Atlantic Ocean historyAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Woman astronomer paid 30 cents an hour: unlocked cosmic distances; still missed out on Nobel Prize
Henrietta Swan Leavitt worked as a Harvard “computer” earning just 30 cents an hour, yet her groundbreaking discovery of the period-luminosity relationship transformed astronomy.

Her work enabled scientists to measure cosmic distances and understand the expanding universe. Despite this monumental contribution, Leavitt never received a Nobel Prize during her lifetime, highlighting the challenges faced by women in science.  Henrietta Swan Leavitt, an American astronomer whose groundbreaking discovery revolutionized how we measure the cosmos. Born in 1868, Leavitt began working at the Harvard College Observatory at a time when women were excluded from operating telescopes and instead employed as “computers” to analyze astronomical data. Despite earning just 30 cents an hour, her dedication and meticulous research led to one of the most important astronomical breakthroughs of the 20th century.In 1908, Leavitt discovered the period-luminosity relationship of Cepheid variable stars, showing a direct link between their brightness and pulsation period. This discovery became the key to measuring vast cosmic distances and ultimately helped astronomers like Edwin Hubble prove that the universe is expanding. Yet, despite her monumental contributions, Leavitt was never awarded a Nobel Prize during her lifetime.The discovery that changed astronomy foreverLeavitt’s key insight came from studying Cepheid variable stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, a galaxy assumed to be at a uniform distance from Earth. By carefully analyzing photographic plates, she found that the brightness of these stars varied in a predictable way tied to their pulsation period: the longer the period, the brighter the star. This relationship, now known as Leavitt’s Law, gave astronomers a powerful “standard candle,” an object of known brightness that can be used to calculate distances in space.Using this standard candle method, astronomers could measure how far away these stars and by extension, the galaxies they reside in actually were. This was a breakthrough in cosmic distance measurement, allowing scientists to determine the scale of the universe with unprecedented accuracy. Leavitt’s discovery became the foundation for Edwin Hubble’s later work in the 1920s where he used Cepheid variables to prove that the Milky Way was just one of many galaxies and that the universe itself was expanding.Overcoming barriers as a woman in scienceHenrietta Swan Leavitt’s career unfolded during a time when women faced serious discrimination in science. Women were largely relegated to supportive roles and denied opportunities such as telescope operation and academic recognition. Leavitt was paid a modest wage of about 30 cents an hour as a “computer” at Harvard, tasked with analyzing star data rather than conducting independent research.Despite these limitations, she showed extraordinary focus and persistence. Leavitt’s progressive hearing loss later in life made her work even more challenging, yet she continued her observations and calculations until her untimely death at the age of 53. Tragically, although her work was foundational for modern astronomy, she never received the Nobel Prize or equivalent accolades during her lifetime, and a posthumous nomination was not permitted.Legacy and lasting impact on cosmologyLeavitt’s period-luminosity relationship remains one of the cornerstones of astrophysics. It revolutionized the way distances to faraway celestial objects are measured, enabling astronomers to map the universe on a grand scale. This method underpins modern cosmology, helping scientists determine not only distances but also the rate at which the universe is expanding, key to the Big Bang theory.Edwin Hubble famously used Leavitt’s discovery to measure the distances to galaxies beyond the Milky Way and uncover the expanding nature of the universe, a milestone that forever changed humanity’s understanding of our place in the cosmos. Today, Henrietta Swan Leavitt is celebrated as a pioneering figure in astronomy whose brilliance and perseverance overcame societal and physical obstacles, leaving a profound legacy that continues to guide scientific exploration.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

These magnetic nanobots address tooth sensitivity. CalBots seal dentinal tubules using a bioceramic formula. Tests on extracted teeth show promising results. Animal trials demonstrate complete behavioral recovery. The team sees this as a step towards advanced nanorobotics. This innovation offers lasting relief for millions. The CalBots are made from safe materials.  BENGALURU: For millions of people, the sudden, sharp pain of tooth sensitivity can turn a sip of cold water into a jolt. Now, researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), in collaboration with Bengaluru-based deep-tech startup Theranautilus, have engineered “CalBots” – magnetic nanobots that can seal the problem at its source.As per IISc, CalBots are 400-nanometre particles loaded with a calcium silicate-based bioceramic formula, designed to travel deep inside dentinal tubules, the tiny tunnels in the tooth that lead to nerve endings. Guided by an external magnetic field, the bots can penetrate up to 500 micrometres into the tubules and self-assemble into stable, cement-like plugs that recreate the tooth’s natural barrier. One application, the team says, can offer lasting relief.Dental hypersensitivity affects nearly one in four people worldwide and occurs when enamel erosion or gum recession exposes the dentine layer beneath, IISc said. The tubules in dentine act as direct pathways to the nerves, which is why even mild temperature changes can trigger pain. “We didn’t want to create a slightly better version of what’s already out there. We wanted a technology that solves a real problem in a way that no one’s attempted before,” Shanmukh Peddi, postdoctoral researcher at IISc’s Centre for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE) and co-founder of Theranautilus. The team used a completely new class of bioceramic cement for the nanobots. While bioceramics are common in orthopaedics and dentistry, the formulation was designed specifically for hypersensitivity – to travel deeper and last longer.To test the approach, they worked first on extracted human teeth. “On these samples, we applied CalBots under a magnetic field for 20 minutes, during which the bots sealed the dentinal tubules by forming deep, stable plugs – a result confirmed through high-resolution imaging,” Peddi said.They then moved to animal trials, inducing sensitivity in mice and tracking their drinking behaviour. “Healthy mice drank both cold and room temperature water equally. But sensitive mice completely avoided cold water. After treatment, they started drinking it again. We saw 100% behavioural recovery. That was a big moment for us,” he said.The CalBots are made entirely from materials classified as ‘Generally Recognised as Safe’ and passed toxicity tests in mice. “This is a compelling demonstration of what nanorobotics can achieve, and how they could significantly impact future healthcare,” said Ambarish Ghosh, professor at CeNSE and one of the study’s corresponding authors.Debayan Dasgupta, former PhD student at CeNSE and co-founder of Theranautilus, sees this as part of a bigger technological shift. “We’ve created a regenerative, active nanomaterial – a step towards the kind of ‘tiny mechanical surgeons’ Richard Feynman once envisioned,” he said.Peddi added: “This is something we’ve worked towards silently for years. And the fact that we’ve done it here, in India, makes us very happy.”About the AuthorChethan KumarChethan Kumar is a Senior Assistant Editor with the Times of India.

It is an interstellar object moving at 209,000 km/h. Hubble images show it is smaller than thought, about 5.6 km wide. It is a comet with a glowing tail. Scientists estimate it is eight billion years old. It poses no threat to Earth. NASA uses telescopes to study it.  NASA has revealed exciting new information about a mysterious interstellar object called 3I/ATLAS, speeding through our solar system at extraordinary velocities. First detected on July 1, this visitor from beyond our star system has fascinated scientists globally with its astonishing speed of 130,000 miles per hour and intriguing characteristics. Recent observations from the Hubble Space Telescope have captured the clearest images to date, offering key insights into its size, makeup, and path. These discoveries represent a significant advancement in our understanding of these rare travelers crossing the galaxy into our cosmic neighborhood.NASA confirms 3I/ATLAS as the fastest interstellar object ever detectedNASA’s Hubble Space Telescope observations have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is travelling through our solar system at an extraordinary speed of 130,000 miles per hour (209,000 km/h), making it the fastest interstellar object ever recorded. This speed far exceeds that of previous interstellar visitors such as ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. Scientists explain that the object’s velocity is the result of billions of years of gravitational interactions, known as the “gravitational slingshot effect,” where passing stars, planets, and nebulae impart additional momentum to the comet. This extreme speed means the object is only briefly visible as it races through, providing a fleeting window of opportunity for study. NASA’s continuous monitoring aims to capture as much data as possible during its swift passage.Image: Daily MailSize estimates refined: NASA reveals 3I/ATLAS is smaller but still immenseInitial observations by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory suggested that 3I/ATLAS’s icy core might be around seven miles (11.2 km) wide. However, NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has now refined these estimates, revealing that the core is smaller — at most 3.5 miles (5.6 km) across, and possibly as little as 1,000 feet (320 meters) in diameter. Despite being smaller than first believed, this still makes 3I/ATLAS the largest interstellar object ever discovered, dwarfing the next largest known visitor by up to 14 times. The high-resolution images also highlight the comet’s glowing gas halo, which had made it appear larger in earlier, less detailed observations. Understanding the true size helps scientists model its composition and behavior as it interacts with solar radiation.NASA confirms 3I/ATLAS’s cometary nature and its spectacular glowing tailThanks to NASA’s powerful telescopes, scientists have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is not a solid rock but a comet — a chunk of ice, frozen gases, and dust surrounded by a halo of evaporating material. The Hubble images reveal a dust plume streaming from the side of the comet heated by the Sun, along with a faint tail trailing behind it. This tail is formed as the comet’s surface warms up, causing ice to vaporize and release gas and dust into space, creating the characteristic glowing appearance. This phenomenon is similar to that seen in comets within our solar system, but 3I/ATLAS’s interstellar origin and extreme speed make it a rare and valuable subject for study. NASA expects the tail and dust plume to become more pronounced as the object approaches its closest point to the Sun.Ancient traveler: NASA estimates 3I/ATLAS is twice as old as our solar systemOne of the most astonishing revelations from NASA’s studies is the estimated age of 3I/ATLAS. Scientific analysis suggests this object has been orbiting the Milky Way for at least eight billion years — roughly twice the age of our own 4.6 billion-year-old solar system. This implies 3I/ATLAS formed long before our Sun and planets came into existence, making it a true cosmic relic. Its journey through the galaxy has likely included multiple gravitational encounters with stars and interstellar clouds, which may have shaped its trajectory and speed. Studying such an ancient object offers scientists a unique glimpse into the conditions and materials present in the early universe and helps refine models of galactic evolution.Safe passage confirmed by NASA: No threat to EarthDespite its immense speed and close approach to the Sun, NASA has assured the public that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth. The comet will reach its closest point to the Sun in late October, passing just inside the orbit of Mars at about 130 million miles (210 million kilometers). Crucially, it will be on the opposite side of the Sun relative to Earth during this time, ensuring no risk of collision or gravitational disturbance. NASA continues to monitor the comet’s trajectory precisely, as the interaction with the Sun’s heat may slightly alter its path. After passing the Sun, 3I/ATLAS will head back out into interstellar space, continuing its long journey through the galaxy.A new era of discovery: NASA leads the charge in interstellar object research3I/ATLAS marks only the third confirmed interstellar object ever detected, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. NASA’s advancements in telescope technology, sky surveys, and space observatories like Hubble have ushered in a new era of interstellar discovery. Researchers expect that as survey instruments become more sensitive and comprehensive, the frequency of detecting such visitors will increase. NASA plans to utilize not only Hubble but also the James Webb Space Telescope, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory to study 3I/ATLAS in multiple wavelengths. This coordinated effort will deepen our understanding of the composition, origin, and behavior of interstellar objects and their role in the cosmic ecosystem.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

These massive structures, sculpted by ancient underwater avalanches, indicate the Atlantic Ocean connected earlier than previously thought. This discovery provides insights into Cretaceous climate shifts and tectonic movements, offering crucial data for modern geology and climate science.  Buried nearly a kilometre beneath the Atlantic seabed west of Guinea-Bissau lies a geological time-capsule: gigantic 117-million-year-old mud waves sculpted by dense, underwater avalanches. A new study published in Global and Planetary Change reveals that these ancient structures were formed when early Atlantic waters carved through the Earth’s crust, much earlier than previously believed. This discovery reshapes our understanding of Atlantic Ocean formation, offers fresh perspectives on Cretaceous climate shifts, and provides clues to tectonic movements that governed our planet’s evolving geography. From deep-sea sediment patterns to global carbon cycles, these mud waves, once hidden, now tell a story with far-reaching implications for modern geology and climate science.Underwater mud waves push the Atlantic's birth date back to 117 million years agoRecent research published in Global and Planetary Change (2025) by Duarte, Nicholson, and colleagues has shed new light on the early history of the Atlantic Ocean. Using a combination of modern seismic imaging and archived drilling data from 1975, the team identified a series of massive 117-million-year-old mud waves buried deep beneath the Atlantic seafloor. These geological giants, stretching over a kilometer in length and rising hundreds of meters high, were formed when dense, salty water from the young North Atlantic spilled into the deeper southern basins, creating powerful underwater currents. The composition and layering of these mud waves reveal that such flows occurred far earlier than previously believed, suggesting that the Equatorial Atlantic Gateway, the oceanic passage linking the northern and southern Atlantic opened sooner than most geological models predicted. This pushes back the estimated timeline of when the Atlantic became a fully connected ocean, making the discovery a crucial piece in reconstructing Earth’s plate tectonic and oceanographic history. Not only does this finding refine our understanding of how and when the Atlantic took shape, but it also offers insights into the role of deep-water currents in shaping the seafloor over millions of years.Sediment patterns illuminate early ocean currents and climate changeThe formation of these 117-million-year-old mud waves was far more than an isolated ocean-floor event, it represented a profound turning point in Earth’s climate and geological history. When the young North Atlantic’s saline waters finally breached into the long-isolated southern basins, they encountered dense, carbon-rich deep waters that had been locked away for millions of years. This sudden mixing unleashed colossal underwater mud avalanches, cascading across the seabed with immense force and reshaping the ocean floor’s topography on a scale rarely seen in Earth’s past.The consequences reached far beyond the geology. This tectonic–oceanic upheaval likely interrupted one of the planet’s most important climate-regulating processes: the long-term burial of carbon in marine sediments. By disturbing these ancient, carbon-heavy layers, the event may have kept vast amounts of greenhouse gases circulating in the atmosphere, helping sustain the elevated global temperatures characteristic of the mid-Cretaceous, a period often referred to as one of Earth’s “greenhouse worlds.” Such persistent warmth not only influenced ocean chemistry and circulation but also shaped the evolution and distribution of marine life for millions of years afterward.Understanding precisely when the Equatorial Atlantic Gateway opened is therefore critical. It marks the moment the Atlantic transitioned from a series of isolated basins into a fully connected ocean, altering heat and nutrient flows on a global scale. By reconstructing this event, scientists can better model ancient ocean currents, climate feedback loops, and the deep-time mechanisms that still echo in today’s climate system. In essence, these mud waves are not just relics of a vanished seafloor, they are a geological signature of the forces that have shaped, and continue to shape, Earth’s climate trajectory.Why this discovery matters: from paleoceanography to climate modellingKnowing that the Atlantic began to take shape around 117 million years ago, evidence preserved in those colossal buried mud waves, significantly sharpens scientists’ ability to model ancient ocean behaviour, tectonic shifts, and climate feedback loops. This revised timeline offers a clearer window into how early ocean gateways controlled the movement of heat across the planet, regulated carbon sequestration in marine sediments, and set the stage for long-term cooling or warming trends.By tracing these deep-time processes, researchers can better understand the intricate relationship between ocean circulation and Earth’s climate system. Crucially, such knowledge is not confined to the past, it provides a framework for anticipating the effects of today’s oceanic changes. From accelerating polar ice melt to shifting global currents, the same mechanisms that once shaped the Cretaceous world could, in altered form, dictate the trajectory of our future climate.Also read| Study reveals nature's hardest teeth: Chitons inspire future material designAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Although there is still no specific therapeutic medicine, a vaccine has been developed and approved for use in certain parts of the world, but no licensed or approved dengue vaccines are available in India, a high-incidence country.Led by Sweden’s Karolinska Institute, the project involves researchers from eight European universities, five Indian institutions, a university from the US, and an NGO from Guatemala, all working in the field of public healthcare and medical research.The total project cost is estimated to be around Rs 90 crore. The EU has already sanctioned Euro 8 million (nearly Rs 81 crore). The balance will be funded by the Govt of India through the Dept of Biotechnology, Ujjwal Neogi, the coordinator for the project, also a senior lecturer at Karolinska Institute, told TOI.The EU partners are collaborating with several leading institutes in India that include Artemis Hospital and Max Hospital in New Delhi, Kasturba Medical College Hospital in Mangalore, Regional Centre for Biotechnology, Faridabad. The India part is being led by National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani in West Bengal. “We’re bringing together the brightest minds from Europe and India to understand the disease at a molecular level and design better tools for diagnosis and prevention,” Neogi from Karolinska Institute said.Stockholm-based Karolinska Institute is a 215-year-old world-leading medical research university that every year selects the Nobel Prize winner in physiology or medicine.The project has a dual objective. Primarily, it aims at better understanding the complete lifecycle of dengue infection: From the origin of the virus, to how it spreads in human beings to how it affects the human body. And then to come out with solutions so that the spread of this mosquito-induced disease could be contained, its impacts on human beings could be predicted during the early onset of the disease, and could be cured more effectively and quickly than now.With an estimated 100 million infections annually across 144 countries leading to over 10,000 deaths, this predominantly tropical disease is now spreading in Europe, mainly due to climate change, the project’s website noted.Another equally important objective of the project is to better understand how, in general, virus-induced pandemics spread and to prepare a blueprint for countering such incidents in future. The secondary objective of the project grew in importance in the backdrop of the Covid-induced global pandemic, researchers working in the project told TOI.From India’s side, the partners will make “original research contributions to the overall objectives of the program, that is pioneering innovative antiviral strategies to alleviate the burden of dengue infection while deepening our understanding of its complex pathogenesis through cutting-edge multi-modal technologies,” said Arindam Maitra, Professor, National Institute of Biomedical Genomics. Maitra is the chief coordinator for the researchers in India involved in this project.“The Indian team will collect, clinically characterize, undertake viral and host multiomics investigations to identify key factors facilitating severe disease and undertake research to come up with antiviral and immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies (that can regulate body's immune response) in collaboration with the EU team.” The ‘multiomics investigations’ here refer to an integrated data analysis of various DNA and RNA molecules within a dengue-infected person to identify novel biomarkers and improve disease classification.According to Neogi, among various cutting-edge research techniques, the project will use the brain-on-chip process. This is a relatively new research technique that simulates a human brain’s functions under a controlled environment in a laboratory. The researchers would be using the brain-on-chip process to see what happens to a human brain when the dengue virus infects the body. They expect the same technique could also give them some idea about combating the virus that is spread through mosquitoes. The technology will be transferred to India from the EU partners.About the primary takeaways for India from this project, Maitra said that given the increasing occurrence of severe disease and death following dengue virus infection in India and other parts of the globe, “this research initiative is expected to provide information and solutions which have the potential to play a major role in combating this challenge.”About the AuthorPartha SinhaPartha, senior assistant editor (markets) at The Times of India, Mumbai, covers the financial markets, mainly the stock market, mutual funds, banking and insurance sectors.

CMO-DA has shown promising results in simulated medical cases, achieving high diagnostic accuracy. This technology aims to provide reliable healthcare guidance in the challenging environment of deep space, potentially transforming healthcare worldwide. Source: Google Cloud As human space missions venture farther into deep space, the challenge of maintaining crew health grows increasingly complex. Unlike current missions aboard the International Space Station (ISS), where astronauts rely heavily on constant communication with Earth-based medical teams, regular medication supplies, and the option to return within six months, future journeys to the Moon, Mars, and beyond demand greater medical self-sufficiency. NASA and Google have teamed up to develop a breakthrough solution: an AI-powered medical assistant designed to support astronauts autonomously during extended spaceflight.NASA calls for AI medical assistant to support astronauts on Moon and Mars missionsWith missions extending beyond low Earth orbit, astronauts will face significant hurdles in healthcare management. Presently, ISS crews benefit from:Continuous real-time communication with ground-based medical expertsRoutine delivery of medicines and medical suppliesEvacuation options within months if medical emergencies ariseHowever, for lunar and Mars expeditions, communication delays can stretch up to 20 minutes each way, resupply missions will be infrequent, and emergency returns could take months or years. This scenario creates a pressing need for onboard medical autonomy, enabling astronauts to diagnose and treat health issues without immediate Earth-based assistance.Source: NASANASA and Google collaboration: Developing the Crew Medical Officer Digital Assistant (CMO-DA)To meet these challenges, NASA has partnered with Google to create the Crew Medical Officer Digital Assistant (CMO-DA) — an AI-driven medical tool designed for autonomous use by astronauts. This digital assistant is intended to serve as a virtual healthcare provider in space, bridging the gap when a medical doctor is not present onboard and communication with Earth is limited or delayed.Key features of CMO-DA:Multimodal Interface: Allows interaction via speech, text, and image inputs to facilitate easy use in space conditions.Cloud-Based Infrastructure: Operates within Google Cloud’s Vertex AI environment, enabling continuous application development and AI model training.Collaborative AI Model Development: NASA maintains ownership of the app’s source code and contributes actively to refine AI models alongside Google’s technology and third-party integrations.NASA’s AI medical assistant achieves high accuracy in testing key medical scenariosCMO-DA has already undergone preliminary testing using three simulated medical cases: ankle injury, flank pain, and ear pain. A panel comprising two physicians and one astronaut assessed the assistant’s performance across four key areas:Initial patient assessmentMedical history takingClinical reasoning and diagnosisTreatment planningThe results were encouraging, with diagnostic accuracies recorded as:88% for ankle injury74% for flank pain80% for ear painThese outcomes indicate strong potential for the assistant to provide reliable autonomous medical support during space missions.NASA’s plan to enhance CMO-DA for advanced space healthcareNASA plans an incremental development approach to continuously improve the CMO-DA system. Upcoming updates will focus on:Integrating medical device data: Incorporating inputs from onboard diagnostic tools for richer information.Enhancing situational awareness: Adapting AI algorithms to account for spaceflight-specific factors such as microgravity’s effects on human physiology.Contextualized medical advice: Delivering treatment recommendations tailored to the unique environment and conditions of deep space.This will enable the assistant to offer more precise, relevant, and timely healthcare guidance in the isolated and challenging environment of space.How NASA’s AI medical assistant could transform healthcare worldwideWhile designed for space, the implications of this AI-powered medical assistant extend far beyond astronaut health. David Cruley, a Google Public Sector engineer involved in the project, noted that although regulatory approval plans for terrestrial use are not yet confirmed, success in space missions could catalyze the adoption of similar AI tools on Earth.Possible benefits on Earth include:Improved medical care in remote and underserved areasEnhanced diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision supportIncreased accessibility to healthcare expertise in environments lacking specialistsNASA and Google also envision that lessons learned from CMO-DA’s development will accelerate innovation in the broader field of AI-driven medicine, ultimately improving patient care worldwide.Also Read | 4.56-billion-year-old McDonough meteorite older than Earth crashes into Georgia home; stuns scientistsAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Swift has cultivated a loyal fanbase through immersive experiences and reclaimed ownership of her music, disrupting industry norms. Her relentless work ethic and strategic decisions have propelled her into a powerful figure, offering a blueprint for success in any field.  Behind the glittering lights and chart-topping hits lies a carefully crafted strategy that has propelled Taylor Swift into one of the most powerful figures in the global entertainment industry. A NASA engineer has cracked the code behind Taylor Swift’s meteoric rise to global superstardom, revealing insights that extend far beyond her music. Sinéad O’Sullivan, a Harvard Business School graduate and seasoned rocket scientist, spent years analyzing Swift’s career and business strategies.In her upcoming book Good Ideas and Power Moves, O’Sullivan says that Swift’s success isn’t just about catchy songs or lucky breaks. Instead, it is the result of deliberate, strategic moves that anyone can learn from. From building a loyal fanbase to rewriting industry rules, Swift has crafted a personal brand and empire that generates billions and reshapes markets, offering a blueprint for success in any field.Taylor Swift’s strategic empire-building beyond musicO’Sullivan’s research highlights that Swift’s genius lies in her ability to construct entire worlds, not just songs. Taylor Swift has expertly crafted an expansive fan universe known as the “Swiftverse,” which goes far beyond her music to create an immersive, interactive experience for her fans, affectionately called Swifties. This world includes elaborate storytelling, hidden Easter eggs in lyrics, themed visuals, and multi-platform social media engagement that encourages fans to connect deeply, not only with her art but also with each other.This fosters a strong sense of community and loyalty, transforming fans into passionate supporters who actively drive her brand’s growth. The massive success of her Eras Tour exemplifies this phenomenon, injecting an estimated $5 billion into the US economy through ticket sales, travel, accommodations, merchandise, and job creation, especially boosting sectors like tourism and retail during a crucial post-pandemic recovery phase.Taylor Swift’s control over music rights and relentless work ethicA cornerstone of Swift’s empire is her strategic decision to reclaim ownership of her early work by re-recording her first six albums as “Taylor’s Version.” This move disrupted conventional music industry norms after her masters were sold without her consent, allowing her to regain financial control and send a powerful message about artist empowerment and creative agency.Beyond this, Swift’s meteoric rise is fueled by her relentless work ethic, unwavering self-belief, and deliberate choices. Balancing intensive touring, continuous music production, and broad business ventures, she demonstrates that meaningful success comes from taking risks, learning from failures, and staying true to one’s vision. Her journey offers a blueprint for aspiring entrepreneurs and artists on the importance of resilience, persistence, and owning one’s path to success.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Scientists are studying this biological marvel to inspire the creation of super-durable materials. This research could revolutionize industries by enabling the development of advanced cutting tools, biomedical implants, and self-repairing structures, mimicking nature's ingenious design. Source: The University of Chicago You’d expect the hardest teeth in nature to belong to sharks, crocodiles, or some ancient dino. But surprisingly the title goes to a slow-moving, algae-scraping mollusc called the chiton. This groundbreaking new study published in Science reveals that chitons, marine molluscs you’ve probably never heard of, grow teeth that aren’t just hard, they're harder than stainless steel, zirconium oxide, and even human enamel. And here’s the real kicker: they do it at room temperature, using a precise, protein-controlled biological system.Scientists say this process could inspire the next generation of supermaterials used in cutting tools, surgical implants, dental prosthetics, and protective coatings , all with nanoscale precision. Let’s dive into the science behind nature’s hardest, most magnetic teeth. Curious? Let’s break down what the study found and why it's got scientists (and engineers) geeking out.What are chitons and why do their teeth matter?Chitons are small, ancient marine molluscs that cling to rocks and feed by scraping algae off surfaces using a ribbon-like tongue called a radula. The teeth on this radula are constantly worn down and regrown and they happen to be the hardest known biological material on Earth, even stronger than enamel or bone.Scientists have long been fascinated by the strength of chiton teeth, but this new study reveals why they're so strong and how their structure could influence materials science.The science behind chiton teeth: Built to crushThe researchers used high-resolution electron microscopy and spectrometry to analyse the nanostructure of chiton teeth. What they found was extraordinary:The teeth contain magnetite, an iron-based mineral, arranged in a tightly packed, nanoscale crystalline structure.These crystals are embedded in a soft organic matrix, which offers both rigidity and flexibility, a rare combination in natural materials.This combination makes the teeth not just hard but incredibly wear-resistant, ideal for scraping rock surfaces without damage.Why this study could change future materialsThe implications of this research stretch far beyond marine biology. Materials inspired by chiton teeth could be used to:Build durable coatings for cutting tools, drills, and other high-friction equipmentCreate longer-lasting materials for aerospace or biomedical applicationsDevelop self-repairing synthetic structures that mimic how chitons regrow teethThe study's lead author, Dr. Erika Easterling, explained that nature often holds the blueprints for advanced engineering: "By studying organisms like chitons, we can reverse-engineer solutions for some of our toughest material challenges."Now that the microstructure of chiton teeth is better understood, researchers are working on synthetic replication using nanomaterials. The goal is to reproduce this biological architecture in labs and eventually at scale, creating next-gen materials that combine hardness, flexibility, and self-renewal.Nature's toughest teeth may soon inspire industrial revolutions, proving once again that biology often beats the lab in innovation.Also read| These 15 science facts are so bizarre, you'll think we're lying (but we're not)About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

This gas giant, larger than Saturn but less massive, orbits a star only one-fifth the Sun's mass. The discovery suggests that large planets might be more common around small stars than previously believed. Source: Earth.com  Astronomers have discovered a giant planet named TOI-6894b orbiting a very small red dwarf star that has only one-fifth the mass of the Sun. Despite the star’s small size and low brightness, TOI-6894b is larger than Saturn but has only half its mass. This surprising discovery challenges previous ideas that such tiny stars cannot form or hold large gas planets. According to a study published in Nature Astronomy and reported by Earth.com, large planets may be more common around small stars than scientists once believed, opening new possibilities for understanding how planets form.Huge planet discovered orbiting one of the smallest red dwarf stars: TOI-6894BTOI-6894b was found using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Its host star, TOI-6894, is a cool red dwarf, much smaller and dimmer than our Sun. Despite this, TOI-6894b has a radius larger than Saturn but with only half its mass. This makes the star the smallest known to have such a large gas giant orbiting it. This discovery challenges the assumption that small stars cannot form or hold giant planets. TOI-6894b’s low density suggests an extremely puffy atmosphere, possibly influenced by stellar radiation or internal heat, requiring further observational studies.Challenging planet formation theories: How TOI-6894b formed around a tiny starTraditional planet formation theories, such as core accretion, suggest that low-mass stars have thin discs of gas and dust that are not enough to build large planets. Scientists believe TOI-6894b could have formed through a modified core accretion process or through gravitational instability, where parts of the disc collapse quickly under their own gravity. Neither explanation perfectly fits current data, highlighting the need for further research to understand how such a massive planet can form around a tiny star.James Webb Telescope to study TOI-6894b’s rare methane and ammonia atmosphereTOI-6894b orbits far enough from its star to have a relatively cool atmosphere, with an estimated temperature of 420 Kelvin (about 147 degrees Celsius). Its atmosphere is expected to be rich in methane, which is rare among exoplanets, and may contain ammonia as well. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will observe this planet soon, providing valuable data to better understand its atmosphere and formation. This could offer important clues about planet formation in environments very different from our own solar system.Implications for astronomy and the Milky WayThis discovery has big implications for astronomy. Since most stars in the Milky Way are small red dwarfs, finding a giant planet around one suggests that such planets may be more common than previously thought. The study involved researchers from the University of Warwick, University College London, and the University of Birmingham. TOI-6894b challenges existing models and will help scientists improve their understanding of planet formation and the diversity of planetary systems in our galaxy.Also read | Seven superclouds: Giant gas neighbors of our solar system discovered About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

This visual evidence provides an unprecedented opportunity to study seismic ruptures in real-time. The analysis of this footage could refine earthquake prediction models and enhance early-warning systems, potentially saving lives in the future. Representative AI Image For the first time in history, scientists have captured clear footage of the Earth’s surface physically splitting during a powerful earthquake. The dramatic event, recorded by high-speed cameras and ground sensors in a remote seismic hotspot, shows the crust tearing apart along a fault line in real time. This unprecedented visual evidence offers scientists an extraordinary opportunity to study the mechanics of seismic ruptures, potentially improving early-warning systems and our understanding of how earthquakes propagate. Experts are calling it a milestone moment in the field of geophysics.How the Earth split was capturedThe footage was obtained during a recent earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale. Researchers had positioned advanced recording equipment in the region after detecting increased seismic activity over the past few months. When the quake struck, cameras captured the ground shifting violently, creating a visible crack stretching hundreds of meters. Normally, such events occur too quickly and unpredictably to record in detail, making this a rare scientific achievement. Researchers hope this footage will also inspire the development of new, real-time monitoring technologies for earthquake-prone regions.Pulse-like rupture and curved slip - Analysis of Myanmar earthquake ruptureWhy this matters for earthquake scienceSeismologists explain that seeing the rupture unfold on camera allows them to analyze fault movement frame by frame. This can reveal the speed of the split, the energy released, and how the rupture propagated along the fault. The findings could refine earthquake prediction models and help urban planners design more resilient infrastructure in quake-prone areas. The footage may also provide crucial insights into how secondary faults activate during major earthquakes, improving our understanding of cascading seismic hazards.With precise rupture dynamics now observable, scientists believe they can enhance algorithms used in earthquake early-warning networks. By recognizing specific seismic signatures just before a rupture occurs, these systems might provide precious seconds or even minutes of warning, potentially saving lives. Additionally, researchers aim to integrate this real-world data into machine learning models to improve the accuracy of earthquake simulations. This innovative approach could revolutionize how scientists predict seismic impacts and inform emergency response strategies. Continued advancements in imaging technology and data analysis are crucial for unlocking deeper insights into earthquake behavior. Such groundbreaking observations could mark the beginning of a new era in seismology.Next steps in the researchThe video will undergo detailed analysis by an international team of geologists and engineers. They plan to compare the footage with seismic data from the same event to build a more complete understanding of the quake. This collaborative effort will also involve sharing findings with global earthquake monitoring agencies to enhance worldwide preparedness. The team hopes that these insights will lead to improved building codes and disaster management protocols in vulnerable regions. In addition, the team intends to simulate the rupture in advanced earthquake laboratories to test how different soil types and fault conditions affect ground movement. Furthermore, they aim to develop predictive models that can be customized for different geographic regions, enhancing local risk assessments. This could help forecast how future quakes might impact specific regions. Results from this research could be published within the next year, offering new insights into one of Earth’s most powerful natural processes.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

While Yuri orbited Earth on the ISS, Ekaterina waited in Houston, bridging the distance through a live video link. This extraordinary event showcased love's ability to transcend boundaries, blending space exploration with personal connection and capturing global attention. Source: Russia Beyond On August 10, 2003, the International Space Station became the setting for one of the most extraordinary weddings ever recorded. Orbiting Earth at 28,000 km/h, Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko said “I do” to his American fiancée Ekaterina Dmitriev, who stood waiting 400 km below at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.This was no publicity stunt—it was a daring blend of love and spaceflight, navigating complex legal, technical, and cultural hurdles. In a moment that bridged two worlds—the boundless expanse of space and the intimacy of human connection—it proved that even in the most advanced realms of exploration, the heart still finds its own orbit.International Space Station becomes the world’s most unusual wedding venueThe ISS is a multi-national laboratory in low Earth orbit, a place where every minute is carefully scheduled for experiments, maintenance, and communications. Weddings were not part of its official mission objectives.Yet, on that August day, the station’s communication systems—designed for critical mission updates, data transfer, and crew coordination—were temporarily adapted to facilitate a marriage ceremony. At the time, the ISS was orbiting roughly 400 km above Earth, completing one orbit every 90 minutes. That meant that during the wedding, the station likely passed over multiple continents, giving “worldwide coverage” a very literal meaning.How Russian cosmonaut long-distance romance led to the first wedding in spaceYuri Malenchenko, already a veteran of multiple spaceflights, had spent much of his professional life training and working away from home. Ekaterina Dmitriev, a US-based space enthusiast of Russian descent, had met him years earlier through mutual acquaintances in the aerospace field.Their relationship was a lesson in long-distance endurance. Malenchenko often trained in Star City, Russia, while Dmitriev lived in the United States. They sustained their romance through phone calls, occasional visits, and a shared passion for space exploration. The couple initially planned a traditional wedding with 200 guests in attendance. But when Malenchenko’s mission aboard the ISS was unexpectedly extended, postponing the wedding by months or even years, they faced a choice—delay the marriage or find a way to bridge the gap.They chose the latter. After securing approval from Russian space authorities, they planned what became the first and only marriage ceremony conducted from space.Inside the International Space Station’s first-ever wedding ceremonyConducting a wedding between space and Earth involved complex coordination between Roscosmos (Russian space agency) and NASA. The ISS’s Ku-band communication system was used to transmit live video and audio between the spacecraft and mission control.Key elements of the ceremony:Visual connection: Dmitriev stood in a decorated room at NASA’s Houston facility, while Malenchenko appeared live on a monitor from the ISS.Dress code: Malenchenko wore his formal Russian space suit with a bow tie as a symbolic gesture. Dmitriev wore a traditional ivory wedding gown.Music in orbit: Astronaut Ed Lu, serving as Malenchenko’s best man, played the wedding march on a small keyboard aboard the ISS.Cultural touches: Dmitriev walked down the aisle to David Bowie’s “Space Oddity”, linking the ceremony to space pop culture.Symbolic gestures: The bride blew a kiss toward the camera, and the groom reciprocated from orbit.From orbit to Earth: The reunion after the first wedding in spaceEkaterina Dmitriev later told the New York Times that, “As Yuri was further away, he was closer to me because of the communication we have.” She called the orbital wedding a reflection of “mankind’s desire and need to go one step further.”Marriage became a symbol of human adaptability—proving that even in the most extreme environments, people find ways to preserve traditions and emotional bonds. It also captured the imagination of the public, blending romance, technology, and exploration in a single event. Following the ceremony, Malenchenko continued his ISS duties for several months. In October 2003, he returned to Earth, finally meeting his wife in person as her husband. Photographs of their reunion marked the end of one of the most remarkable long-distance weddings in history.Also Read | 4.56-billion-year-old McDonough meteorite older than Earth crashes into Georgia home; stuns scientistsAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

The discovery, enabled by advanced mapping, reveals a galactic framework influencing star formation and galactic evolution, opening new avenues for astronomical research. Source: ScienceNews In a stunning breakthrough, astronomers have discovered seven massive structures of gas known as superclouds just beyond our solar system. These immense clouds, stretching thousands of light-years across, are likely the birthplaces of stars and may have formed from material stripped from the spiral arms of the Milky Way. While two of them, including the well-known Radcliffe Wave, had been identified earlier, five are brand new discoveries. Lying nearly parallel to each other and undulating in wave-like patterns, these superclouds are our largest local neighbours in space and are rewriting what we know about interstellar structure and star formation.A hidden interstellar structure revealed by modern mappingThanks to advanced space mapping using data from the Gaia spacecraft, a team of astronomers led by Lilly Kormann from the University of Vienna has charted a detailed 3D map of interstellar dust and hydrogen within 50 million square light-years around the Sun. What they initially saw were patches of high-density dust, but a closer analysis revealed that many of these dense zones were linked together in long, coherent structures. By connecting the dots, the team identified seven vast superclouds, including the Radcliffe Wave and a previously known one called the Split, lying close to the solar system in an almost parallel arrangement.Colossal dimensions and massEach of the seven superclouds stretches between 3,000 and 8,000 light-years in length and holds gas weighing 800,000 to 3.5 million times the mass of the Sun. These massive forms are not only among the largest known local structures in our galaxy, but researchers believe they might be even larger than measured, as parts likely extend beyond the edges of the current dust map. Positioned along the Milky Way’s disc, these superclouds form a sort of galactic framework that may shape the way stars and star systems, including ours, are created and distributed across space.Star nurseries within the supercloudsWhat makes this discovery especially important is that most known stellar nurseries, regions where new stars are born, are located inside these superclouds, particularly along their central spines. This pattern strongly suggests that superclouds play a foundational role in star formation, acting as the “mothers” to smaller, denser gas clouds that collapse under gravity to form stars. Scientists now believe these superclouds represent an early stage in the hierarchy of star-making, offering insight into how vast structures break down into smaller ones, eventually producing stars, solar systems, and perhaps even planets like Earth.The mystery of the wavesMost of the superclouds show a distinct wave-like form, rising and falling in an undulating pattern above and below the flat disc of the Milky Way. Only one, the Split, remains relatively straight. The fact that so many of these gas clouds zigzag in unison suggests there’s a common physical mechanism shaping them, possibly linked to galactic gravity, spiral arm dynamics, or even external galactic forces. Even more intriguing is how their average densities remain strikingly similar, despite differences in the amount of material packed into each section. This hints at a larger, still-unknown system regulating their structure and behaviour.What this means for astronomyThis discovery marks a turning point in our understanding of the local interstellar medium, the cloud-like environment that surrounds our solar system. As astrophysicist Bruce Elmegreen put it, we are only now beginning to "see what is very local to us," after decades of struggling to separate nearby structures from distant background noise. The identification of these seven superclouds gives scientists a valuable new framework to study star formation, interstellar physics, and the evolution of our galaxy on a large scale. It also opens new questions about what other structures might still be hidden in the cosmic dust.Also read | New Hubble photo shows cotton candy-like nebula in a nearby dwarf galaxyAbout the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Originating from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, the rock formed 4.56 billion years ago. Scientists emphasize that studying such meteorites is crucial for planetary defense, potentially helping to prevent catastrophic impacts in the future.  A meteorite fragment that tore through the roof of a Georgia home last June has been found to be older than Earth itself, according to scientists at the University of Georgia.Geologist Scott Harris told Fox News Digital that the rock, which fell on June 26 near Atlanta, originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Analysis shows it formed 4.56 billion years ago — slightly before the birth of the Earth, estimated at 4.54 billion years.A fiery descentEyewitnesses reported seeing a bright fireball streak across the sky that day. Harris was quickly called to investigate the home, where he traced the meteorite's dramatic path: A clean hole through the roof and an air ductPenetration through insulation and the ceiling Impact with the floor, leaving a crater the size of a large cherry tomatoPollHave you ever witnessed a meteor shower or meteorite fall?Yes, I haveNo, neverThe fragment hit with such force that part of it was pulverised "like somebody hitting it with a sledgehammer," Harris said. The rock briefly broke the sound barrier before impact.No danger this time — but a reminder for the futureWhile the small size of the meteorite posed no threat to the homeowners, Harris said studying such falls is crucial for planetary defence. Understanding how meteorites travel through space and into Earth's atmosphere could help scientists predict — and prevent — catastrophic impacts.He pointed to Nasa's DART mission as an example of potential defence, where a spacecraft successfully altered the path of an asteroid through kinetic impact."If you move an asteroid early enough, you can get it to avoid us altogether," Harris said.

This image provided by NASA shows, from left, NASA's SpaceX Crew-10 members JAXA  Four astronauts have safely returned to Earth after spending five months aboard the International space station (ISS). Their SpaceX capsule splashed down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California on Saturday, a day after leaving the orbiting laboratory.Nasa’s Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan’s Takuya Onishi, and Russia’s Kirill Peskov launched in March to replace the two Nasa astronauts stranded on Boeing’s Starliner following its failed test mission. “Welcome home,” Mission Control at SpaceX radioed as the capsule parachuted into the water.Starliner’s malfunctions forced Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to remain in orbit for more than nine months instead of a planned week. Nasa eventually ordered the capsule to return empty, transferring the pair to a SpaceX flight. Wilmore has since retired from Nasa.Before departure on Friday, McClain said, “We want this mission, our mission, to be a reminder of what people can do when we work together, when we explore together.” She said she was looking forward to “doing nothing for a couple of days” in Houston, while her crewmates hoped for hot showers and burgers.This was SpaceX’s first Nasa crew splashdown in the Pacific in 50 years, with Elon Musk’s company shifting returns from Florida to California earlier this year to reduce debris risks. The last Nasa astronauts to land in the Pacific were part of the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz mission, a historic joint effort between the US and the Soviet Union.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

Amidst growing international competition, this project aims to secure U.S. leadership in space and enable future Mars missions.  NASA has unveiled plans to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2030 as part of its Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the lunar surface and establish a sustainable presence. This ambitious move comes amid increasing international competition in space exploration, with countries like China and Russia developing similar nuclear-powered lunar projects. The reactor is designed to provide a continuous, reliable source of energy to power habitats, scientific instruments, rovers, and mining operations, especially during the Moon’s lengthy nights and permanently shadowed craters where solar power is ineffective.The development of this nuclear power system marks a crucial step toward creating the infrastructure necessary for long-term lunar habitation and resource utilization. Unlike previous missions that relied heavily on solar panels and limited battery storage, a nuclear reactor could enable round-the-clock operations and pave the way for deeper space exploration, including future missions to Mars.Why NASA wants to build a nuclear reactor on the MoonNASA has been quietly developing small nuclear power systems in collaboration with the Department of Energy for years. The plan is to deploy a small modular nuclear reactor capable of producing at least 100 kilowatts of electricity, enough to power about 80 homes on Earth. This reactor will provide continuous energy without interruption, a critical advantage over solar power, which falters during the Moon’s two-week-long nights.The Moon’s south pole is a particular focus due to its abundant water ice deposits, essential for life support and fuel production. However, these craters are permanently shadowed, receiving little to no sunlight, rendering solar energy impractical. The nuclear reactor will enable operations in these challenging environments, supporting scientific research, mining activities, and habitat life-support systems.NASA’s Acting Administrator Sean Duffy has emphasized the importance of this technology for Artemis’ goals, calling it a “game changer” for sustained lunar presence. The project is also seen as a testbed for technologies that could eventually support human missions to Mars, where solar energy is even less reliable.Geopolitical stakes and the race for lunar infrastructureThe push for a nuclear reactor on the Moon comes at a time of heightened geopolitical competition in space. China announced plans in 2025 to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2035, while Russia has also expressed ambitions in this domain. Establishing nuclear infrastructure is more than a technical achievement; it signals a country’s ability to exert influence and control over critical lunar regions.Under the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, no nation can claim sovereignty over the Moon or other celestial bodies. However, building infrastructure such as nuclear reactors and bases effectively sets “keep-out zones” around these installations. These zones grant operators significant control over access to nearby resources, like the valuable ice deposits at the lunar south pole, which could be used to produce rocket fuel and sustain life.Experts view NASA’s project as a strategic move to maintain U.S. leadership in space exploration and to shape international norms for the responsible and peaceful use of nuclear power beyond Earth. Transparency, adherence to international guidelines, and cooperation will be essential to prevent conflict and ensure that space remains a domain for peaceful exploration.Why nuclear power is essential for the future of space explorationSolar panels have powered numerous space missions successfully, but their limitations are becoming increasingly apparent as humans prepare for long-term habitation beyond Earth. The Moon’s long nights and shadowed craters present significant challenges for solar energy, while Mars’ greater distance from the Sun further reduces its effectiveness.A nuclear reactor on the Moon can provide a stable, high-density power source capable of supporting demanding applications such as 3D printing of habitats, life support systems, communication networks, and scientific experiments. It also reduces reliance on expensive and logistically complex resupply missions from Earth.While concerns about safety and radiation risks exist, NASA and international space agencies adhere to strict safety protocols. The use of radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) in past missions, such as the Voyager probes and Mars rovers, has demonstrated the feasibility and safety of nuclear power in space. The planned lunar reactor would be designed with containment and fail-safe measures to minimize risks.About the AuthorTOI Science DeskThe TOI Science Desk stands as an inquisitive team of journalists, ceaselessly delving into the realms of discovery to curate a captivating collection of news, features, and articles from the vast and ever-evolving world of science for the readers of The Times of India.

KAOHSIUNG: Thousands of people sheltered and fishermen secured their boats across storm-battered southern Taiwan on Wednesday as Typhoon Podul intensified on its approach to the island.The typhoon is packing wind speeds of 155 kilometres (96 miles) per hour at its centre and "is strengthening", Central Weather Administration (CWA) forecaster Lin Ting-yi told AFP.Podul is on track to hit lightly populated Taitung County at around noon (0400 GMT) before sweeping across the island and into the Taiwan Strait."We are worried about this typhoon," Kaohsiung fisherman Huang Wei told AFP as he used more ropes to tie down his boat and checked on other vessels."We had already made general typhoon preparations yesterday, but this morning I woke up and saw news reports that the typhoon has intensified to be as strong as the last, (Typhoon) Krathon," Huang said."Last time, the two boats behind us weren't tied properly and hit my boat."Krathon slammed into Kaohsiung in October, with wind gusts of 162kph. Podul has gusts of 191kph, Lin said. More than 5,500 people have been evacuated from their homes ahead of Podul, disaster officials said Wednesday, as the typhoon threatens to pound central and southern regions that are still recovering from storms last month.Mountainous areas of Kaohsiung City and neighbouring Pingtung County, as well as Hualien and Taitung counties, could see torrential rain, the CWA said.All domestic flights across the island of 23 million people have been cancelled, along with dozens of international journeys.Many ferry services have been suspended and businesses and schools across the south closed.Typhoon Danas, which hit Taiwan in early July, killed two people and injured hundreds as the storm dumped more than 500mm (about 20 inches) of rain across the south over a weekend.That was followed by torrential rain from July 28 to August 4, with some areas recording more than Taiwan's rainfall of 2.1 metres for 2024.The week of bad weather left five people dead, three missing, and 78 injured, a disaster official said previously.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 expensive animal-shaped bags that’ll leave you almost shocked!Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?Maharashtra’s UNESCO World Heritage Sites and other iconic monuments for history loversRajinikanth completes 50 years in cinema: Lesser-known facts about the ‘Coolie’ star6 lizards that prove reptiles can be adorable123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

The talks are mandated to look at the full life cycle of plastic, from production to pollution, but some countries are unhappy with such a wide scope. Representative image GENEVA: Talks on forging a landmark treaty to combat the scourge of plastic pollution were stumbling Saturday, with progress slow and countries wildly at odds on how far the proposed agreement should go.The negotiations, which opened on Tuesday, have four working days left to strike a legally-binding instrument that would tackle the growing problem choking the environment.In a blunt mid-way assessment, talks chair Luis Vayas Valdivieso warned the 184 countries negotiating at the United Nations that they had to get shifting to get a deal."Progress made has not been sufficient," Vayas told delegates."A real push to achieve our common goal is needed," the Ecuadoran diplomat said, adding that Thursday was not a just deadline but "a date by which we must deliver."Some articles still have unresolved issues and show little progress towards reaching a common understanding," Vayas lamented.The key fracture is between countries that want to focus on waste management and others who want a more ambitious treaty that also cuts production and eliminates use of the most toxic chemicals.And with the talks relying on finding consensus, it has become a game of brinkmanship.A diplomatic source told reporters that many informal meetings had been scrambled together for Sunday's day off to try and break the deadlock."If nothing changes, we won't get there," the source added.Battle of the bracketsCountries have reconvened in Geneva after the failure of the supposedly fifth and final round of negotiations in Busan, South Korea in 2024.After four days of talks, the draft text has ballooned from 22 to 35 pages -- with the number of brackets in the text going up near five-fold to almost 1,500 as countries insert a blizzard of conflicting wishes and ideas.The talks are mandated to look at the full life cycle of plastic, from production to pollution, but some countries are unhappy with such a wide scope.Kuwait spoke up for the so-called Like-Minded Group -- a nebulous cluster of mostly oil-producing nations which rejects production limits and wants to focus on treating waste."Let us agree on what we can agree. Consensus must be the basis of all our decisions," Kuwait insisted.Nudging in the same direction, Saudi Arabia, speaking for the Arab Group, said the responsible way ahead was to start considering what bits of the text "may not make it to the final outcome due to irreconcilable divergence".But given how little is truly agreed on, Uruguay warned that consensus "cannot be used as a justification to not achieve our objectives".Eirik Lindebjerg, global plastics adviser for the World Wide Fund for Nature, told AFP that the Like-Minded Group's proposal was "another attempt to make it a waste management agreement", and to stifle talks on reducing the amount of plastic in circulation.Path through the fogThe UN Environment Programme is hosting the talks and swiftly called a press conference after the stock-take session.UNEP executive director Inger Andersen said a deal was "really within our grasp, even though today it might not look so"."Despite the fog of negotiations I'm really encouraged," she told reporters, insisting: "There is a pathway to success."Vayas added: "We need to accelerate. We need a better rhythm in this and we need to also work in such a way that it will be clear that we will deliver by the end."Afterwards, Bjorn Beeler, executive director at IPEN, a global network aimed at limiting toxic chemicals, told AFP: "This whole process has not been able to take decisions and is still collecting ideas. We're sleepwalking towards a cliff and if we don't wake up, we're falling off."'Profits from poisoning'Plastic pollution is so ubiquitous that microplastics have been found on the highest mountain peaks, in the deepest ocean trench and scattered throughout almost every part of the human body.More than 400 million tonnes of plastic are produced globally each year, half of which is for single-use items.Plastic production is set to triple by 2060.Panama's negotiator Juan Monterrey Gomez took the floor to slam those countries wanting to stop the treaty from encompassing the entire life cycle of plastic.He said microplastics "are in our blood, in our lungs and in the first cry of a new-born child. Our bodies are living proof of a system that profits from poisoning us".

Climate heat extremes driving tropical bird decline: study
Tropical bird populations have plummeted not only due to deforestation but also extreme heat attributable to climate change, according to a study published on Monday in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.  Another study published in 2017 showed how some tropical hummingbirds are now forced to seek shade to regulate their temperature in extreme heat, cutting into the amount of time they can spend searching for life-sustaining nectar.

Another study published in 2017 showed how some tropical hummingbirds are now forced to seek shade to regulate their temperature in extreme heat, cutting into the amount of time they can spend searching for life-sustaining nectar.  Representative image PARIS: Tropical bird populations have plummeted not only due to deforestation but also extreme heat attributable to climate change, according to a study published on Monday in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. Intensifying temepratures caused a 25-38 percent reduction in tropical bird populations between 1950 and 2020, compared to a scenario without manmade global warming, scientists based in Europe and Australia reported. "The findings are pretty stark," lead author Maximilian Kotz, a researcher at the National Supercomputing Centre in Barcelona and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), told AFP.Bird populations in the tropics now face 30 days of heat extremes per year compared to three per year in the mid-20th century, he noted. "This has major consequences for how we think about biodiversity conservation," Kotz said by email. "Protecting pristine habitats is crucial, but without dealing with climate change it won't be enough for birds."Nearly half of all bird species are found in biodiversity-rich tropical regions. These often colourful animals perform essential services for ecosystems, such as dispersing plant seeds. Invasive species another threatBut birds living in these regions may already be "close to the limits" of their tolerance to high temperatures, which can cause heatstroke (hyperthermia) or dehydration. The overview study does not provide figures for individual species, but earlier literature is rich with examples of the devastating impact of rising temperatures.One documented the heat-related decline of birds in Panama, including the king quetzal, the red-crested quetzal, the two-coloured kingfisher and the aurora trogon. Another study published in 2017 showed how some tropical hummingbirds are now forced to seek shade to regulate their temperature in extreme heat, cutting into the amount of time they can spend searching for life-sustaining nectar. Extreme heat waves, which are becoming more frequent, represent a far greater threat than increases in average temperatures or rainfall, another result of human-induced climate change. Up to now, it has been assumed that the decline in bird populations worldwide was due mainly to other well-identified factors, especially habitat loss, pesticide use, hunting, and invasive species, especially snakes that snack on bird eggs and mosquitos carrying avian malaria. But the new findings "challenge the view that direct human pressures have so far been the dominant driver of impacts on bird populations compared to climate change in tropical regions," according to the authors. To reach this conclusion, they analysed observational data from more than 3,000 bird populations around the world and used statistical modelling to isolate the effects of extreme weather from other factors.The findings help complete the picture of tropical bird decline, noted Aimee Van Tatenhove, a post-doctoral fellow at Cornell University's Center for Avian Population Studies who was not involved in the study."Deforestation has an obvious impact -- trees are cut and habitat is destroyed," she told AFP. "We need long-term datasets like the authors used to understand how extreme temperatures impact avian populations.""This study is an important reminder that we need to continue examining different causes of population declines and apply those findings to conservation initiatives," she continued.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  From Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leavesTop 5 Getaways in North and South India to Work RemotelyFrom Cristiano Ronaldo’s million-dollar sparkler to Arjun Tendulkar’s intimate proposal: Celebrity engagements that created buzz in 2025Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 expensive animal-shaped bags that’ll leave you almost shocked!Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

Silopi, a city in the Sirnak province, is located around 10 kilometres from the Iraq and Syrian borders. It shattered the previous national high of 49.5 C recorded in August 2023 in the western province of Eskisehir. Turkey has faced weeks of scorching heat along with several wildfires. Fourteen people lost their lives battling blazes last month in the western part of the country. Hundreds of people were evacuated on Friday in the northwest province of Canakkale, where the busy Dardanelles Strait was closed to maritime traffic due to two raging fires. The heatwave has also prompted fears of water shortages in some areas.

Representative image (Image: AP) LAGRASSE: A wildfire in southern France slowed overnight into Wednesday after injuring nine people and burning through 11,000 hectares of vegetation, local officials said. The blaze, which started on Tuesday afternoon, is still threatening several villages in the aude department, where 1,500 firefighters have been battling to extinguish it."The fire is advancing in an area where all the conditions are ripe for it to progress. We are monitoring the edges and the back of the fire to prevent flare-ups," said Lucie Roesch, secretary general of the qude prefecture.She said firefighters are expecting to receive aerial support at dawn, but warned "this fire will keep us busy for several days. It's a long-term operation".The fire's advance slowed overnight due to high humidity levels, she added.One person was seriously burned and another injured, the prefecture said, adding that seven firefighters were also hurt. Camping grounds and one village were partially evacuated, and several local roads have been closed."All of the Nation's resources are mobilised," French president Emmanuel Macron said on X, while calling on people to exercise "the utmost caution".The qude department has seen an increase in areas burnt in recent years, aggravated by low rainfall and the removal of vineyards, which used to help break the progression of fires.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous10 beautiful and low-maintenance fishes for home aquariumsLifestyleKelley Mack: A look into the actress's most popular worksEntertainmentMalvi Malhotra redefines chic in THESE picsEntertainmentVitamins in broccoli: A, C, K, and more in one powerful veggieLifestyleJenna Ortega’s Wednesday promo looks redefine gothic glamourEntertainmentMegha Chakraborty’s Bubbly Fashion GametvKajal Raghwani blends tradition with charm in every graceful ethnic momentEntertainmentReduce dementia risk: 10 lifestyle changes that can protect your brainLifestyleUnmissable entry looks of Bigg Boss Malayalam 7 contestantstvPeshwai nath to Nathuli: Trendy hoop naths that deserve a place in your vanity boxLifestyle Next123 Photostories  The secret of Lingaraj: A temple where two gods dwell as oneBeyond Gangtok: 5 hill stations in Sikkim that redefine peace and serenity5 Foods that can work like natural laxatives and fix constipationUntold stories from Jaya Prada’s life and legacy7 smart ways for couples to split financesExploring wild side of Goa: 5 wildlife sanctuaries that are a treat to the senses6 Surprising Animals That Don’t Have Bones in Their BodiesThe best exercises to get rid of cellulite5 saree colours Rekha wears on repeat!What happens when you eat 2 apples a day and 5 simple breakfast recipes to try123Hot PicksRBI MPC MeetPatna Double Decker BridgeSpiceJetRBI MPC MeetRussia OilUS China TradeNSDL IPO allotmentTop TrendingTrinity RodmanDe'Aaron FoxConnor BedardDennis RodmanRussell WilsonMitch MarnersKirby DachMatthew TkachukConnor McDavidAdam RuzickaTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteBird slams into plane nose: Cabin filled with smoke mid-air; panic on Paris-bound flight — watchBaby bonus: China offers subsidy to boost birth rate; why 'lie flat' gen isn't convinced‘Remains hopeful’: Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs’ lawyer seeks Trump’s pardon; Combs to remain jailed till sentencing'I am going to exert my powers': Prosecute minors as adults?

AI image ALGIERS: At a beach near Algiers, brown algae native to the Pacific Ocean cover the golden sand, posing a threat to ecosystems native to the area and their stench repelling swimmers at the peak of summer.Following a recent government call to help clear beaches swarmed by the seaweed species known scientifically as Rugulopteryx okamurae, several volunteers and charities have stepped in."When it washes up, we can't swim," said Salim Hemmedi, a 43-year-old vacationer at a beach in Sidi Fredj, where volunteers raked up heaps of the plant."We hope the situation will improve so that we can enjoy ourselves... and that children can swim in peace."The alga originates from temperate waters around Japan and the Korean peninsula in the northwest Pacific Ocean.It was first spotted in Algeria in late 2023, according to Lamia Bahbah, a lecturer and researcher at the National School of Marine Sciences and Coastal Planning.And lately, some have noted that it has been increasingly washed ashore.Youcef Segni, a marine engineer and biologist, said the algae proliferated at a significantly higher rate than in 2023 and 2024."They invade the habitats of other algae in the seabed, which leads to the disappearance of some species," he said, adding that it can also displace some native fish.Fast reproductionIn France, Spain and Portugal, the Rugulopteryx okamurae species has also been observed.Earlier this year, Spanish football club Real Betis introduced kits repurposed from seaweed to raise awareness about the issue.A 2023 study by the Marine Drugs journal said the alga's invasive character led to "a replacement of the native biota and an occupancy rate that reached almost 100 per cent in some locations" in Portugal.In Algeria, the plant has been spotted in at least three of the country's 14 coastal provinces, including the capital where 16 beaches are affected, authorities said."Are the waters suitable for swimming? Yes," said Environment Minister Nadjiba Djilali during the cleanup campaign, adding there were no records of the plant causing allergies.Researcher Bahbah said stopping its proliferation was "unfortunately impossible at this stage".She said the plant reproduces at a high rate, both sexually and asexually.The species can reproduce through fragmentation, meaning new individual algae can develop from fragmented pieces of other Rugulopteryx okamurae algae.The algae spread mainly by clinging to the hulls of boats, and the Mediterranean's moderate temperature favours the seaweed's fast reproduction."We are going to fight it," said Fella Zaboudj, a state engineer in marine sciences, adding that researchers were monitoring its spread, development and evolution.Zaboudj said research was also underway to determine whether the algae could be repurposed as fertiliser.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksSibu SorenPatna Double Decker BridgeSpiceJetRBI MPC MeetRussia OilUS China TradeNSDL IPO allotmentTop TrendingTrinity RodmanDe'Aaron FoxConnor BedardDennis RodmanRussell WilsonMitch MarnersKirby DachMatthew TkachukConnor McDavidAdam RuzickaTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website'Will raise tariff substantially in 24 hours': Donald Trump fires fresh salvo;

Ireland's wind energy sector has long been touted as full of potential. AI image BANGOR: On Ireland's blustery western seaboard, researchers are gleefully flying giant kites, not for fun but in the hope of generating renewable electricity and sparking a "revolution" in wind energy."We use a kite to capture the wind and a generator at the bottom of it that captures the power," Padraic Doherty of Kitepower, the Dutch firm behind the venture, told AFP. At its test site in operation since September 2023 near the small town of Bangor Erris, the team transports the vast 60-square-metre (645,000-square-feet) kite from a hangar across the lunar-like bogland to a generator. The kite is then attached by a cable tether to the machine and acts like a "yo-yo or fishing reel", Doherty said."It gets cast out and flies up, the tether pulls it back in, over and over again, creating energy," he said, testing the kite's ropes and pulleys before a flight.The sparsely populated spot near the stormy Atlantic coast is the world's first designated airborne renewable energy test site. And although the idea is still small in scale, it could yet prove to be a mighty plan as Ireland seeks to cut its reliance on fossil fuels such as oil and gas."We are witnessing a revolution in wind energy," said Andrei Luca, operations head at Kitepower, a zero-emissions energy solutions spin-off from the Delft University of Technology."It took nearly 25 years for wind turbines to evolve from 30-kilowatt prototypes to megawatt scale, and decades to offshore wind farms we see today," he added.The system flies autonomously, driven by software developed at the university in the Netherlands, but Doherty acts as the kite's "pilot" on the ground, monitoring its flight path for efficiency. The kite flies up around 400 metres (1,300 feet) and reels in to about 190 metres, generating around 30 kilowatts for storage.The force spins "like a dynamo on a bike", Doherty said, adding that "it generates up to two and a half tonnes of force through each turn".The electricity is stored in batteries, similar to solar photovoltaic systems, with the kite currently able to fully charge a 336-kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery."That's a meaningful amount of energy, sufficient for powering a remote outpost, a small island, polar station, or even a construction site," Luca said."Add additional kites and we can power a bigger island."'Mobile, flexible'According to Doherty, a chief advantage of the kite system is its flexibility and swift start-up capability."We can set up in 24 hours and can bring it anywhere, it's super mobile, and doesn't need expensive, time- and energy-consuming turbine foundations to be built," he said. A kite system is "way less invasive on the landscape (than wind turbines), produces clean energy and doesn't need a supply chain of fuel to keep running", Luca added.During January's Storm Eowyn, which caused widespread and long-lasting power outages in Ireland, the system showed its value in Bangor Erris, according to Luca. "Paired with a battery, it provided uninterrupted electricity before, during and after the storm," he said. Ireland's wind energy sector has long been touted as full of potential.But progress on large-scale delivery of onshore and offshore turbines has been held up by planning delays and electricity grid capacity constraints.The Irish government has set ambitious targets for offshore wind energy to deliver 20 gigawatts of energy by 2040 and at least 37 gigawatts by 2050.In 2024, Irish wind farms provided around a third of the country's electricity according to Wind Energy Ireland (WEI), a lobby group for the sector. This compares to the UK, where, according to trade association RenewableUK, wind energy from the country's combined wind farms first reached 20 gigawatts in November 2022.The ability of airborne wind energy (AWE) systems to harness high-altitude winds with relatively low infrastructure requirements "makes them particularly suitable for remote, offshore or mobile applications," Mahdi Salari, an AWE researcher at University College Cork, told AFP.But he said Kitepower would face challenges on "regulation, safety, and system reliability". Such technology however could plug gaps in places where "land availability, costs or logistical constraints hinder the deployment of traditional wind turbines", Salari said.By the 2030s, he said: "I expect AWE to contribute meaningfully to diversified, flexible and distributed renewable energy networks".Discover stories of India’s leading eco-innovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksSibu SorenPatna Double Decker BridgeSpiceJetGold Price PredectionRussia OilUS China TradeNSDL IPO allotmentTop TrendingRussell WilsonHailee SteinfeldsF1 StandingsDez BryantLebron James WifeRussia Oil ImportsTriple HPrince HarryRJ MahvashAntonio BrownTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteBrooke Hogan’s husband: Hulk Hogan showed no interest in meeting grandkidsDak Prescott builds new mansion, reveals why he razed the last oneTaylor Swift’s Kelce jacket inspires Kristin Juszczyk’s new NFL lineGabrielle Union on menopause: 'It makes it hard' — motherhood now more emotional, exhaustingGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai to employees: ‘I think we have to....'Apple CEO Tim Cook confirms: Majority of new iPhones sold in the US are 'made' in India;

'Nothing goes to waste': Denmark zoo asks people to donate their pets to feed its predators; assures animals will be 'gently euthanized'
Aalborg Zoo in Denmark is now accepting unwanted small pets as donations to feed its predators. The zoo assures that donated animals like rabbits and guinea pigs will be humanely euthanized before being used as food. This initiative aims to mimic the natural food chain, promoting animal welfare and natural behaviour among captive carnivores.

(Ai generated image)  If you have a pet you can no longer keep, one zoo in Denmark is offering an unusual option.Aalborg Zoo is asking the public to donate small pets — not for rehoming, but to be used as food for its captive predators.Aalborg Zoo, located in northern Denmark, said in a Facebook post that the move is meant to mimic the natural food chain of animals housed there. The zoo says this effort supports “animal welfare and professional integrity,” and assures that any donated pets will be “gently euthanized” by trained staff.“If you have a healthy animal that needs to be given away for various reasons, feel free to donate it to us,” the post said.The zoo lists rabbits, guinea pigs, horses and chickens as examples of suitable donations.PollWhat do you think about Aalborg Zoo's practice of accepting pets for food for predators?Support it for animal welfareOppose it, find other solutionsOnce euthanised, the animals will be used as fodder for the zoo’s carnivores.“That way, nothing goes to waste — and we ensure natural behaviour, nutrition and well-being of our predators,” the zoo claimed.The post is accompanied by a picture of a wildcat showing its teeth with its mouth wide open. It also includes a link to the zoo’s website.About the zoo Aalborg Zoo was founded in April 1935. The facility is located near the centre of Aalborg and spans 8 hectares. It houses more than 1,500 animals across 126 species and draws hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.According to the zoo’s official website, Aalborg Zoo focuses on conservation, sustainability and education.It takes part in international breeding programmes for endangered species and supports global efforts in animal conservation, research and fair trade.

Pedestrians were seen wading through flooded roads with extreme caution, fearing open manholes, uncovered drains, and the threat of electric shocks from submerged wires and poles.PollWhat do you think is the biggest issue causing urban flooding during monsoon?Poor drainage systemsLack of planning and maintenanceMeanwhile, the India Meteorological Department has predicted heavy rainfall in the region over the next few days.Moreover, contaminated water triggered a diarrhea outbreak in Bihar's Jehanabad.

House razings to save Niger capital's forest shield dismay locals
Hamissou Issiakou grumbled as he worked to strip bare his house, marked for demolition for illegally encroaching on the tip of green forest that's keeping the expanding desert at bay from Niger's capital. Director General of Water and Forests within the environment ministry Yacouba Seybou said on state television that since 2004 "decrees have prohibited housing in the (green) belt".

Director General of Water and Forests within the environment ministry Yacouba Seybou said on state television that since 2004 "decrees have prohibited housing in the (green) belt". Representative image (AFP) NIAMEY: Hamissou Issiakou grumbled as he worked to strip bare his house, marked for demolition for illegally encroaching on the tip of green forest that's keeping the expanding desert at bay from Niger's capital.His is one of nearly 500 homes being bulldozed as the authorities in the arid desert country, which is particularly at risk from man-made global warming, seek to shore up the wooded belt around Niamey's outskirts.Ukraine Launches MASSIVE Drone Attack On Russia; 3 Killed, Over 100 UAVs Shot Down"We've bought our plots of land at great expense. In the end it's a big waste," Issiakou told AFP, after urging workers to hurry up and remove an enormous gate before the police arrive. Since the heavy machinery began rolling in at the end of June, dozens of slums, luxury houses and apartment blocks have tumbled like a house of cards.Some homeowners have just stood by and watched in dismay as the bulldozers tore down their houses. Others, like Issiakou, have rushed to remove anything of value before the two-week notice period was up, from windows, metal sheets and electrical cables to small drinking water tanks and surveillance cameras.All say they bought their land from private real-estate agencies. - 'Submit to Allah' -In a country with one of the highest population growth rates in the world, the number of residents in Niamey has doubled since 2005, from 750,000 to one-and-a-half million, according to the national statistics institute. Thanks to that rapid urbanisation, the forest belt has lost more than half its area since it was completed in 1993 and now measures just 25 kilometres (16 miles) long and a kilometre wide. Hailing from various social classes, the woods' soon-to-be-gone inhabitants were originally attracted to the capital's outskirts by the good quality of life and reasonable cost of a plot. The distance from the bureaucracy within Niamey proper, which can often delay construction projects by years, did not hurt either. Thermos in hand, Aboul-Razak Moussa handed out coffee to the workmen using crowbars to dig up the cobblestones in the courtyard of his brand-new building."I bought the land for 12 million CFA francs ($21,000) and invested 127 million CFA francs (more than $220,000) to build my building," the owner of a welding company lamented."We submit ourselves to Allah." Businessman Ali Hamza was indignant."We're in the peak of the rainy season, it's inhuman," the father-of-10 argued. So far, at least 4,000 people have been evicted and nearly 500 homes, mostly slums, demolished, authorities say.- Rising temperatures -Carparks, petrol stations, pharmacies, shops, rubbish dumps and health centres sprung up to cater for those who made their home in the forested area.The project to introduce a green belt around Niamey is not part of the African Union's flagship Great Green Wall initiative, but its aims are the same.Landlocked Niger lies in the heart of the Sahel, a semiarid region stretching from Senegal to Sudan where temperatures are rising 1.5 times faster than the global average.At the same time, Niger suffers periods of drought and severe flooding.It is "imperative" that Niger "preserves more green spaces", Sani Ayouba, head of the Young Volunteers for the Environment NGO said.Director General of Water and Forests within the environment ministry Yacouba Seybou said on state television that since 2004 "decrees have prohibited housing in the (green) belt".Under the law, offenders face three months to two years in prison.Former ministers have "authorised private housing developments", Boubacar Maman, an official at the urban planning ministry, said.The environment ministry says a zoo and aquatic park as well as a botanic garden, sports and leisure area will soon be created within the forested green belt.bh/bam/bdi/sbk-kjm/yadEnd of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousTransform your boring sandals with trendy DIY embellishmentsLifestyleBhagyashri Borse's style statementsEntertainmentFrom Pulitzer to Orange: 10 prestigious awards given for LiteratureLifestyle10 veggies that can grow in containers in balconyLifestyle'Kingom' actor Vijay Deverakonda’s stylish looksEntertainmentVijay Deverakonda’s fitness workout routineEntertainmentTop 10 colour-changing birds of IndiaLifestyleRaksha Bandhan-worthy mehendi designs to try this yearLifestyle10 things to know before getting an Arowana fish for good luckLifestyleMouni Roy’s top 10 gorgeous ethnic lookstv Next123 Photostories  Top 6 zoos to visit across India for a complete wildlife experience10 minute daily habits that are perfect brain exercisesBigg Boss Malayalam 7 Contestant Aryan Kathuria: All about the handsome actor featured in a Poonam Pandey show6 healthy smart foods for babies when their teeth hurtFrom white themed rooms to aesthetic details: Debinna Bonnerjee’s living and bedroom give peaceful vibesHow to spend 5 days in Madhya Pradesh: The perfect Orchha–Khajuraho itineraryRisk of type 1 diabetes may depend on where childhood is spentBigg Boss Malayalam 7 contestant Abhisree: All about the actor-dancer with an inspiring journey5 filling foods under 50 calories7 key boundaries mentally strong people set to thrive at work123Hot PicksKamala HarrisIndian NavyJ&K landslideTrump TariffsUPI New RulesGST collectionsJulia HymanTop TrendingWWE Summerslam HighlightsHailee SteinfeldsTop Richest Billionaries in the worldEarthquake VideoLebron James WifeRJ MahvashGerman Influencer BengaluruKannada signboard ruleNayara EnergyIndia US Crude OilTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire Website'Disgraceful': Ex-South Korea president Yoon Suk Yeol resists questioning by laying down in underwear;

Turkish city calls for help after heat tops 50 degree celsius
Southeastern Turkey is reeling under a record-breaking heatwave, with temperatures exceeding 50C in Silopi. Residents are struggling with soaring electricity bills due to constant air conditioning use and are appealing for state support. Deforestation and policy changes allowing mining on agricultural lands exacerbate the heat, intensifying the challenges faced by locals who depend on air conditioning as a necessity.

Residents are struggling with soaring electricity bills due to constant air conditioning use and are appealing for state support. Deforestation and policy changes allowing mining on agricultural lands exacerbate the heat, intensifying the challenges faced by locals who depend on air conditioning as a necessity. Representative Image  A choking heatwave left astonished locals in southeastern Turkey calling for state help to pay their air conditioning bills after the temperature surged past 50 degree celsius."We cannot cope with the heat," ice-cream maker Recep Esiyok, 59, told AFP in Silopi, where meteorologists measured 50.5C on Friday -- a national record."I've been living in Silopi for about 30 years. I've never seen such heat... I've never seen such heat anywhere."He is getting through the heatwave thanks to the air conditioner in his shop, but is now worried about paying for the electricity."My bill last month was 59,000 lira (1,450 dollars). We are asking for state support on this issue."'Incomparable' heat: Before Friday's record, the previous peak in Turkey had been 49.5 degree celsius in August 2023.Scientists agree that climate change caused by humans burning fossil fuels is increasing the likelihood, length and intensity of heatwaves."The heat has reached a point where it's incomparable to previous years," said Halil Coskun, 52, a local reporter.The country is still in the grip of the heatwave and since Sunday temperatures overall have surged from six to 12 degrees above seasonal norms, according to the state meteorology directorate.Wildfire threat: Turkey has fought fires in several regions since the start of the summer. Last week, 10 people perished while fighting a fire in Eskisehir province.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday the country has experienced drier conditions than normal over the past five years as a result of global warming."Extreme heat, low humidity, and strong winds are unfortunately increasing the risk of fire," he said.He said the state was using drones to monitor and protect forests.The streets were relatively empty and the atmosphere tense in Silopi, a Kurdish city whose main income is trade with Iraq across the border 10 kilometres (six miles) away."When it's hot, there's no one outside during the day," said Esiyok.Deforestation complaints: Other locals complained at the lack of vegetation to provide relief around the town, which lies at the foot of a mountain."Unfortunately, the forests here were burned in the past for security reasons," said Coskun.He said the Turkish army cleared them in the search for fighters from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a rebel group that recently disarmed.Turkey's parliament this month also passed a bill that opens certain agricultural lands including olive groves to mining activities, despite widespread opposition."We could at least minimise the heat by planting trees, not by felling them," Coskun said.Electricity bills: Sweating in his kebab shop, another local, Cemil Seher, said that summers in Silopi last not three months, but five.For Seher, 51, air conditioning is no longer a luxury but a necessity."AC is essential here as much as bread and water," he said."When the air conditioners are running, the electricity bills are very high," he said, demanding authorities offer discounts for businesses."I want a discount not only for Silopi but for the entire region from here to Sanliurfa" in the east, he said."I am not making a profit because I've been working... to pay my electricity bill."Discover stories of India’s leading eco-innovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksKamala HarrisBogota AirportUS Oil ReserveTrump TariffsUPI New RulesStarlink SatelliteJulia HymanTop TrendingTravis KelceTom BradyBengaluru Boy Kidnap MurderCBSE Class 10th Sample PapersHow new nep rule worksYuzvendra Chahal DatingStephen CurryJoe BurrowBlake LivelyTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website40 jobs AI can't touch in 2025, says Microsoft Research: Is your career on the list?Former PM HD Devegowda's grandson Prajwal Revanna convicted for raping 47-year-old domestic helpIND vs ENG Live: Rain likely to play spoilsport as India eye 300; Woakes ruled outUPI new rules 2025: New NPCI changes kick in from August 1 - All you need to knowSSC exam 2025 glitches spark massive nationwide protest: Here’s why #SSCMisManagement is trending on social mediaCAT 2025 registration begins at iimcat.ac.in: Check direct link to apply online hereAP Police Constable final result 2025 released at slprb.ap.gov.in; check direct link hereIs Yuzvendra Chahal dating RJ Mahvash?

Chinese sub discovers deepest-ever creatures 10 km undersea
A Chinese submersible has discovered thousands of worms and molluscs nearly 10 kilometres (six miles) below sea level in the Mariana Trench, the deepest colony of creatures ever observed, a study revealed on Wednesday. Last year, the Chinese submersible "Fendouzhe" -- or "Striver" -- dove 23 times into the depths of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean with researchers on board, according to the study in the journal Nature.

Last year, the Chinese submersible "Fendouzhe" -- or "Striver" -- dove 23 times into the depths of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean with researchers on board, according to the study in the journal Nature. AP file photo PARIS: A Chinese submersible has discovered thousands of worms and molluscs nearly 10 kilometres (six miles) below sea level in the Mariana Trench, the deepest colony of creatures ever observed, a study revealed on Wednesday.The discovery in Earth's deepest underwater valley suggests that there could be much more life thriving in the hostile conditions at the bottom of our planet's largely unexplored oceans than previously thought, the China-led team of scientists said.Almost all life on Earth is supported by light from the Sun. However, in the total darkness at the bottom of the world, these creatures live off of chemicals such as methane seeping through cracks in the seafloor, a process called chemosynthesis.Last year, the Chinese submersible "Fendouzhe", or "Striver", dove 23 times into the depths of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean with researchers on board, according to the study in the journal Nature.They found colonies of thousands of marine tubeworms and molluscs called bivalves at depths ranging from 2,500 to 9,533 metres (8,200 to 31,000 feet) deep. Video released alongside the study showed fields of tubeworms, which grew up to 30 centimetres (12 inches) long, as well as piles of molluscs and clams. Spiky crustaceans, free-floating marine worms, sea cucumbers, feathery-armed sea lilies and other invertebrates were also recorded in the depths.The study marked "the discovery of the deepest and the most extensive chemosynthesis-based communities known to exist on Earth," its authors said.Given that other ocean trenches are similar, "such chemosynthesis-based communities might be more widespread than previously anticipated," they added.The researchers said they also found "compelling evidence" that methane was being produced by microbes, with the tubeworms tending to cluster around microbial mats that resemble snow. Previous studies have found thriving communities of single-cell organisms on the ocean floor, but few large animals.But a remotely operated vehicle discovered tubeworms and other marine invertebrates living in hydrothermal vents in the crust below the seafloor two kilometres deep in the Pacific, research said last year.Pressure rising The new study was published as nations wrangle over the contentious issue of deep-sea mining. China, the United States and others have expressed interest in mining the depths for valuable minerals.Ocean scientists warn that mining the little-explored seafloor, one of the last wild zones on the planet, could decimate fragile ecosystems that are not yet well understood.Despite recent talks, the International Seabed Authority -- which oversees deep-sea mining in international waters -- has yet to adopt long-awaited rules governing the industry. Chinese media has previously reported that the Fendouzhe submersible mission will conduct research on "deep-sea materials".Only a handful of people have ever visited the bottom of the Mariana Trench, which is a crescent-shaped depression in the Earth's crust that is deeper than Mount Everest is high.The first explorers visited the trench in 1960 on a brief expedition.But after that, there were no missions until Hollywood director James Cameron made the first solo trip to the bottom in 2012, describing a "desolate" and "alien" environment.The water pressure at the bottom of the trench is a crushing eight tons per square inch, more than a thousand times the atmospheric pressure at sea level.Discover stories of India’s leading eco-innovators at Ecopreneur Honours 2025End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksKamala HarrisBogota AirportUS Oil ReserveTrump TariffsUPI New RulesStarlink SatelliteJulia HymanTop TrendingTravis KelceTom BradyBengaluru Boy Kidnap MurderCBSE Class 10th Sample PapersHow new nep rule worksYuzvendra Chahal DatingStephen CurryJoe BurrowBlake LivelyTravis KelceTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteSSC exam 2025 glitches spark massive nationwide protest: Here’s why #SSCMisManagement is trending on social mediaCAT 2025 registration begins at iimcat.ac.in: Check direct link to apply online hereAP Police Constable final result 2025 released at slprb.ap.gov.in; check direct link hereIs Yuzvendra Chahal dating RJ Mahvash?

An aerial view of the Don River in the newly unveiled Biidaasige Park, part of Toronto's Port Lands Flood Protection Project, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (AFP photo) TORONTO: The spur to build Toronto's billion-dollar-plus flood prevention project dates back to a devastating hurricane in 1954, but planners say its urgency was reinforced by the recent tragic flooding in Texas.The Port Lands project has, in part, reversed a consequence of industrialization by reconnecting Lake Ontario with the Don River, more than a century after they were severed to create an industrial area.Chris Glaisek, chief planning officer at the municipal body Waterfront Toronto, said the idea was to "heal the land from the way it was repurposed 100 years ago," with a focus on "flood protection and naturalization."The complex project -- one of the largest in Toronto's history with a cost of Can$1.4 billion (US$1 billion) -- included digging a river valley and the creation of two new river outlets, with wetlands and marshes to absorb excess water during extreme storms.The mouth of the Don River was once the Great Lakes system's largest fresh water marsh, a rich habitat and vital food resource for Indigenous people before colonization.But Toronto, like many North American cities, saw industrial growth in the late 19th Century.Much of the marsh was drained and filled in to make room for a port industrial area, while the river was re-routed into a man-made channel. The Port Lands never thrived as an industrial area, leaving a vast stretch of eastern downtown under-used, and the Don River became polluted. "It was really dirty, it was foul, it was terrible," Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow said recently. - Hurricane Hazel -On October 15, 1954 Hurricane Hazel hit Toronto, after hammering parts of the Caribbean and eastern United States.It killed 81 people across the Greater Toronto Area and served as catalyst for the city to get serious about flood protection. Hazel flooded the Humber River, in western Toronto, but Glaisek said "it was understood at the time that that same amount of rainfall, had it landed on the (eastern) Don, would have done a comparable amount of damage." He called Hazel an initial "impetus" to re-naturalize the Port Lands, but rising awareness over the past two decades about the causal link between climate change and extreme floods helped advance the project. - 'Duty bound' -To reclaim the Port Lands, Toronto partnered with the US-based landscape architecture firm Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, which has worked on the Brooklyn Bridge Park and the Obama Presidential Center in Chicago.Laura Solano, the lead designer, said the project was "duty bound to address catastrophic flooding," but stressed it offered "much more."Because the area has been reformed to cope with flood waters, parts have been declared safe for new housing -- an urgent need in the expensive metropolis.There is also a new park, trails and people can canoe or kayak through the rehabilitated Don.Solano stressed Toronto's initial decision to alter the area was consistent with the times, when North American cities moved to "industrialize their waters...to raise their economic position."But now, "every city is looking to reclaim their waters," she told AFP. The Port Lands "shows the world that it's possible to fix the past and turn deficit and remnant industrial lands into living and breathing infrastructure."- 'The river is going to flood' -As Glaisek described the project, he stood on a bank that would, by design, be under water during a major storm."It's all planned so that it can flood, the water level can rise, the river can get about three, maybe four times wider than it is now, absorb all of that volume of water," he said. "When the storm event subsides, it will shrink back down to this."It's a planning approach that recognizes "we're seeing more and more of these events.""Like in Texas, you see very tragic outcomes when you haven't really tried to plan for nature," he told AFP, referring to flash floods in early July that killed at least 135 people. He urged planners to "reposition" their relationship to nature and ditch the mindset that "humans (can) control everything.""Let's acknowledge the river is going to flood. Let's build the space for it." bs/desEnd of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousWhen Mrunal Thakur wore the most wedding-worthy Banarasi sareeLifestyle10 Indian baby names inspired by Indian languages and scriptsLifestyle10 interesting facts about Kiran Desai and her Booker Prize 2025 longlisted bookLifestyleShobha Shetty’s top 10 half-saree lookstv8 air-purifying plants for your homeLifestyleIn pics: Glamorous looks of actress Bindhu MadhavitvTake cues from Rashmika Mandanna's traditional attires this ShravanEntertainmentKnow the pros and cons of using derma rollers for faster hair growthLifestyleSai Pallavi and her love for eyelinersEntertainment10 most-friendly animals in India!Lifestyle Next123 Photostories  Priyanka Chopra said NO to these 5 hit films - Guess who got them insteadBehind the villain’s mask, Ranjeet’s real story will surprise you5 miracle oils that can actually help grow hair on bald patchesKidney vs Gallbladder stones: What's the difference and 5 very early symptoms you shouldn’t ignoreWhy are Guppy and Swordtail fish ideal starter options for new aquarists5 Friendship Day-perfect destinations in India to reconnect with your old buddiesGrow these 5 vegetables in pots – No backyard neededNo bad time to travel: 7 Indian destinations that are great year-roundTop 5 foods for muscle recoveryTrain the brain to love discipline: 7 habits that can help123Hot PicksMeteor ShowersOperation MahadevP&G CEOIndia US TradeLenskart IPOTCS share priceJulia HymanTop TrendingTaylor SwiftNBA Trade RumorsNazem KadriJarred VanderbiltBoeing 787 DreamlinerYankee Stadium Viral videoDeandre AytonVanessa BryantIndia US Trade AgreementNHL Trade RumorsTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteLondon airspace shut: All outbound UK flights hit by air traffic control 'technical issue'Saudi Arabia’s EV maker, Lucid, breaks world record with 1,205 km drive across Europe in single chargeSaikat Chakrabarti vs Nancy Pelosi: Meet Indian-American challenging Godmother of Dem Party — in her own backyardExplained: Why a Russian earthquake triggered tsunami alerts in Hawaii, Japan, and the US West CoastUAE: Will influencers need an advertiser permit to post on social media?

Kanchan trees, nature-based solution to riverbank erosion in Majuli (Image: ANI) MAJULI: In the village of Pathorichuk, Majuli, Assam, local residents have discovered a remarkable way to combat riverbank erosion by planting Kanchan trees along the Brahmaputra River. This sustainable and eco-friendly approach has proven to be a natural shield against the relentless forces of erosion.Each year, the mighty Brahmaputra, along with its tributaries Subansiri and Kherkatia, relentlessly eats away at Majuli's landmass, threatening its very existence. Traditional anti-erosion measures such as RCC porcupines and geo-bags have only offered temporary relief and have largely failed to provide long-term protection.However, the residents of Pathorichuk have discovered a sustainable and local solution. By planting large numbers of Kanchan trees along the riverbanks, the village has managed to significantly reduce the impact of erosion in the area. The deep-rooted trees not only hold the soil together but also act as a natural barrier against the strong river currents.The success of Pathorichuk village presents a compelling case for the broader adoption of ecological methods to combat erosion. Locals now urge the government, administrative bodies, and concerned departments to consider the large-scale plantation of Kanchan trees across erosion-prone areas of Majuli.If replicated effectively, this eco-friendly and cost-effective model could play a key role in safeguarding Majuli, the world's largest river island, from further disappearance. While speaking to ANI, Nirab Tai, a local from Pathorichuk village, said, "We used to face heavy erosion in the past, and our village was constantly under threat. Around 20 years ago, our elders planted these trees to prevent erosion. Since then, the erosion has completely stopped, and our village is now safe. These trees are like blessings to us, they protect us. We call them "Kanchan trees" in Assamese.""I believe that if Kanchan trees are planted along the banks of the Brahmaputra River, there will be no erosion, and all the villages near the river will be protected. These trees grow very rapidly. You don't have to do much, just plant a branch of the Kanchan tree, and it will grow, especially quickly during the monsoon season. From a single tree, many more Kanchan trees will grow.The RCC porcupines used by the government to control erosion often get submerged during the monsoon season. But these trees are doing a tremendous job. They not only protect the land but also provide a healthy environment, shade, and natural beauty." Another local, Krishna Payeng, told ANI, "These trees grow from branches. When planted near rivers, they gradually grow massively and help control soil erosion. The government should consider this seriously. Along with geo bags, if we plant Kanchan trees, erosion can be effectively controlled."He suggested distributing these trees among students and highlighting their benefits on World Environment Day."These trees should be distributed among students, and they should be informed about their benefits. On World Environment Day, the positive impact of these trees should be highlighted. I sincerely request the government to look into this matter and plant Kanchan trees in areas highly affected by erosion, not only in our country, but across the world."The success of Pathorichuk village's initiative presents a compelling case for adopting ecological methods to combat erosion. By embracing nature-based solutions, we can protect the world's largest river island, Majuli, from further disappearance.

Early Hawaiian petroglyphs on a beach are visible again with changing tides and shifting sands
Ancient Hawaiian petroglyphs, featuring human-like figures, have resurfaced on Oahu's Waianae coast after years of being hidden by sand. Seasonal ocean swells revealed the panel of over two dozen images, dating back at least 500 years. Glen Kila, a Native Hawaiian cultural expert, believes this reappearance signals a message from ancestors about rising sea levels.

Early Hawaiian petroglyphs on a beach are visible again (Image: AP) WAIANAE: Hawaiian petroglyphs dating back at least a half-millennium are visible on Oahu for the first time in years, thanks to seasonal ocean swells that peel away sand covering a panel of more than two dozen images of mostly human-looking stick figures.  The petroglyphs are easy to spot during low tide when gentle waves ebb and flow over slippery, neon-green algae growing on a stretch of sandstone. This is the first time the entire panel of petroglyphs are visible since they were first spotted nine years ago by two guests staying at a bayside US Army recreation centre in Waianae, about an hour's drive from Honolulu. Native Hawaiian cultural practitioner Glen Kila, who traces his lineage to the aboriginal families of this coastal Hawaii community, said he believes the resurfacing of the traditional marvels are his ancestors sending a message. "It's telling the community that the ocean is rising," said Kila, a recognized expert on the local culture and history of Waianae who is consulting with the Army on the protection of the petroglyphs.  Army officials are trying to balance protecting the petroglyphs with their accessibility on a public beach.  John and Sandy Stone consulted tide charts and drove about 30 minutes from their home early Tuesday to get a glimpse after a watching a local TV report about the petroglyphs.  "It was so interesting to touch them," said John Stone, who splits his time between Hawaii and California. "It felt interesting to kind of have a connection with the past like that."  It is difficult to date petroglyphs, but an archaeological site in the area is from about 600 years ago, said Laura Gilda, an archaeologist with US Army Garrison Hawaii. According to Kila, Hawaiians arrived in Waianae at least 1,000 years ago.  Shift in waves caused petroglyphs to appear The beach here fluctuates in size and profile each year, with low-pressure weather systems that form in the eastern Pacific between May and November causing waves that cut away loose sand from shorelines and redeposit them further out, according to an Army report on the petroglyphs. That shift is likely what causes their temporary exposure.  Archaeologists identified a total of 26 petroglyphs. Of the 18 anthropomorphic stick figures, eight are depicted with possible male genitalia and the remainder are of undetermined gender, the report said.  The entire panel stretches about 115 feet (35 meters) long, Gilda said.  When the petroglyphs first reemerged in July 2016, it was after late spring and early summer storms, including hurricanes, with a lot of wave action that swept the sand away, Gilda said.  They remained visible for a period and then got covered again.  "So there's been portions that have ... been exposed since then, but this is the first summer that the whole panel has been exposed again," Gilda said.  Petroglyphs are telling a religious story, expert says Based on the teachings Kila learned, the lineal petroglyphs appear to be telling a religious, ceremonial story. He interprets the largest figure, which appears to include hands and fingers with one arm raised and the other down, to represent the rising and setting sun.  Kila said that when the military in the 1930s took over the area and evicted Native Hawaiians, including his family who lived there for generations, his great-great grandmother refused to leave so his family exchanged mountain lands with a coffee plantation so she could remain near the bay.  In an interview included in the Army's report, he recalled growing up in Waianae without television. So "the ocean and mountains were our playground," he said. The Army recreation centre was off-limits to the public, and the seawall was the barrier between Native Hawaiians and the military, Kila said.  Kila, now 72, recalled that if they walked on top of the wall, they were clubbed and pushed off by military police.  "We were proud and knew where we came from, so we never fostered any hatred for the military because one day we believed that the land will eventually return to us," he said.  Kila, while visiting the petroglyphs earlier this week, told The Associated Press that the Army's protection of them represents a shift in that community relationship.  Officials have been grappling with how to share the petroglyphs with the community while also protecting them, Gilda said.  "How much attention do you want to bring to this area? You don't really want people to go digging for them when they're not exposed," she said. "But they're certainly awesome to come and see on the public beachscape." Donald Kauliʻa, a Native Hawaiian who was born and raised in Waianae, snapped photos of the petroglyphs Tuesday. Seeing them, he said, feels like "validation that our ancestors were from here."End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksParliament Monsoon SessionColumbia UniversityTesla stock earningsSovereign Gold BondsTCS new benching policyRajasthan building collapseRussian Plane MissingTop TrendingHulk Hogan WifeStephen CurryKendrick LamarUGC reformGisele BundchenConnor McDavidSteven OleksyShannon SharpeDwyane Wades WifeDylan HarperTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteBill Gates says: When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is ...TN Class 12th Supply Result 2025 Live: Tamil Nadu HSC results to be declared today, check how to download marksheets onlineUGC, AICTE, NCTE to be scrapped: Will a new super-regulator end the chaos these three could never control?Ciara and baby Amora twin in new adorable photo as fans gush over Russell Wilson's lookalike daughterWho is Hulk Hogan’s wife Sky Daily?

That's according to the international sustainability organization Global Footprint Networkand York University in Toronto, Canada.The day, which is observed annually, comes just over a week earlier than last year's date— mainly due to the fact that oceans can absorb less CO2 than previously reported.We are overconsuming by depleting nature's capital faster than it can replenish, which is visible in deforestation, loss of biodiversity and the accumulation of carbon emissions in the atmosphere. And it is part of a trend that started back in the early 1970s.Mathis Wackernagel, co-founder of the Global Footprint Network, told DW that using too many resources is driving many "environmental ills," and that regularly using more than the planet can naturally reproduce has a cumulative effect. "Even if we keep it at the same level, we increase the ecological debt that the world endures," he said, adding that the ensuing "debt is measurable."Overconsumption is a global problemQatar, Luxembourg and Singapore were first in hitting their respective country overshoot days back in February. The US was not far behind. If everyone on the planet consumed like people in the US, resources would be depleted by March 13. Germany and Poland land on May 3, China and Spain on May 23, South Africa on July 2.Wackernagel said high income "typically leads to higher resource consumption," but added that it is not the only driver.Qatar, with a desert climate with low annual rainfall and intensely hot, humid summers, relies heavily on air conditioning powered by fossil fuel energy. "They have easy access to fossil fuels, so fossil fuel use is cheap and that has a big footprint," he said, adding the country also uses up a lot of resources for the energy intensive process of desalinating seawater.Uruguay, on the other hand, is not projected to start overconsuming until December 17. It has successfully turned to renewable energy to power its grid, relying mainly on hydroelectricity, wind and biomass.Sticking to what Earth can replenishAnd then there are the countries that stay within bounds of the planet's capacity such as India, Kenya and Nigeria, among others. In order to stay within our means, the world's ecological footprint would have to equal the available biocapacity per person on our planet, which currently stands at about 1.5 global hectares.Biocapacity is defined as land and ocean areas that provide resources such as food and timber, can accommodate urban infrastructure and absorb excess CO2. Anything higher than the global available biocapacity per person is overexploiting resources.Germany has about the same amount of biocapacity per person as the global average, but uses about three times more, Wackernagel said.While India, the world's most populous country, uses more than the country itself can renew in a year, globally speaking "the level of consumption is less than one planet," he said, adding that one planet should not be the goal. "There are also other species, so we should probably be below one planet to be robust."Decades of overusing are taking a tollWackernagel said we are taking resources "far beyond what Earth can regenerate" yet have a collective understanding that what we are doing is fine. "But we're fooling ourselves."Paul Shrivastava, co-president of think tank Club of Rome, said it's time to rethink how we understand economies. "We need to change from that extractive mindset of the economy to a regenerative one," he told DW."Mining is a kind of extraction. Oil is a kind of extraction. Once we take it out of the earth, we don't give anything back," he added.Wackernagel said it's not about what we need to give up, but rather how we can prepare ourselves for the future and what will be valuable then.Rather than adjusting economies to reduce overshooting, people are trying to squeeze the last bit out of the toothpaste tube, Wackernagel said."In the United States, where I live, I could see that many of the themes around the elections last year were very overshoot related. For example, the fear of not having enough energy," he said. However, the government has failed to address the problem of overshooting and instead pushed to "drill more holes and get more fossil fuels" out of the ground. How to push back Overshoot Day?The Global Footprint Network has outlined a number of solutions in five key areas to push back the date of Earth Overshoot Day.The energy sector is by far the biggest factor at play: Placing a price on carbon emissions that reflects the true cost of carbon pollution on the planet would help move the date by 63 days.Smart cities with integrated transport systems, advanced energy management and foresight through sensors to regulate energy in buildings could add another 29 days to the calendar.Replacing coal and gas-fired power plants with renewable energy such as solar and wind and generating 75% of electricity from low-carbon sources would move the date by another 26 days.Halving food waste would provide another 13 extra days and replacing 50% of global meat consumption with plant-based alternatives would add seven days from CO2 emissions and land use alone. Just one meatless day per week would add around two days.'Vested interests in maintaining the current system'"There are vested interests in maintaining the current system" such as in fossil fuels, said Shrivastava.And while individual changes such as eating less meat, favouring biking over car rides and vacationing closer to home rank comparatively low on the power of possibility chart, voters have the power to push for systemic changes."We don't control all of that individually, but we can have a say in it and we can talk to the people who have a say in it," said Shrivastava, by engaging in peaceful protests and in supporting local political candidates that have an ecological vision. Such changes will come from the power of the people, he added."Overshoot is the second-largest risk humanity faces this century," Wackernagel said. "The largest one is not to respond."End of ArticleFollow Us On Social MediaHot PicksParliament Monsoon SessionRussia oil sanctionsICICI BankSovereign Gold BondsTCS new benching policyVibrio VulnificusLindsey GrahamTop TrendingShane Taylor RooksNFL NetworkLeBron JamesNHL Trade RumorsConnor McDavidChristian JarosShannon SharpeDwyane Wades WifeFOX Sports Analyst Cris CarterTravis HunterTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteRishabh Pant Injury Recap: ‘He was in a lot of pain’ — Watch dramatic video from Manchester Test'Surreal': Astronomer CEO speaks out about Andy Byron's Coldplay scandal, says company has now become a household nameBill Gates says: When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is ...“My body failed me”: Dwyane Wade’s wife Gabrielle Union opens up about facing “public humiliation” after choosing surrogacyWho is Bryan Johnson: Anti-aging champion who spent $2 million a year on his body now set to shut down or sell age-reversing startup due to financial lossesWorld's largest asset manager BlackRock to employees: You cannot carry your phones and laptops to China, instead …Solar Eclipse on August 2: Why world will be under darkness for over 6 minutes in a rare 100-year phenomenon; is it visible in India?Israel's key airport attacked: Houthi millitants launch missile at Tel Aviv; bombing destroys port's dock againLawsuit or ...: Why Astronomer has not fired HR head Kristin Cabot while CEO Andy Byron resignedWho is Connor Estelle?

Last year, 74% of the growth in electricity generated worldwide was from wind, solar and other green sources, according to the UN's multiagency report, called Seizing the Moment of Opportunity. It found that 92.5% of all new electricity capacity added to the grid worldwide in that time period came from renewables. Meanwhile, sales of electric vehicles are up from 500,000 in 2015 to more than 17 million in 2024. The three cheapest electricity sources globally last year were onshore wind, solar panels and new hydropower, according to an energy cost report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). Solar power now is 41% cheaper and wind power is 53% cheaper globally than the lowest-cost fossil fuel, the reports said. Fossil fuels, which are the chief cause of climate change, include coal, oil and natural gas. "The fossil fuel age is flailing and failing," United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in Tuesday morning speech unveiling the reports. "We are in the dawn of a new energy era. An era where cheap, clean, abundant energy powers a world rich in economic opportunity." "Just follow the money," Guterres said, quoting the reports that showed last year there was $2 trillion in investment in green energy, which is about $800 billion more than in fossil fuels. UN officials say switch to renewables needs to speed up Still, United Nations officials said the switch to renewable energy, while remarkable compared to 10 years ago, is not happening fast enough. The global renewables growth has been mostly in developed countries such as China - where one-tenth of the economy is tied up in green energy - as well as countries such as India and Brazil.  Yet Africa represented less than 2% of the new green energy capacity installed last year despite having great electrification needs, the reports said. United Nations officials blamed the high cost of capital for the Global South. "The Global South must be empowered to generate its own electricity without adding to already unsustainable level of debts," said Bahamian climate scientist Adelle Thomas of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Thomas, who did not work on the reports, added that they debunk the myth that clean energy cannot compete with fossil fuels, instead showing a clean energy future is not just possible but likely inevitable. The UN reports are "right on the money," said University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck, who also wasn't part of the studies. He said the economic tipping point leads to a cycle that keeps driving renewable costs down and makes fossil fuel power less and less desirable. Renewables grow despite high subsidies for fossil fuels And renewables are booming despite fossil fuels getting nearly nine times the government consumption subsidies as they do, Guterres and the reports said. In 2023, global fossil fuel subsidies amounted to $620 billion, compared to $70 billion for renewables, the UN report said. But just as renewables are booming, fossil fuel production globally is still increasing, instead of going down in response. United Nations officials said that's because power demand is increasing overall, spurred by developing countries, artificial intelligence data centers and the need for cooling in an ever warmer world. "A typical AI data center eats up as much electricity as 100,000 homes," Guterres said. "By 2030 data centers could consume as much electricity as all of Japan does today." So Guterres called on the world's major tech firms to power data centers completely with renewables by 2030. Solar and wind power face US cuts to renewable energy programs In the United States, solar and wind power had been growing at a rate of 12.3% per year from 2018 to 2023, the IRENA report said. But since President Donald Trump took office earlier this year, his administration has withdrawn the nation from the landmark Paris climate accord and cut many federal renewable energy programs, with a renewed emphasis on fossil fuels.  Guterres warned nations hanging on to fossil fuels that they were heading down a dangerous path that would make them poorer not richer, without naming the United States specifically. "Countries that cling to fossil fuels are not protecting their economies, they sabotaging them. Driving up costs. Undermining competitiveness. Locking in stranded assets," Guterres said. Renewables are the smart way to go for energy security, Guterres said. With renewables, he said, "there are no price spikes for sunlight. No embargoes on wind."

Mehar’s custom-engineered drone reached this remarkable milestone in an astonishing 0.91 seconds, a feat that not only demonstrates his technical prowess but also sets a new benchmark in the rapidly evolving world of drone technology.Mehar’s journey to this achievement has been anything but straightforward. His fascination with drones began in 8th grade, and this passion has only deepened over the years. With a keen interest in pushing technological boundaries, Mehar embarked on a months-long project to build a drone capable of unparalleled vertical acceleration.“I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of pushing the limits of what drones can do,” Mehar explained. “But breaking a world record wasn’t just about the end result; it was about the process. I wanted to prove that current technology could achieve something extraordinary, but the path to get there was filled with challenges.”The project required Mehar to design, test, and refine multiple drone prototypes. “There were moments when I felt like I was chasing an impossible dream,” Mehar recalled. “I went through countless designs, and many of them failed during testing. Some drones crashed so badly that I had no choice but to go back to the drawing board and start from scratch. Each crash was a setback, but it also sparked new ideas and innovations.”Undeterred by the setbacks, Mehar poured his energy into creating a drone that was not only fast but also aerodynamically optimized. “I spent countless hours on CAD software, meticulously designing and tweaking each component. The goal was to make the drone as streamlined as possible, which led me to shape it like a rocket. This design wasn’t just about aesthetics; it was about reducing drag and maximizing speed.”Mehar’s dedication to his craft paid off in spectacular fashion. “Every failure taught me something valuable,” he said. “It forced me to think creatively and to consider every detail, from the materials used to the weight distribution of the drone. The process was grueling, but it was also incredibly rewarding to see my ideas take flight—literally.”This record-breaking achievement is more than just a personal triumph for Mehar; it has significant implications for the future of drone technology. “The possibilities are endless,” Mehar mused. “High-speed vertical acceleration could revolutionize everything from emergency response to space exploration. This isn’t just about setting a record; it’s about opening doors to new innovations and applications.”Mehar’s groundbreaking work has already begun to inspire others in the drone community and beyond. “I hope this accomplishment encourages other young innovators to push their own boundaries,” he said. “Technology is advancing rapidly, and there’s so much potential waiting to be unlocked. I’m excited to see where we can go from here.”As Mehar looks ahead, the sky is truly the limit.

The formats mentioned above are most prominently used globally. JPGs can be different things like signatures required to sign documents or screenshots of an instruction manual. When converting JPG to PDF and then sharing it, you want to maintain the quality of the image. It also becomes highly convenient for the end-user to access the PDF file.There are a plethora of tools to convert JPG to PDF. Nonetheless, a tool that has gained a lot of trust in the segment is Adobe Acrobat. It simply converts any file from JPG to PDF without altering the quality. Moving ahead, we will step by step explain how you can use Adobe Acrobat to convert an image to PDF.Basic Definition of JPG and PDFJPG or JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, and it is mostly used for compressing highly detailed images, making them smaller for increasing their shareability.

Another highlight is that it also maintains the quality of images when the size (dimensions) is increased.Why should you convert JPG to PDF? Regarding size, JPG files take less space than PDFs. However, PDF files are easily manageable, and you can also use the other services in Adobe Document Cloud to make sharing, uploading, and managing super easy. PDF will have the upper hand over JPG because the former is easily editable. Any JPG converted to PDF can be divided into different components for editing.

Choose a plan - You can also opt for the free plan if you prefer. Apart from that, the subscription can be purchased at minimal prices. Tap on the plus button and the right bottom of the screen and then tap on the open file. Give the application storage access to get your files for editing. Select the file you want to convert. Now, you will see the 'Convert PDF' button under the image; tap on it. Your image will be successfully converted to PDF. Note: On the smartphone version, you cannot use the Image to PDF convert feature for free.Frequently asked questionsCan you convert JPG to PDF for free?Yes, there are multiple online and offline tools that can be used to convert any image to PDF without spending a single dime.How to convert JPG into editable PDF?There are not many tools available in the market that offer accurate PDF editing features such as Adobe Acrobat.

Doordarshan will telecast live the Mangala, Shringaar, Rajbhog, Sandhya, and Shayan Aartis offered to the Ram Lalla idol at the Ayodhya Ram temple on DD National, connecting devotees who can't visit the temple. National broadcaster Doordarshan has good news for Lord Ram Devotees. Doordarshan has announced that it will telecast live the morning prayers offered to the Ram Lalla idol at the Ram Temple in Ayodhya every day.Doordarshan has shared the same in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Doordarshan said that the morning aarti offered to Ram Lalla will be telecast live on DD National every morning from 6:30 am.The national broadcaster said that the decision to telecast the morning aarti live every day was taken with the aim of connecting devotees of Lord Ram, especially after the temple was inaugurated less than two months ago in a grand ceremony and everyone can't visit the temple in person. The Aarti will be telecast simultaneously on DD’s YouTube channel also.Secondly, the decision was taken because the Trust doesn’t have logistical arrangements as of now for a live broadcast. Therefore, DD will be posting a two-three-member crew on the temple premises for the coverage of the daily ritual.DD's announcement to telecast the Aarti live for 30 minutes every morning comes after getting the go-ahead from the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust for the same. Initially, DD will air the “Mangala aarti” for a few months, and then, the Ram Temple Trust will take a call on how to take it forward.6 Aartis daily at the Ayodhya Ram templeThere are 6 aartis of Ram Lalla held daily in Ayodhya Ram temple. These include Mangala Aarti at 4:30 am, Shringaar Aarti at 6:30 am, Rajbhog Aarti at 12 noon, Utthapan Aarti at 2 pm, Sandhya Aarti at 7 pm, and Shayan Aarti at 10 pm.Giving directions to devotees for Aarti, the temple trust said, "Entry for Mangala Aarti at 4 AM, Shringar Aarti at 6:15 AM, and Shayan Aarti at 10 PM is possible only with an entry pass. No entry passes required for other Aartis."Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust advisory to devoteesIn an advisory to devotees coming for darshan at the temple, the Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra said, "Devotees can enter the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir for Darshan from 6:30 AM to 9:30 PM. The entire process from entry to exit after Darshan at the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir is extremely simple and convenient. Typically, devotees can have a smooth Darshan of Prabhu Shri Ram Lalla Sarkar within 60 to 75 minutes."The temple trust advised devotees to leave their mobile phones, footwear, purses and other personal items outside the Mandir premises for their convenience and to save time.It has also asked devotees not to bring flowers, garlands, Prasad to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

The design aims to eliminate the hinge crease and reduce the device's thickness while offering added benefits and durability. However, its practicality remains uncertain. Microsoft discontinues Surface Duo smartphones but files a patent for a new foldable device with a single hinge system called 'spine cover plate'. The design aims to eliminate the hinge crease and reduce the device's thickness while offering added benefits and durability. However, its practicality remains uncertain. Microsoft did not get the success it was anticipating with its Android-powered Surface Duo-series smartphones. The company has discontinued the lineup after the Duo 2. But, this does not mean the company has stopped trying. A new patent application filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29, reveals that the company is working on another foldable or dual-display mobile device.The patent application describes the company’s take on the foldable smartphone concept with single hinge technology called “spine cover plate”.Next Microsoft smartphones could feature a Galaxy Z Fold-like designAccording to the patent application, the phone could feature a “flexible display” in a bookstyle design similar to Galaxy Z Fold decies. However, the entire focus is on the spine cover plate mechanism which is aimed at protecting the single-hinge system of the device by covering the structural element. The differentiating factor between the regular hinge and Microsoft’s design is that the spine cover adjusts automatically during the opening and closing of the phone to prevent any unnecessary gaps around the hinge to protect it from dust as well as water. Currently, Samsung’s design offers an IPX8 rating which makes their foldables water-resistant only.The patent further mentions that the new hinge mechanism could allow Microsoft to eliminate the hinge crease less visible than the current options available in the market. Moreover, Microsoft has also mentioned techniques that could allow them to reduce the overall thickness of the foldable smartphone by allowing the spine cover plate to move closer to the device’s hinge when folded. “By retracting the spine cover plate toward the central spine as the first display-supporting frame and the second display-supporting frame are rotated into a face-to-face orientation, the width of the folded computing device is reduced, thereby enabling easier and more comfortable handling of the device, such as with one hand,” Microsoft noted in the patent.Interesting idea, but practicality is a question markThe entire smartphone market is searching for a way to eliminate the foldable crease from their smartphones. Some brands have already implemented the water-drop folding mechanism to reduce it, but there’s nothing like a crease-free foldable out there. Apart from that, the durability quotient of foldable is also important considering all the movable parts these phones have. That said, adding another layer or a movable part on top of the entire foldable mechanism does not appear like a wise move despite the added benefits and durability Microsoft has explained in the patent application.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Initiatives include partnering with the Election Commission, prioritizing trusted content on YouTube, and implementing advertising policies for transparency. Measures against AI-generated content are also taken. Google has announced a series of initiatives aimed at supporting the democratic process and safeguarding its platforms from abuse during the upcoming Indian General Election. With millions of eligible voters heading to the polls, the tech giant has said that recognises its responsibility to connect users with reliable information and counter the spread of misinformation, including AI-generated content.Easy access to voting information on Search and YouTubeGoogle has mentioned that its primary focus is on providing easy access to authoritative information from trusted sources.The company has also partnered with the Election Commission of India to showcase critical details on Google Search and YouTube, such as how to register and vote, in English and Hindi. Apart from this, YouTube’s recommendation system will prioritise trusted content during the election season. Additionally, YouTube’s homepage will prominently showcase trusted content along with an “Up Next” panel to make election-related details easily available for users. YouTube will also highlight content from trusted sources during key moments through its Top News and Breaking News as well as a news watch page. Moreover, the tech giant has also set up information panels that indicate funding sources from publishers that receive public or government funding and information panels that provide topical context for topics prone to misinformation. Safeguarding misinformationTo protect the integrity of the electoral process and to protect its products and services from abuse, Google has re-inforced its existing policies to keep its products and platforms safe while curbing misinformation at the same time. Also, the policies apply to all users, irrespective of the content type. The company has employed a combination of human reviewers and artificial intelligence models to identify and remove content that violates these policies. Google's AI capabilities are enhancing its abuse-fighting efforts, enabling faster action against emerging threats.Advertising during election campaignsTo keep things transparent when it comes to election advertising, the company requires advertisers to undergo identity verification and provide necessary certifications from the Election Commission. Election ads must also include disclosures indicating the advertiser's identity and location. Google maintains a searchable hub for all election ads, providing insights into the advertisers and their spending.Restricting AI-generated contentGoogle has also taken some steps to help identify AI-generated content through new tools and policies. The company has introduced disclosure requirements for election ads containing synthetic content and will soon require creators on YouTube to label realistic altered or synthetic content. The new ad policies prohibit the use of manipulated media to mislead people, like deepfakes or doctored content.Google has also implemented restrictions to Gemini on the types of election-related queries it will respond to and has also prioritised the provision of high-quality information. Additional features, such as the "About this Image" tool in Search and digital watermarking for AI-generated images, aim to provide users with context and assess credibility.Furthermore, Google has joined the C2PA coalition, a cross-industry effort to provide transparency and context for AI-generated content. The company has confirmed the deployment of technology to counter harmful AI-generated content aimed at deceiving voters during the 2024 elections.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

TSMC's stock rallied, elevating its market capitalisation to a record, making it higher than Broadcom. Analysts expect TSMC to further advance amid surging AI-related revenue and strong pricing power.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has reclaimed a spot in the list of the world’s 10 most valuable companies, riding the optimism of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom in the tech industry that pushed its stock to record levels.According to a report by Bloomberg, TSMC’s stock rallied 14% last week, elevating the chipmaker’s market capitalisation to a record, before a 2% decline in early trading on Monday (March 11), pared it to $634 billion. However, the decline didn’t impact the company much as it still has a market share higher than that of Broadcom, the report noted.What analysts have to sayAnalysts from Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. expect the semiconductor giant – that has Apple, Nvidia and Qualcomm as its customers – to advance further amid surging AI-related revenue and strong pricing power. “Generative AI semi is an obvious growth driver for TSMC,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Charlie Chan wrote in a note last week. The company’s overseas expansion also helps mitigate geopolitical concerns, they said.TSMC’s revenue gained 9.4% in the first two months of 2024 as demand for high-end chips increased due to a wave of activity in AI.Nvidia gets ‘AI boost’This is not the first time this year that a chip company has seen its stock on an upward spiral. This year, Nvidia was among the companies that got a boost by a frenzy around generative AI.In the last month, Nvidia stock price has risen over 20% while in the last six months, it has risen over 90%. Moreover, in the last one year, Nvidia stock price has appreciated from $234.36 per share level to $875.28 per share mark – registering a 275% jump.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

The update combines gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer data, reducing magnetic interference and benefiting Google Maps and third-party apps on Android 5.0 or above. Google Maps is updating its Fused Orientation Provider (FOP) API to improve direction accuracy in busy areas. The update combines gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer data, reducing magnetic interference and benefiting Google Maps and third-party apps on Android 5.0 or above. We keep hearing about Google Maps fiasco from across the globe where it directed people in some odd direction and eventually got them stuck in a ‘worst case scenario’. Now a new post published on the Android Developers blog gives an insight about Maps getting a new update to better with directions. The post talks about a potential upgrade that Maps will be getting with the Fused Orientation Provider (FOP) API that aims to make the ‘orientation’ detection better on Android devices, irrespective of the hardware used by different OEMs on their devices. According to the post, the update will make Maps interpret the directions better to make it more accurate by combining the gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer data. However, this idea of Google using data from all the sensors isn’t new, the company has used the API before, but the update will make better magnetic interference. As per the post, the changes will not only apply to Google Maps but also third-party apps that rely on Google Maps to offer navigational data. It is to be noted that the update will be done with internals of the Google Maps, it won’t affect the user interface or the layout of the app. Also, the updated API will be rolled out from the server side or via the app update in Android devices running Android 5.0 or above. How it will affect usersAs mentioned, the update won’t change anything in terms of the app’s design or user interface. The changes are internal in the form of API which will be pushed automatically via the update. That said, the update is set to make it better with directions, especially in busy areas.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Musk announces xAI open sourcing Grok chatbot. OpenAI CEO Altman takes a dig at Musk's chatbot. Musk, obviously didn't like the jab and replied with a long-ish message saying “GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.”  Elon Musk has been extremely critical of ChatGPT maker OpenAI for deviating from its mission to develop AI for the benefit of humanity and taking a profit-making path. He has advocated that artificial intelligence (AI) should be accessible for all, and he has now announced that his AI startup xAI will open source Grok chatbot this week.“This week, @xAI will open source Grok,” Musk said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).In simpler words, open-sourcing a software, like a chatbot, means that the software projects are redistributable as all source code is accessible by everyone. One of the advantages of having open source software is that it provides flexibility to an enterprise to have multiple ways of fixing a problem rather than waiting for an internal team to provide a solution.“OpenAI is a lie”Meanwhile, a user suggested that OpenAI should do the same.“OpenAI should do the same if they are ‘open’ that is,” the user said. Musk replied, “OpenAI is a lie.”Musk wants AI technology to be open-source Musk had floated the idea of open-sourcing AI during a podcast in November last year. In a podcast with Lex Fridman, Musk suggested that he likes the idea of open-source AI. “I am generally in favour of open sourcing, like biassed towards open sourcing,” he said.His comments came soon after his AI company called xAI released Grok, its chatbot, which reportedly took four months to build. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was quick to take a dig at this and shared a post in which he built Grok with a single prompt on GPT Builder."GPTs can save a lot of effort:” he said.Musk, obviously didn't like the jab and replied with a long-ish message saying “GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.” About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Ruby Johnson filed a lawsuit against Detective Gary Staab and Sgt. Gregory Buschy.  Apple's Find My app has cost the city of Denver, US $3.76 million in compensation and damages. In 2022, the city’s police wrongly raided and ransacked an elderly woman's home looking for a stolen truck and guns. According to a report by CNN, Denver police were seeking to recover a stolen truck loaded with guns, ammo and cash. For this, the police used Apple's Find My technology on another iPhone to locate the vehicle.However, the police picked the wrong house out of a fairly wide area to storm in and catch the thieves. Due to this misplaced raid, 78-year-old Ruby Johnson filed a lawsuit against the police. As compensation, the city will be paying Johnson a $3.76 million award. Moreover, the defendant officers — Detective Gary Staab and Sgt. Gregory Buschy — were also sued as an individual. Denver police had previously cleared both men of wrongdoing, but the jury disagreed.How Apple’s Find My app played a roleThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) brought the case on behalf of Johnson. The lawsuit mentioned that the raid was conducted based on an “alleged location ping from an iPhone's Find My app that the officers did not understand and for which they had no training." As per the complaint, the police relied on a "Find My" ping from an iPhone 11 that was probably still in the stolen truck. However, the area identified included parts of six other properties across parts of four city blocks.In a statement, Johnson's attorney Tim Macdonald said: “We are disturbed by the lack of training or policy changes and hope that the amount of the punitive damages award will send a strong message that the police department must take seriously the constitutional rights of its residents.” The ACLU and the jury concluded that the two police officers who ordered the raid had no reason to single out Johnson's house as the target. Also, the officers have to pay nearly $1.25 million each in punitive and compensatory damages. A Denver District Court clerk noted that the city has not yet filed an appeal of the verdict.About the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

A bill to sell TikTok is introduced, backed by President Biden. Kotick discussed acquisition with OpenAI head. Activision Blizzard faced a lawsuit. Concerns about data privacy and ties to China persist. TikTok urges American users to support it.  Bobby Kotick, the former head of Activision Blizzard, is reportedly considering buying TikTok, as the app could be banned in the United States. The Wall Street Journal reports that Kotick has talked to ByteDance, the company that owns TikTok, about buying the app, which could cost hundreds of billions of dollars.This comes as US lawmakers introduce a new bill that would make ByteDance sell TikTok within six months or stop it from being available in US app stores.President Joe Biden has said he would approve the bill if it passes in Congress.The Wall Street Journal report adds that Kotick, the head of OpenAI, Sam Altman, discussed teaming up to buy TikTok at a dinner last week. Kotick's interest in TikTok follows a rough end to his 30 years leading Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft acquired last year. The company faced a lawsuit saying it allowed sexual harassment and discrimination under Kotick's leadership. The Wall Street Journal also said Kotick knew about bad behaviour and didn't tell the board everything. Kotick was accused of harassment, but Activision Blizzard said the report was "misleading."Lawmakers are worried about data privacy and TikTok's ties to China. US President Biden, whose administration has banned the app already on state devices, has expressed his support for banning the app in the US. However, former President Donald Trump, who once wanted to ban TikTok, has changed his mind, saying a ban would help TikTok's rivals, like Facebook and YouTube. As the bill against TikTok gains support, the app has asked its American users to speak up for it, sending messages telling users to call their representatives. The bill, which passed a committee last week, is expected to be approved when the House votes on Wednesday. If it passes, it will then go to the Senate, and then the bill will be signed by the President of the US.Former Activision boss reportedly wants to buy TikTokAbout the AuthorTOI Tech DeskThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Reason is said to be delay in the delivery of two supercomputers by the French company to Indian weather forecasting institutes. According to a report in news agency PTI, the Earth Sciences Ministry had ordered two supercomputers worth $100 million from French firm Eviden, of the Atos Group, last year to enhance the computing capabilities of its institutions -- the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM)."I am more upset because the target we set was December. The Union Cabinet had already approved purchasing the supercomputer. We have only four petaflop capacity. We want to install up to 18 petaflop capacity," Rijiju told PTI in a video interview.He said that the French company ran into some financial trouble and wanted the government to make payment to its subsidiary.Minister says that the delay is causing him "worry"Rijiju said that the delay has caused him lots of worry as the company has overshot the timeline. "But I think we will sort it out soon," he said, adding that the government wanted to be "very correct in our position legally"."We are ready to release the money because we want the machine immediately. The only problem is the amount is not small. So if we pay now, if the company is bankrupt or something happens, who will bail out," the minister said.Rijiju further added that the government was taking some steps to speed up the delivery of the supercomputer but did not elaborate. "But I hope the French government will also intervene because we have a good understanding and a very good relationship with the French government."Since it is a high-cost equipment, we want to ensure that the transaction happens duly and properly," he said."From outside, everything's ready. It is only the problem with the main company. They want us to pay their subsidiary. We will pay only to a company whom we have entered an MoU with," Rijiju said.The supercomputing system, based on Eviden's BullSequana XH2000, is said to have a combined power capacity of up to 21.3 petaflops.Supercomputer at IITMThe supercomputer at the Pune-based IITM will provide 13 petaflops of computing power for atmosphere and climate research.

Why did this PhD student from Tamil Nadu refuse to receive her degree from Governor RN Ravi at MSU convocation?
Jean Joseph, a PhD graduate, protested at Manonmaniam Sundaranar University's convocation by refusing to accept her degree from Tamil Nadu Governor R.N. Ravi.

Ravi. She cited Ravi's lack of contribution to Tamil Nadu's development and disregard for Tamil identity as reasons. Her act has ignited discussions about student autonomy and political expression within academic ceremonies.  A bold act of protest at Manonmaniam Sundaranar University’s 32nd convocation has become a talking point across Tamil Nadu. Jean Joseph, a PhD graduate in Human Resource Management, chose not to receive her degree from Tamil Nadu Governor R N Ravi, challenging the long-standing tradition of students collecting degrees directly from the Governor, who is also the university’s chancellor.Convocation ceremony in focusThe convocation, held at V.O.C. Auditorium, conferred degrees to 37,376 students from 104 affiliated colleges and the university, spanning bachelor’s, master’s, MPhil, and PhD programmes. 759 graduates were present to receive their degrees in person, including 650 PhD scholars, and 109 medallists were honoured for academic excellence. The ceremony featured a convocation address by A P Dimri, Director of the Indian Institute of Geomagnetism, under the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India.Traditionally, students pose for photographs with the Governor after receiving their certificates. In a surprising move, Joseph accepted her degree from Vice-Chancellor N Chandrasekar instead, bypassing Governor Ravi entirely.A stand for choice and Tamil identityDuring the convocation, Joseph bypassed Governor R N Ravi and chose to receive her degree from Vice-Chancellor N Chandrasekar, breaking with the traditional practice of posing with the Governor. Explaining her decision to TNN, she said she acted “only as a way to register protest against the governor, who has not contributed anything to the development of the state and has shown he is against the welfare of the people of Tamil Nadu.” Adding to this, she mentioned that she “believes in the 'Dravidian' model of governance.”She added further in a statement to ANI, highlighting her perspective on student choice and respect for Tamil culture: “I believe the Governor has done nothing for Tamil Nadu or the Tamil language. Many others, such as the Chief Minister or the Education Minister, are more qualified to present degrees. It should be the student’s choice. My fellow students appreciated my decision. If it were wrong, no one would have congratulated me. I don’t want to take my degree from someone who does not respect our land, language, and identity.”Joseph emphasised that her protest was political in principle, not personal, and many students reportedly supported her for taking a stand for Tamil identity, language, and governance.Academic journeyJean Joseph has an impressive academic background. She completed her B.Com at Hindu College, Nagercoil, followed by an MCA at Mepco College, Sivakasi, before earning her PhD in Human Resource Management from MSU. Her research focused on human resource strategies and organisational development, preparing her for a career in academia and organisational consulting.Reactions and wider debateThe incident has sparked discussions across campuses about student autonomy, ceremonial traditions, and political expression. As reported by TNN, BJP’s Tamil Nadu president, K Annamalai, criticised the move as “unnecessary and useless drama” aimed at political gain. Joseph’s husband, Rajan, serves as the district student wing secretary of the DMK, adding a political dimension to her action.Many educators and students see her decision as an example of how ceremonial traditions can intersect with political awareness and personal principles, particularly in a state like Tamil Nadu, where student activism and regional pride have long been influential.Joseph’s stand has become a reference point for discussions on whether students should have the freedom to choose from whom they receive their degrees, a debate that could shape convocation practices in the years to come.Ready to navigate global policies?

Independence Day 2025 speech ideas and tips for school students (Image: iStock) This August 15, India celebrates its 79th Independence Day — 78 years since we swapped the Union Jack for the tricolour and began scripting our own story. From Dandi to digital, the story has been one of grit, chaos, reinvention and the occasional leap of brilliance.Independence Day is not just a day off school or an excuse for laddoos. It is a microphone in your hand, a stage in front of your peers and a chance to prove that “freedom” is not just a chapter in a History textbook. Freedom is more than “freedom from” — it is “freedom to.” Freedom to rise above, to build something better, to belong to an India still under construction and here’s the thing: You — in those perfectly ironed uniforms — are both the legacy of those who dreamt and the future of those who dared.So, if you are speaking this morning, skip the predictable script everyone’s heard since the 90s. Don’t just recite 1947’s headlines, talk about the India you see, the India you want and the India you will help build. Make it personal, make it real and make it worth remembering.If you want your Independence Day speech to actually stand out, here are 10 ideas that can help you ditch the clichés and make every word count.1. Independence Beyond Flags and ParadesBest Independence Day speeches for students (Image: iStock)Freedom is more than flag-hoisting ceremonies and patriotic songs. It is about whether every citizen can speak, work and live without fear. Your speech can explore if our celebrations match the freedoms we promise ourselves and what role students can play in making independence a lived reality, not just an annual ritual.2. From Dandi to Digital: Has India Kept the Spirit Alive?Mahatma Gandhi’s salt march was about resisting economic injustice. Today, our battlegrounds are data privacy, unemployment and climate change. Draw parallels between past struggles and present-day challenges and question whether the courage of 1930 has truly travelled into the India of 2025 or if it is trapped in history textbooks.3. Patriotism vs Nationalism: Do We Know the Difference?High-schoolers often use these words interchangeably. Patriotism is love for your country; nationalism can become the demand for uncritical loyalty. A thoughtful speech can probe how blind nationalism risks silencing dissent and why a truly free India needs citizens who can question and improve it — not just cheer from the sidelines.4. Freedom to Dream, Freedom to FailWe celebrate billionaires and scientists but forget that the freedom to fail is also a marker of a free society. In school, failure can feel fatal; in life, it’s a stepping stone. Use your speech to connect academic pressures with the larger right to experiment, err, and evolve without stigma.5. India at 79: Still a Work in ProgressSeventy-eight years of independence have brought democracy, space missions, and economic growth — but also persistent inequality and corruption. Your audience is smart enough to handle nuance. Show them that loving your country means acknowledging its flaws, because blind adulation builds statues; honest critique builds nations.6. Youth as the Fourth Pillar of DemocracyShort Independence Day speech in English (Image: iStock)We’re told democracy rests on legislature, executive, and judiciary — but its future rests on young people who vote, volunteer, and hold power to account. Challenge your peers to see themselves as more than exam-takers; they are watchdogs, innovators, and future policymakers shaping India’s next 79 years.7. Unsung Heroes: Beyond the Textbook FiveMost school speeches name Gandhi, Nehru, Bhagat Singh, Bose, and Rani Laxmibai. But what about Matangini Hazra, Kanaklata Barua, or Peer Ali Khan? Bringing lesser-known freedom fighters into your speech honours their sacrifices and proves history is richer — and more inclusive — than the syllabus suggests.8. The Freedom to DisagreeIn 1947, the Constituent Assembly was a masterclass in debate and compromise. Today, social media turns disagreements into wars. Use this topic to argue why respecting different opinions is not weakness but the oxygen of democracy — and how students can practise that even in classroom discussions.9. Building the India We DeserveEvery Independence Day, leaders talk about the India of their dreams. But what about the India of your dreams? Paint a picture in your speech — cleaner streets, honest politics, fair opportunities — and remind your peers that the blueprint won’t come from Parliament alone. It starts in school corridors.10. Independence 2047: The Centenary QuestionWhen India turns 100 in 2047, most of today’s students will be in their 30s or 40s. What kind of country will we hand over to our children? Use your speech to make the centenary feel personal — not a far-off milestone, but a countdown that begins with the choices we make now.Remember, Independence Day speeches are more than ceremonial traditions — they are platforms to reignite the fire of patriotism and awaken a sense of responsibility in every Indian citizen. So, as you get ready for Independence Day 2025, pass on the legacy of our nation's heroes through your words because the future of India is shaped not only by its history but also by the way its youth carry the torch of freedom forward.Ready to navigate global policies?

Trump vs. Putin: Whose educational journey is more inspiring?
Vladimir Putin’s legal education at Leningrad State University, shaped by mentor Anatoly Sobchak and enriched by KGB service, contrasts with Donald Trump’s path from New York Military Academy discipline to Wharton’s business training.

Putin’s journey blends law, governance and statecraft; Trump’s emphasises economics, finance and entrepreneurship. Both leveraged education to reach political power, offering distinct models of leadership inspiration.  In global leadership, few figures have sparked as much discussion as Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. While their political paths have been debated extensively, their formative years in education reveal equally compelling stories of ambition, discipline and the foundation for their future careers. Both men took markedly different routes in their studies, shaped by distinct national systems, personal circumstances and career aspirations. Understanding their educational journeys offers insight into the early influences that guided their rise to the highest political offices in Russia and the United States.Vladimir Putin: Law, discipline and academic mentorship Vladimir Putin was born in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) on October 7, 1952. In 1975, he graduated with a degree in law from Leningrad State University, where he studied under Anatoly Sobchak, a reform-minded academic who would later play a key role in Russian politics during the perestroika era. Sobchak’s mentorship is widely regarded as instrumental in shaping Putin’s understanding of legal frameworks and governance.Putin’s education went beyond the classroom. Shortly after graduating, he was assigned to work in the KGB (Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti), the Soviet Union’s primary security and intelligence agency from 1954 to 1991. He eventually served 15 years as a foreign intelligence officer, including six in Dresden, East Germany. His career in intelligence required mastery of languages, international law and political strategy, effectively extending his education into real-world applications. In 1990, after retiring from active KGB service with the rank of lieutenant colonel, Putin returned to academia as assistant to the rector of Leningrad State University, responsible for international affairs. This role placed him back in an environment where policy and education intersected, reinforcing his network within Russia’s intellectual and political circles. His later career trajectory, from advising Sobchak, St. Petersburg’s first democratically elected mayor, to holding key national security roles, demonstrates how his legal education underpinned his approach to administration and leadership.Donald Trump: Business training and institutional discipline Donald Trump’s educational path began at the New York Military Academy, where he studied from 1959 to 1964. The military boarding school experience instilled a regimented discipline that would later be reflected in his assertive leadership style. Following this, Trump attended Fordham University in the Bronx from 1964 to 1966 before transferring to the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania. At Wharton, Trump completed a bachelor’s degree in economics in 1968. Wharton’s focus on quantitative analysis, finance and business strategy equipped him with skills he would directly apply in his family’s real estate business. Immediately after graduating, he joined the Trump Organisation, helping manage a substantial portfolio of rental housing units across New York City. His early exposure to large-scale property management and investment decisions cemented his reputation as a businessman well before he entered politics. Trump’s choice to transfer to Wharton reflected a deliberate effort to gain credentials from one of the most prestigious business schools in the United States. This decision marked a turning point in positioning himself for a career that blended business, branding and later political engagement.Two paths, one common outcome While Putin’s education was grounded in law, governance and statecraft, Trump’s was steeped in economics, finance and corporate strategy. Both trajectories reflect a commitment to acquiring the knowledge and credentials necessary to operate at high levels of influence. Putin’s years at Leningrad State University and subsequent academic role kept him closely tied to Russia’s evolving political landscape, blending legal expertise with geopolitical awareness. Trump’s academic progression from military discipline to Ivy League business training placed him at the intersection of structured leadership and market-driven decision-making.An educational lens on leadership inspiration Determining whose educational journey is “more inspiring” depends on what qualities one values. Putin’s path highlights the power of mentorship, public service and the integration of academic study with national duty. Trump’s journey underscores strategic decision-making in education, the value of prestigious credentials and the direct application of academic learning to entrepreneurial ventures. Both men leveraged their education to build careers that reached the pinnacle of political leadership in their respective countries. In that sense, their stories illustrate that while the fields of study may differ, law and governance in Putin’s case, business and finance in Trump’s, the commitment to learning and applying that knowledge remains a shared driver of their success.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

Rising US job cuts signal recession risk, with fresh entrants bearing the brunt: Does inexperience make you layoff-prone?
The July 2025 BLS report reveals significant job cuts across major industries like manufacturing, retail, and construction, mirroring pre-recession trends. Early-career professionals face heightened vulnerability due to inexperience and sector-specific downturns. Adaptability, strategic skill development, and sector awareness are crucial for navigating the evolving labor market and mitigating potential career disruptions.

Early-career professionals face heightened vulnerability due to inexperience and sector-specific downturns. Adaptability, strategic skill development, and sector awareness are crucial for navigating the evolving labor market and mitigating potential career disruptions.  The July 2025 US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Employment Situation report has exposed a stark warning for the nation’s labor market: more than half of major industries are now cutting jobs, signalling growing recession risks. For fresh graduates and early-career professionals, this is not just a statistic — it is a red flag for career planning. Manufacturing, retail, and construction, long-standing entry points for new workers, are shedding positions at alarming rates, while healthcare continues to add jobs but cannot offset the broader decline. Economists note that these patterns mirror trends seen before the 1981–82 recession and the Great Recession of 2007–09, where inexperienced workers were the first to bear the brunt. The pressing question emerges: does inexperience make you inherently layoff-prone in a cooling economy?Patterns and triggersThe sectors hardest hit, including manufacturing, retail, and construction, illustrate a broader economic principle: industries tied closely to consumer spending and capital investment feel downturns first. As per the US labour report, manufacturing shed 11,000 jobs in July, while retail layoffs soared 249% as compared to last year, and construction slowed as demand waned. Healthcare remains an outlier, still adding jobs, but insufficiently to offset losses elsewhere.Analysts, including Mark Zandi of Moody’s Analytics, interpret these numbers as classic early-warning signals: stagnant payroll growth, downward revisions of prior months’ data, and broad-based layoffs indicate the economy is losing momentum, as reported by the Economic Times.Key drivers of this trend include:Weakening consumer demand: Retail and construction are particularly vulnerable as households curb spending.Business caution: Companies are halting hiring and scaling back expansion plans amid uncertainty.Declining labor force participation: Some workers exit the labor market entirely, compounding overall employment declines.Why early-career workers are most exposedHistory shows that early-career professionals are disproportionately affected in downturns. The 1981–82 recession saw manufacturing and construction jobs collapse, with unemployment in some sectors reaching 24%. During the 2007–09 Great Recession, mid-wage, goods-producing, and entry-level jobs bore the brunt of cuts.The pattern is clear: inexperience and low seniority make workers more expendable when companies trim payrolls. Fresh graduates entering manufacturing, retail, or construction today face the same structural vulnerability.Economic and behavioural implicationsDespite 3% GDP growth in Q2 2025, layoffs threaten consumer spending, which drives nearly 70% of US economic activity. Reduced household income and confidence could trigger a downward spiral: layoffs reduce spending, which drives more layoffs.The Federal Reserve may cut interest rates to stimulate investment, but these interventions typically take months to influence the labor market. In the meantime, entry-level workers confront the immediate consequences of sectoral contraction.Strategic takeaways for new graduatesFor the Class of 2025 and other early-career entrants, survival requires a data-driven approach:Skill adaptability: Pair degrees with high-demand capabilities such as data analytics, AI tools, and digital project management.Sector awareness: Healthcare, AI-driven services, and green energy show relative resilience; manufacturing, retail, and construction are riskier.Network leverage: Alumni connections and referrals can mitigate reduced hiring pipelines.Global mobility: Hybrid or international roles can serve as a hedge against local economic fluctuations.Historical echoesThe current pattern mirrors prior recessions: layoffs start in consumer-linked sectors, early-career roles vanish first, and payroll stagnation precedes broader contraction. Historical evidence shows that early recognition of these trends and proactive skill adaptation can significantly reduce long-term career disruption.The bottom lineThe July 2025 layoffs are more than a short-term economic hiccup. They represent a structural warning for the Class of 2025 and early-career professionals: the first jobs are vanishing in sectors that have traditionally been entry points, and inexperience is amplifying vulnerability. Historical precedent, combined with current data, suggests that the job market is entering a phase where adaptability, cross-sector skills, and strategic planning will determine who navigates the next downturn successfullyReady to navigate global policies?

California’s statewide AI education push: Is it putting students’ academic integrity at risk?
California is launching a sweeping AI education program, partnering with tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Adobe to train millions of students. While aiming to boost career readiness, educators worry about academic integrity, AI overreliance, and corporate influence. With detection tools under scrutiny and teaching methods evolving, the balance between innovation and critical thinking remains unresolved.

While aiming to boost career readiness, educators worry about academic integrity, AI overreliance, and corporate influence. With detection tools under scrutiny and teaching methods evolving, the balance between innovation and critical thinking remains unresolved.  When Governor Gavin Newsom visited Google’s San Francisco office last Thursday, the focus was on the next wave set to reshape California’s classrooms. Against the backdrop of sweeping layoffs at Microsoft, Alphabet and Salesforce, he announced a series of agreements that would bring free artificial intelligence training to millions of students across the state. The deals, as reported by the Associated Press, bring together California’s community colleges, the California State University system, and K-12 districts with some of the largest names in technology including Google, Microsoft, Adobe and IBM. These partnerships will offer access to AI tools, exclusive versions of Google’s Gemini chatbot, and the company’s Notebook LLM research platform, alongside teacher training programs. In a job market where entry-level positions are disappearing under the weight of automation, this AI training is being framed as a lifeline for students to remain competitive. Yet, beneath the optimism, an undercurrent of concern runs through California’s classrooms.A balancing act between innovation and integrity Faculty groups, as AP notes, are questioning how these tools will coexist with the need to uphold academic standards. Stephanie Goldman, president of the Faculty Association of California Community Colleges, called the moment a “tough situation for faculty.” On one hand, AI literacy is increasingly non-negotiable for future careers. On the other, educators are grappling with how to ensure students develop critical thinking skills without leaning on AI as a shortcut. These concerns are not abstract. According to AP, California districts have already integrated AI in ways that tested the limits of trust. The Los Angeles Unified School District piloted an AI chatbot, only to cancel it within three months without explanation. San Diego Unified teachers experimented with AI-powered grading suggestions, with some board members reportedly unaware the software had been purchased. Meanwhile, the tools designed to guard academic integrity are themselves under scrutiny. Turnitin’s AI detection features, deployed by many K-12 and college districts, were found in a CalMatters investigation to sometimes flag legitimate work as AI-generated, a false positive that can be deeply damaging to a student’s record. Goldman points out that as AI capabilities are embedded directly into learning management systems like Canvas, districts face a paradox: Investing heavily in AI detection while adopting AI-enabled platforms for instruction.Scaling up with industry partners California’s community college system, which educates roughly 2.1 million students across 116 campuses, will lead much of the AI rollout. According to AP, it has already signed agreements with tech giants to integrate AI into both student learning and faculty development. Google’s Gemini and Notebook LLM will be accessible to students, while teachers will receive dedicated AI training modules. The Cal State University system is pursuing parallel agreements, expanding its AI programs with partners that include Amazon Web Services, Intel, LinkedIn and OpenAI. Even at the high school level, AI literacy initiatives are being shaped by corporate partnerships, with Adobe’s program aimed at helping students and teachers develop both the skills to use AI and the awareness to detect it. These moves, while ambitious, place California’s education systems at the forefront of AI adoption nationwide. Yet, they also grant tech companies unprecedented influence over what is taught and how it is delivered. As Justin Reich, an associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told AP, “We do not know what AI literacy is, how to use it, and how to teach with it. And we probably won’t for many years.”The pressure to act now For Erin Mote, CEO of the nonprofit InnovateEDU, hesitation carries its own risks. “There are a lot of rungs on the career ladder that are disappearing,” she told AP. “The biggest mistake we could make as educators is to wait and pause.” The pressure to prepare students for an AI-driven economy is undeniable. But the question remains whether this can be achieved without undermining the very qualities, such as independent thought, analytical reasoning, and originality, that education is meant to cultivate. AP notes that even earlier AI training efforts, such as the California Community Colleges’ partnership with NVIDIA, are still too new for meaningful results to be shared publicly.An open chapter in California’s classrooms As California’s AI education push accelerates, the balance between innovation and integrity is far from settled. The rollout is expansive, touching every level of the state’s education system, but the rules for responsible use are still being written. For now, faculty will have to navigate the tension between equipping students for the future and safeguarding the principles that define academic achievement. If this is the first draft of California’s AI-in-education story, it is being written with remarkable speed, and the final chapters are still wide open.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

Raised in an Army family, his early exposure to diverse environments fostered adaptability. He spearheaded IBM's strategic shift towards hybrid cloud and AI, highlighted by the pivotal acquisition of Red Hat, solidifying his legacy as an innovator and leader. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna When Arvind Krishna walked into his first electrical engineering lecture at IIT Kanpur in 1981, few could have guessed that the young student from an Army family in India would one day take charge of one of the most storied technology companies in the world. Today, as chairman and CEO of IBM, Krishna leads a global workforce, drives innovation in artificial intelligence and hybrid cloud, and steers the company’s vision for quantum computing. His journey spanning Indian classrooms, American research labs, and corporate boardrooms is a powerful reminder of how education and determination can transform a career.From Army family to global classroomBorn on November 23, 1962, in Andhra Pradesh’s West Godavari district, Arvind Krishna was raised in a family where service and discipline were woven into daily life. His father, Major General Vinod Krishna, served in the Indian Army, while his mother, Aarathi Krishna, devoted her time to the welfare of Army widows. Moving frequently during his childhood exposed him to diverse learning environments, including Stanes Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School in Coonoor and St Joseph’s Academy in Dehradun. This early exposure to varied cultures and academic settings helped develop the adaptability that would later serve him in the fast-changing world of technology.Engineering excellence at IIT Kanpur and UIUCIn 1981, Krishna joined the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur to study electrical engineering. The rigorous academic environment honed his analytical thinking and problem-solving skills, and in 1985 he graduated with a BTech in Electrical Engineering. Eager to deepen his expertise, he moved to the United States and enrolled at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where he pursued advanced research in computer networks and systems. In 1991, he earned his PhD in Electrical Engineering, a qualification that would anchor his credibility as both a technologist and a leader.Three decades of innovation at IBMKrishna joined IBM’s Thomas J. Watson Research Center in 1990, starting in research roles that allowed him to combine technical depth with creative problem-solving. Over the next 18 years, he contributed to breakthroughs in databases, systems, and networking. Moving into executive roles, he led IBM’s Information Management Software and Systems & Technology Group before being promoted in 2015 to Senior Vice President of IBM Research. Later, as head of IBM’s Cloud and Cognitive Software division, he expanded the company’s presence in AI, blockchain, hybrid cloud, and quantum computing. His most notable strategic achievement came in 2019, when he was the driving force behind IBM’s $34 billion acquisition of Red Hat — the largest in the company’s history.From researcher to CEOIn January 2020, IBM named Arvind Krishna as the successor to Ginni Rometty, and on April 6, 2020, he officially took over as CEO. Just a year later, he was appointed Chairman of IBM’s Board. Under his leadership, IBM has sharpened its focus on hybrid cloud platforms, AI-driven solutions, and advanced computing technologies to stay ahead in an intensely competitive industry. Despite his corporate responsibilities, Krishna remains connected to his roots as a researcher, holding 15 patents, editing IEEE and ACM journals, and publishing extensively in technical literature.Ready to navigate global policies?

Harvard nears $500 million settlement with Trump administration: How the funding deal could impact students
Harvard University is nearing a $500 million settlement with the Trump administration, potentially restoring $2.6 billion in lost federal funding and ending a high-profile dispute over academic freedom. The deal could revive research grants, scholarships, and international programs but may impose new conditions affecting governance, curriculum, and free speech, with nationwide implications for university autonomy.

The deal could revive research grants, scholarships, and international programs but may impose new conditions affecting governance, curriculum, and free speech, with nationwide implications for university autonomy.  Harvard University is moving closer to a $500 million settlement with the Trump administration, a deal that could restore federal funding and conclude months of political and legal confrontation. The Associated Press reports that both parties have agreed on the payment amount, though negotiations over the broader framework remain underway. A final agreement could be reached in the coming weeks. The proposed deal would end a prolonged dispute that has tested the limits of the federal government’s authority over academic institutions. The conflict began with an investigation into campus antisemitism and escalated sharply after the administration cut more than $2.6 billion in research grants, ended federal contracts, and attempted to block Harvard from hosting international students. Harvard responded with lawsuits accusing the administration of unlawful retaliation, asserting that the federal demands posed a threat to academic freedom. If approved, the $500 million payment would mark the largest such settlement reached by the Trump administration with a higher education institution. Comparable deals have included a $200 million payment from Columbia University and a $50 million payment from Brown University to local workforce development organisations. It remains unclear how Harvard’s payment would be allocated.Potential impact on students For students, the settlement could determine the pace and scope of restored academic opportunities. Federal research funding plays a central role in supporting laboratories, scholarships, and faculty-led projects across disciplines. Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, whose positions are often tied to federal grants, have faced uncertainty since the funding cuts took effect. Undergraduate students have also seen disruptions to federally funded internships and international exchange programs. The reinstatement of federal access could stabilise Harvard’s capacity to host international students, an integral component of its academic diversity. The Department of Homeland Security’s earlier attempt to block such enrollments had created significant disruptions, even though a federal court later overturned the move.Broader academic concerns The settlement talks are being watched closely by lawmakers, faculty, and higher education advocates. According to the Associated Press, more than a dozen Democratic members of Congress who are Harvard alumni warned on August 1 that any agreement could warrant “rigorous Congressional oversight and inquiry.” They cautioned that yielding to political demands could set a precedent that threatens the autonomy of universities nationwide. The Trump administration has framed its actions as part of a broader effort to reform elite academic institutions, which the president has criticised as aligned with liberal ideologies. Harvard, with its $53 billion endowment, has been the most frequent target of these interventions.Looking ahead While the settlement could bring immediate financial relief and restore program stability, it may also carry new conditions that influence campus governance, curriculum oversight, or student speech. The Associated Press notes that similar agreements with other universities have included provisions that sparked debates over academic freedom. For now, Harvard students await clarity on how quickly programs might be reinstated and whether the funding restoration will come without limitations on the university’s independence. The final terms, still under negotiation, will shape both the university’s financial future and the student experience for years to come.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

However, it faces stiff competition from Rajinikanth's Coolie, which has earned ₹20.84 crore in the same period.  'War 2' has finally released in theatres and the film has got mixed reviews by the audience so far but it is off to a great start. The film is facing a huge competition from Rajinikanth's 'Coolie' which has also released today and this is one of the biggest clashes of movies. 'War 2' starring Hrithik Roshan, Jr NTR and Kiara Advani has released in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. While the pre-release ticket sales was not as high, just as the Telugu markets opened, the numbers from the advance bookings grew due to Jr NTR's presence as he's a huge star there. Thus, the film may be expected to do well in Telugu and Hindi both. It had collected Rs 16 crore gross already from the advance bookings. Hrithik calls Rajinikanth his 'first teacher' ahead of 'War 2' vs 'Coolie' clashAs of now, as far as the net collections are concerned. Till afternoon, 'War 2', has started off on a great note. As the collection so far is Rs 13.91 crore, according to Sacnilk. The film should have a day 1 number of atleast Rs 30-40 crore but time will tell if the numbers increase or decrease with spot bookings which will largely depend on positive word of mouth towards the film. Meanwhile, 'Coolie' starring Rajikinanth, Nagarjuna Akkineni, Aamir Khan, Shruti Haasan has made Rs 23.38 crore up till the same time. According to Box Office India, Trade analysts caution, that these numbers of 'War 2' don’t yet point to an “huge blockbuster type of weekend”, the kind the industry hopes for with such big-budget spectacles.'War 2' may look underwhelming when compared to some past juggernauts, but the ratio of advance sales to first-day collections has changed in recent years, making direct parallels tricky. Some previous “big ones,” as the trade hints, even had “advances which were tampered putting it in a nice way.” By contrast, War 2’s advance numbers are twice that of recent big titles like 'Raid 2' and 'Housefull 5'. Eventually, it's the reviews and now the footfalls during the weekend which will eventually determine the film's fate. But at the moment it looks like, 'Coolie' is definitely on the upper side in terms of the numbers.

Actor Varun Badola, who was recently seen in the blockbuster 'Saiyaara', has weighed in on the film’s runaway success and the performances of its debutant leads, Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda. Despite chatter that the film signals the end of the “star era,” Varun isn’t convinced.Directed by Mohit Suri, the romantic drama has stormed past the ₹500 crore mark worldwide, placing it among the highest-grossing Hindi films ever. The film’s rise has drawn comparisons to 'Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak', 'Maine Pyaar Kiya', and 'Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai' that launched Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, and Hrithik Roshan, respectively.Speaking to Nayandeep Rakshit, Varun addressed the claim that Saiyaara’s success proves films don’t need big stars anymore. “People are saying that this film has proven that we don’t need stars anymore. That’s not true. Abhi tum Ahaan Panday ko utha ke Jawan mein daalo, Jawan flop ho jayegi. Shah Rukh ko Saiyaara mein daal do, Saiyaara flop ho jayegi. Shah Rukh will suddenly become too big for the film, and Ahaan will not have the personality to run Jawan.”While he refrained from making predictions about Ahaan’s future, Varun noted that the actor’s career would depend heavily on his upcoming choices. Produced by Aditya Chopra, Saiyaara became Ahaan’s debut vehicle after another project he was attached to was shelved. Varun praised Ahaan’s screen presence and expressed admiration for Aneet’s command over Hindi. He also remarked on the film’s father-son dynamic: “very ‘Bhatt camp’,” he said, adding that it made sense since Mohit Suri began his career under Mahesh Bhatt.Interestingly, this isn’t the first time Varun has spoken bluntly about the film. In an earlier interview with SCREEN, he questioned the authenticity of some of the fanfare. “I saw the euphoria on Instagram. Log jo chudiyaan tod rahe hai, chaatiyaan peet rahe hai. I think the promotions team went a little overboard there, where people are going to see the film, putting IV drips. Those people must have been told to give content in some way; thank god, people didn’t get their legs broken and went crawling to see the film,” he said."Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

It becomes the highest-grossing Indian animated film. The film earns Rs 138.75 crore in India within 20 days. It surpasses several Bollywood blockbusters. Positive word of mouth and strong visuals fuel its success. The film's performance paves the way for future installments. It proves the potential of Indian animation.  In a historic milestone for Indian animation,Ashwin Kumar’s Mahavatar Narsimha has officially entered the list of the Top 80 highest-grossing Hindi films of all time, overtaking some of Bollywood’s most successful live-action blockbusters. The Ashwin Kumar directorial, the first installment in the ambitious seven-part Mahavatar Cinematic Universe, has grossed Rs 138.75 crore in India in just 20 days, edging past Varun Dhawan’s Judwaa 2 (Rs 138.55 crore), Ayushmann Khurrana’s Badhaai Ho (Rs 137.31 crore), and Akshay Kumar’s Toilet: Ek Prem Katha (Rs 134.42 crore).What makes this achievement even more remarkable is that Mahavatar Narsimha is an Indian animated film, while animation as a genre has found success but Indian animation has been on par with its international counterparts.  Not only has Mahavatar Narsimha broken that long-standing barrier, it is now the highest-grossing Indian animated film ever, setting a benchmark that future productions in the space will aspire to match.PollDo you think Mahavatar Narsimha's success will inspire more animated films in India?YesNoThe film’s box office journey has been nothing short of extraordinary. Opening with a modest Rs 1.35 crore on Day 1, Mahavatar Narsimha picked up pace quickly, fueled by positive word of mouth, stunning visuals, and a storyline deeply rooted in Indian mythology. The first major boost came over the weekend, with collections like Rs 3.25 crore (Day 2), Rs 6.8crore (Day 3), with week 1 collection in Hindi ending at Rs 32.45 crore. The film in week 2 saw a bigger jump than week 1 where it minted Rs 54.95 crore from it’s Hindi version.The combination of high-quality animation, compelling voice performances, and deep rooted emotions that blended epic orchestration with devotional undertones created a cinematic experience that appealed across age groups.The film’s success also lays the groundwork for the upcoming installments of the Mahavatar Cinematic Universe, a planned seven-part animated epic chronicling the avatars of Lord Vishnu.For now, Mahavatar Narsimha has not just made history for animation in India it has proved that strong storytelling, rooted in culture but presented with modern technology, can rival and even surpass mainstream Bollywood entertainers.Also the film was expected to experience a drop in it’s collection thanks to the release of Rajinikanth’s Coolie and Hrithik Roshan-Jr NTR’s War 2 taking up most of the screens but muted response to War 2 can make space for Mahavtar Narsimha thus giving a major push to its collection of Rs 185.50 across multiple languages .

'Baby Shark' plagiarism case: Pinkfong scores victory
South Korea's Supreme Court ruled that Pinkfong's 'Baby Shark' did not plagiarize Jonathan Robert Wright's version. Wright alleged copyright infringement, demanding damages. The court stated both versions are rearrangements of a traditional song lacking a single copyright owner. Pinkfong's 2016 English version became a global sensation, surpassing 10 billion views on YouTube, affirming its adaptation as a creative work.

Wright alleged copyright infringement, demanding damages. The court stated both versions are rearrangements of a traditional song lacking a single copyright owner. Pinkfong's 2016 English version became a global sensation, surpassing 10 billion views on YouTube, affirming its adaptation as a creative work. 'Baby Shark', the #1 streaming video worldwide After a six-year battle, the South Korea's Supreme Court has ruled that Pinkfong's hit children's song 'Baby Shark', is not a case of plagiarism. The dispute began when American composer Jonathan Robert Wright alleged that Pinkfong's 2015 Korean version, and the latter 2016 English version, were copied from his 2011 arrangement of the folk tune. He demanded damages of about ₩3 million. But, according to the court's ruling, both his work and Pinkfong's are rearrangements of a traditional song with no single copyright owner.Reason Behind The Verdict According to the judgment reported by Yonhap News, Wright's version lacked enough originality to be considered a secondary copyrighted work. The Korean Copyright Commission's evaluation, cited by the court, found that his 2011 song added only instruments like electric guitar and synthesizers to a melody already sung for generations in camps and classrooms. Under Korean law, familiarity and widespread oral tradition outweighed his claim to exclusive ownership.Song's Record-Breaking 10 billion views Pinkfong (then SmartStudy) gave 'Baby Shark' its now-iconic "Ah~ gi shark, doo roo doo roo" hook and bouncy animation in 2015, followed by a bubbly English version in 2016. That version went from a local children's song to world's most-viewed YouTube video in November 2020, and in January 2022, it became the first video ever to surpass 10 billion views (YouTube public data).A win for creativity The Supreme Court's verdict, grounded in legal reasoning but resonating with playgrounds worldwide, protects Pinkfong's adaptations while affirming that some songs are part of humanity's collective memory."Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorKorean DeskKorean Desk covers news and stories from South Korea’s entertainment scene.

Soon after Bollywood actor Shilpa Shetty Kundra and her businessman husband Raj Kundra were booked in connection with the Rs 60.4 crore cheating case, their advocate, Prashant Patil, on Thursday issued a statement to IANS, calling the allegations "baseless" and said it is aimed at maligning the reputation of his clients. Advocate Releases StatementResponding to media reports, Advocate Prashant Patil released a statement that read, "My clients have been informed by certain segments of electronic and print media that an alleged case has been registered against them at the Economic Offences Wing, Mumbai. At the outset, my clients deny all the allegations, which are purely civil in nature and have already been adjudicated by the NCLT Mumbai on 04/10/2024."Calling it an old business transaction that turned into a legal matter after financial distress, Patil added: "There is no criminality involved. Our auditors have submitted all necessary supporting documents from time to time, as requested by the EOW, including detailed cash flow statements."He further clarified that the investment agreement in question was like an equity investment, and the company had already received a liquidation order, which was also presented to the Police Department."The concerned chartered accountants have visited the police station more than 15 times over the past year, with all evidence supporting our clients' claims. This is nothing but a baseless and malicious case aimed at maligning our clients, and appropriate legal action is being initiated from our side against the perpetrators," Patil stated.About The CaseThe fraud case has been linked to a now-defunct company Best Deal TV Pvt Ltd, which involves a complaint by Mumbai-based businessman Deepak Kothari, who has accused the couple of defrauding him of over Rs 60 crore in a loan-cum-investment deal between 2015 and 2023. According to police sources, complainant Deepak Kothari, director of Lotus Capital Financial Services, alleged that the funds, meant for business expansion, were diverted for personal use.He said that Rajesh Arya had introduced him to the celebrity couple, who at the time were the directors of Best Deal TV Pvt Ltd, a home shopping and online retail company in which the couple reportedly held a combined 87.6 per cent stake.Complaint FiledInitially, the complaint was filed at Juhu Police Station under sections related to cheating and forgery. However, given the financial scale of the case, exceeding Rs 10 crore, the investigation was transferred to the EOW following a preliminary inquiry.Kothari claimed that the accused initially sought a loan of Rs 75 crore at 12 per cent interest but later urged him to structure it as an investment to avoid higher tax liability. In return, they allegedly promised monthly returns along with repayment of the principal amount.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

‘Coolie’ to challenge ‘Pushpa 2’ in North America
Rajinikanth's 'Coolie' has premiered in North America with a record-breaking USD 2.9 million, becoming the biggest Tamil film premiere ever in the region. It is now challenging 'Pushpa 2' for the highest premiere day collections for an Indian film. Despite competition from 'War 2', 'Coolie's' success is driven by Rajinikanth's popularity and a star-studded cast.

It is now challenging 'Pushpa 2' for the highest premiere day collections for an Indian film. Despite competition from 'War 2', 'Coolie's' success is driven by Rajinikanth's popularity and a star-studded cast. Rajinikanth's 'Coolie' has premiered in North America with a record-breaking USD 2.9 million, becoming the biggest Tamil film premiere ever in the region. It is now challenging 'Pushpa 2' for the highest premiere day collections for an Indian film. Despite competition from 'War 2', 'Coolie's' success is driven by Rajinikanth's popularity and a star-studded cast. Rajinikanth’s latest film Coolie is off to a flying start in North America, with premiere show earnings touching an impressive USD 2.9 million as per distributor Prathyangira Cinemas. The figure instantly made Coolie the biggest Tamil film premiere in North American history and placed it 9th among the highest-grossing Tamil films of all time in the region, an extraordinary feat considering these numbers come from just premiere shows. What’s more,Coolie could go one step further and challenge Allu Arjun’s Pushpa 2 for the record of biggest premiere day collections in North America for an Indian film. Pushpa 2, which released last year had a record-breaking collection of USD 3.34 million from its premiere shows, setting a high bar for every major release since.Pushpa 2 went on to mint over USD 15.26 million by the end of its theatrical run while it’s breakeven number was USD 15 million leaving the distributors with very little profit. Coolie on the other hand will need to cross USD 7.5 million to break even, now the profit of the film is dependent on the upcoming weekend and the strong word of mouth. Given the pace at which Coolie is selling tickets, trade experts say it’s “easily primed” to surpass that figure. The combination of Rajinikanth’s pan-Indian appeal and Lokesh Kanagaraj’s mass entertainer brand has created intense buzz, translating into strong advance sales across Tamil and Telugu speaking diaspora audiences in the United States and Canada.However, the film’s ultimate tally will depend heavily on show count availability, a factor complicated by its high-profile clash with Aditya Chopra’s War 2 starring Hrithik Roshan, Jr NTR, and Kiara Advani, the action spectacle has also released this weekend, commanding premium screens and a significant share of IMAX and PLF (Premium Large Format) slots. This direct competition means Coolie may have fewer screenings than it would in an open weekend, potentially capping its ceiling despite huge demand.Even with the clash, Coolie’s USD 2.9 million start is nothing short of phenomenal. To put it in perspective, Rajinikanth’s 2019 blockbuster Petta earned USD 2.55 million in its entire North American run, while his recent hit Vettaiyan finished at USD 2.83 million and Kamal Haasan’s Vikram earned USD 2.84 million, Coolie has essentially matched or surpassed all of them in just its first few hours.The movie’s performance is also a testament to its wide appeal, powered by a star-studded ensemble featuring Nagarjuna, Soubin Shahir, Shruti Haasan, Sathyaraj, Upendra, and even Aamir Khan in a key role. The casting has given Coolie significant traction across South Indian diaspora markets while also drawing attention in Bollywood-leaning territories.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Javed Akhtar: Initially there was no Sambha in 'Sholay'
Javed Akhtar reflects on the making of 'Sholay,' revealing initial character concepts like Thakur as an army officer and Jai-Veeru as undisciplined recruits. He discusses the accidental creation of Samba and emphasizes Gabbar's asexuality as a key element of his powerful villain persona. Akhtar also shares insights into the film's initial poor reception and Salim-Javed's unwavering confidence in its success.

He discusses the accidental creation of Samba and emphasizes Gabbar's asexuality as a key element of his powerful villain persona. Akhtar also shares insights into the film's initial poor reception and Salim-Javed's unwavering confidence in its success.  As 'Sholay' turns 50 tomorrow (August 15th), its legacy remains as unshakable as the rocky cliffs of Ramgarh. Few films in Indian cinema have transcended generations the way Ramesh Sippy’s magnum opus has — its dialogues, characters, and even silences etched into popular culture. But behind the spectacle lies a creation born from instinct, conviction, and an unflinching belief in its own storytelling. In this candid conversation with ETimes, Javed Akhtar — one half of the legendary Salim-Javed duo — revisits the genesis of the film, reveals the lesser-known transformations of its characters, and shares why neither he nor Salim ever doubted Sholay, even when the world thought it had failed.Javed Saab, you must be so fed up of talking about 'Sholay'?I’ve said it all over and over again. Obviously, I can’t change the narrative just to make it interesting every time. Jo tha, woh tha. That’s it.The making of Thakur’s characterLet’s begin with the character of Thakur.To begin with, Thakur was not a Thakur at all, but a retired army officer who had lost his hands in action. Jai and Veeru were initially two undisciplined recruits thrown out of the army. He chased them and asked for their help.But then Salim and I thought that if you portray army characters, you must maintain a certain dignity and discipline, and there would be restrictions. Showing undisciplined recruits was also not a good idea. So, we made Thakur a police officer and turned Jai and Veeru into petty criminals. That’s how it started.So originally, Sanjeev Kumar’s character had lost his hands as an army officer?Yes. A hand grenade exploded. But that idea was dropped, and we brought the character into the police force. Jai and Veeru became petty criminals who, despite being in police custody, once saved Thakur’s life. He was the man who had arrested them, but this act formed a good impression, and he later called them for help.How other characters came inWhen we began developing the screenplay, other characters entered — Basanti, Radha, Imam Sahab, Ramlal (played by Satyen Kappu, who worked for Thakur), and many others. Interestingly, at the screenplay stage, there was no Samba.The birth of SambaReally? How did Samba happen?When I was writing Gabbar’s introduction scene, Samba was born. Important people often have sycophants who talk about their achievements. Gabbar had to boast about the ₹50,000 reward for his arrest — a huge sum back then — but he wouldn’t say it himself; it was beneath his dignity. So, we gave him a yes-man.Once we did that, we realised it was a good gimmick. The idea was that whenever Gabbar was in thought, he would call Samba and ask something. But Samba actually answers only once — about the ₹50,000 reward. Later, when Gabbar asks, “Ramgarh ke log apni ladkiyon ko kaun se chakki ka aata khilate hain?” Samba has no reply. In the entire film, Samba speaks just one line.On Gabbar’s asexualityGabbar is terrifying, but also completely asexual. Even when he ties up the girl, he sneers but never leers. Gabbar, Mogambo, or even Shakal from Shaan — they are all totally asexual. They are never interested in women. If a powerful villain starts lusting after a woman, he looks like a beggar.How a beggar?It’s below a powerful villain’s dignity to go after anything. Lust is not power; it makes you look like a lecher, and lechery isn’t dignified.In Shaan, Shakal kidnaps Raakhee Gulzar’s character and tells her she’ll be held until her husband comes to save her. She’s tense, thinking he might keep her for the night. He smiles and says, “Don’t flatter yourself. I am not interested in you at all. You don’t attract me.”Why Shakal didn’t work like GabbarWhy do you think Shakal didn’t click like Gabbar? Was he too urban? Too James Bond?No, it wasn’t Shakal. It was the film that didn’t work. It wasn’t made from the heart. There was an anxiety to perform — performance anxiety — and that killed it. Otherwise, the characters and performances were very good.RD Burman’s music — Shaan vs SholayIn my opinion, RD Burman’s music was better in Shaan than in Sholay, except for the background score.I don’t think Sholay’s songs were very good. 'Mehbooba O Mehbooba' and 'Yeh Dosti' were hits, but they were situational. In fact, the EPs and LPs of the dialogues sold much more than the songs. The first EP was titled Viru Ki Shaadi. The verbal sold far more than the musical.RD really excelled in the background music, not the songs. Maybe when he saw the complete film, he realised the songs were comparatively weaker, so he compensated in the background score — and he did that with vengeance.When 'Sholay' opened poorlyWhen the film released, the team was anxious because it wasn’t doing well. You even planned to change the ending?Not us. Not Salim-Javed. Not for a second did we think the film would go wrong. Others got nervous, but our confidence never wavered. In the first week itself, on Friday, we gave an ad in Screen, Film Information and Trade Guide that Salim-Javed guarantee Sholay will do more than ₹1 crore. We put our money where our mouth was — when the industry was convinced it had failed.The team had an emergency meeting at Amitabh Bachchan’s home?No. He was neither that important nor powerful then for us to go to his house for such a meeting. It happened at my place. Bachchan Saab, GP Sippy, and Ramesh Sippy came over, and the five of us discussed the situation. We told them, “Don’t worry. Nothing will happen to you.” Not for a second did we think the picture could fail. We gave ads, and the rest is history.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

He had been battling a prolonged illness and undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Bengaluru. Despite financial assistance from friends and colleagues, his health deteriorated, leading to his passing. (Picture Courtesy: Facebook) The Kannada film fraternity is mourning the loss of director Murali Mohan, a filmmaker who left a lasting imprint on the industry through his collaborations with some of its biggest stars.Best known for helming 'Nagarahavu' with Real Star Upendra, Santha with Hat-trick Hero Shivarajkumar, and Mallikarjuna with Crazy Star Ravichandran, Murali Mohan passed away in Bengaluru on August 13. He was 57. His death comes after a long and difficult battle with kidney-related ailments.The news was shared by the director Prakasharaj Mehu via social media. Taking to Facebook handle he wrote, "Murali Mohan was one of the driving forces behind the film Om! The reason I say this is because, during the story discussions at Vajreshwari Productions that I was part of, every time the topic of Om came up, Varadanna would fondly remember Murali and the contribution he made to that film!! He praised Murali’s intelligence. It is a tragedy that his true talent was never fully utilised in the Kannada film industry!!!"Prakasharaj Mehu further wrote, "Seeing people like him makes one believe the saying that nothing else grows under a big banyan tree. Murali, who always spoke about God, religion, meditation, homa, and havan, appeared to me more like the head of a monastery than a film director. He had bought a plot in Uttarahalli, but it got caught up with the Rajakaluve (stormwater drain). He struggled a lot to save it. Today, he has become free from all such concerns. Salutations to you, Murali — may the heaven you believed in be yours…” — Prakash Raj Mehu, Writer and Film Director."A long fight against illnessFor years, Murali Mohan had been undergoing treatment at a private hospital on JC Road in Bengaluru. His condition had required costly surgeries. Reportedly, he had publicly appealed for financial help when medical expenses mounted to an estimated Rs 30–35 lakh. Friends, colleagues, and well-wishers rallied to his side, raising funds and offering support. Despite their efforts, his health continued to decline, and he breathed his last on Wednesday.Friendship with UpendraMurali Mohan’s had a long standing bond with the superstar Upendra. That bond evolved into a creative partnership on several projects, including cult hits like 'Om', 'Shhh', and 'Tarle Nan Maga', where he contributed behind the scenes.About the AuthorEntertainment Deskमटा मनोरंजन डेस्क ही मराठी आणि हिंदी चित्रपट, ओटीटी, संगीत, मराठी टीव्ही कार्यक्रम, वेब सिरीज आणि सेलिब्रिटी बातम्यांवर केंद्रित एक उत्साही टीम आहे. चित्रपट समीक्षण, कलाकारांच्या मुलाखती, ट्रेलर विश्लेषण, गॉसिप्स आणि सोशल मीडिया ट्रेंड्सवरील विश्वासार्ह आणि मनोरंजक माहिती आम्ही सर्जनशील शैलीत वाचकांपर्यंत पोहोचवितो. माहिती आणि मनोरंजन यांचा समतोल राखणे हे आमचे वैशिष्ट्य आहे.Read MoreEnd of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Why is the Peepal tree worshipped in India5 early symptoms of Diabetes in men that should not be ignoredCardiologist says these blood tests that can predict heart disease risks even before symptoms appearTemples, Taj, and Thar: An epic 15-day adventure in the heart of North IndiaThis is how cooking meat may increase the risk of cancerFrom bullied schoolboy to ₹3,000 crore superstar – Hrithik Roshan’s inspiring journeyHow to see incredible India in just two weeksSeeds that supercharge muscle growth and overall healthFrom Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leavesTop 5 Getaways in North and South India to Work Remotely123Top TrendingTyreek HillVanessa BryantDwyane WadeKyrie lrvingNHL Trade RumorsShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteMaharashtra NEET UG counselling 2025 round 1 seat allotment list out: Check direct link to download hereSBI Clerk waitlist 2025 out for Junior Associates at sbi.co.in: Check direct link to download PDF list hereRussell Wilson's wife Ciara becomes first descendants of enslaved Africans to receive Benin citizenship under historic new lawNBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Eye Potential Austin Reaves Trade for $36.37 Million Sacramento Kings Star Duo;

Rajinikanth's 'Coolie,' directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj, has shattered North American box office records, earning an estimated USD 2.9 million on its premiere day. This impressive opening has already propelled 'Coolie' to become the 9th biggest Tamil grosser ever in North America, surpassing Kamal Haasan’s 'Vikram' and two other Rajinikanth films. Superstar Rajinikanth has once again proved his box office dominance, this time in spectacular fashion with the release of Coolie. Directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj, the much-anticipated action drama has shattered records on its very first day in North America, earning an estimated USD 2.9 million from its premiere day shows alone as per distributor Prathyangira Cinemas.What makes this number remarkable is not just the sheer scale of the opening but the fact that Coolie has already become the 9th biggest Tamil grosser ever in North America beating Kamal Haasan’s Vikram( ( USD 2.84 million) coincidentally also directed by Lokesh Kanagraj . With these numbers Rajinikanth was not only able to dethrone Vikram but also went passed his other two films Vettiyan ( USD 2.83 million ) and Petta ( USD 2.51 million) While, Vikram, Petta and Vettaiyan achieved their totals over several weeks of play, Coolie has managed to match or surpass those numbers within hours. The performance r underlines the unprecedented pre-release buzz around the film, driven by the high-profile pairing of Rajinikanth and Lokesh Kanagaraj. The latter is one of Tamil cinema’s most sought-after directors, and his collaboration with the Superstar for the first time had already generated a level of anticipation that translated directly into massive advance bookings.Given that Coolie’s opening day is not yet over, the film is well on track to break into the top 10 biggest Tamil films in North America before the day concludes. In fact, early forecasts suggest that by the time full day-one figures are tallied, Coolie could land in the 8th position on the all-time list.This kind of start all but guarantees that Coolie will be a dominant force in the coming days. If the positive audience reception matches the hype and early social media chatter indicates it does the film could aim for an even higher rank, possibly challenging the top five Tamil grossers in the market.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Six years later, Coolie is primed to chase down that milestone, riding on unprecedented audience excitement and a star-studded ensemble.Massive advance bookingsAccording to early data, Coolie has clocked an advance booking gross of Rs 37.2 crore from 1.73 million tickets sold across India without counting block seats. Factoring in those blocked seats, the figure jumps to a staggering Rs 46.36 crore, putting the film well within striking distance of 2.0’s opening day total even before the first show has rolled out.Breaking down the numbers, the Tamil version leads the charge with Rs 27.92 crore from over 1.29 million tickets, spread across 7,235 shows with the rest coming in from Telugu, Hindi and Kannada versions. The combined show count for all languages stands at 13,083, a testament to the scale at which Coolie is rolling out nationwide.The buzz around Coolie has been fuelled by the blockbuster combination of Rajinikanth and Lokesh Kanagaraj, one of Tamil cinema’s most successful contemporary directors. Known for creating high-energy, mass-entertainer spectacles, Lokesh has previously delivered back-to-back blockbusters, and his collaboration with the Superstar marks a dream pairing for fans.The cast only adds to the film’s appeal, with prominent names such as Nagarjuna, Soubin Shahir, Shruti Haasan, Sathyaraj, Upendra, and even Bollywood superstar Aamir Khan in a pivotal role. By 10 AM the film has already minted Rs 14.25 crore. Trade analysts point out that with such a high advance booking figure and the expected surge in spot bookings Coolie could potentially breach the RS 60 crore mark on day one, making it the biggest opener in Rajinikanth’s career and one of the top openings in Indian cinema history.With just advance booking numbers Coolie sits on 3rd spot and Jailer being on 2nd spot with Rs 48 crore collection. Even if Coolie fails to beat 2.0’s numbers as it has less shows thanks to clash with War 2 starring Hrithik Roshan, Jr NTR and Kiara Advani, it will become Rajinikanth’s second biggest day 1 opener. But if it happens, it would mean Rajinikanth surpassing Rajinikanth, dethroning his own 2.0 record after six years. All eyes are now on the first-day actuals. If early trends are any indication, Coolie won’t just be a commercial win, it could be a career-defining moment in Rajinikanth’s already illustrious journey.

The couple, along with an unidentified individual, are accused of misappropriating funds from Deepak Kothari, intended for their now-defunct company, Best Deal TV Pvt Ltd, between 2015 and 2023.  Bollywood actor Shilpa Shetty Kundra and her husband and businessman Raj Kundra, along with an unidentified individual, have been booked by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police for allegedly defrauding a city-based businessman. Police ReportAccording to the police report, the three were involved in a loan-cum-investment deal linked of Rs 60.4 crore to their now-defunct company Best Deal TV Pvt Ltd. Businessman Deepak Kothari has alleged that the couple 'misappropriated funds' he provided between 2015 and 2023 for business expansion. He also alleges that they diverted the funds for personal use. The case was initially registered at Juhu Police Station under sections related to cheating and forgery. However, it was later transferred to the EOW after it was determined that the amount involved exceeded Rs 10 crore.Complaint RegisteredThe complaint, according to ANI, alleges that the accused initially sought a Rs 75 crore loan at 12% interest but later persuaded him to provide the funds as an “investment” to reduce tax liabilities. He was reportedly assured monthly returns along with repayment of the principal.The AllegationsKothari, a Juhu resident, stated in his complaint that he was introduced to Shetty and Kundra by one Rajesh Arya.

Despite offering a personal guarantee in April 2016, Shetty resigned as director in September that year, the FIR notes. Kothari later discovered that the company had entered bankruptcy proceedings in 2017 after defaulting on another agreement.Police confirmed that an investigation is underway and that further details will be shared as the case progresses.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Ayan Mukerji's directorial venture is receiving mixed reviews, with praise for action but criticism for its storyline. Rajinikanth’s 'Coolie' leads with ₹11.63 crore.  'War 2' has finally hit theatres, and early estimates suggest a promising start for the Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR-led action thriller. Early Box Office EstimatesThe film that is reportedly tracking an estimated Rs 30 crore opening, set the cash registers ringing this Thursday morning, by recording a good start at the box office. According to industry tracker Sacnilk, the film has raked in approximately Rs 6.16 crore India net across all languages so far.'War 2' kicked off with strong morning show occupancies, managing to cross the Rs 5 crore mark with just early ticket sales and first shows. The numbers are expected to see a significant jump during the high-traffic evening and night shows, which traditionally contribute the bulk of first-day collections.Directed by Ayan Mukerji, the film has been generating mixed reactions from audiences. While many have praised the high-octane action sequences, grand scale, and the on-screen presence of Hrithik and Jr NTR, others have criticised its template storyline and uneven pacing. Social media reviews ranged from “Fun & paisa vasool” to labelling it “strictly MID” and “a recycled, same-old template.”Coolie's Impressive CollectionsHowever, the box office battle this Independence Day weekend is far from one-sided. Sharing the release date with 'War 2' is superstar Rajinikanth’s highly anticipated 'Coolie', which, as per early estimates, has recorded nearly double the earnings. The action entertainer has reportedly grossed Rs 11.63 crore India net across all languages so far, fuelled by massive fan turnout, particularly in South India.With both films eyeing a strong Independence Day holiday boost, trade analysts predict a huge Rs 80 crore combined box office earning this Thursday.For now, 'Coolie' holds the lead, but it remains to be seen if 'War 2' has what it takes to narrow the gap later in the day. Both films are also expected to receive a huge boost in collections on Friday, considering that it is a national holiday.

Initial reactions are divided, praising the action and star performances of Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR, while some criticize the storyline and pacing. The film's grand scale and thrilling moments are highlighted, but concerns arise over the second half's execution and predictable plot elements.  The much-awaited War 2 has finally been released in cinemas around the world, and fans of leading stars Hrithik Roshan with Jr NTR can't keep calm. Fans around the globe got together to celebrate the film's release by rushing to theatres to catch the early shows of the pan-India spy spectacle directed by Ayan Mukerji. The film that was touted to be one of the biggest cinematic events of the year, got a hero's welcome with some fans lining up as early as 4 am on Thursday morning to catch the screening. Some others even fired off crackers and conducted pooja ceremonies outside the theatres to celebrate its release.While fan excitement was sky-high, early Twitter reviews reveal a mixed bag — with praise for the action and star power, but criticism over the storyline, pacing, and execution.Within hours of its release, Twitter was flooded with posts from moviegoers sharing their first impressions. Many fans praised the film’s action-packed first half, admitting, "Very Good First Half."Several praised the engaging pace and larger-than-life moments, particularly the whistle-worthy entry scenes. A fan enthused, “Coolie will get a tough competition! #War2 is a clean Block Buster! What a dance, screen dominance of NTR.” Others appreciated the film’s grand scale and buildup.However, a section of the audience pointed out that while the first half was gripping, the second half felt comparatively weaker, with pacing issues and predictable plot turns. Some even summed up their experience with the blunt verdict saying, “#War2 is a strictly mediocre action thriller, leaning heavily on style over substance! The storyline is somewhat different from the previous spy universe films, which had potential but wasn’t able to fully capitalize on it.”Another summarised their experience as, “An okayish action entertainer. Not great, not bad either – strictly MID. Note: NTR fans should keep their expectations in check. There are moments where you whistle, but there are moments that will frustrate you.”Another claimed that the film's plot was 'recycled' saying, "War 2 is a recycled, same-old template with no genuine highs or enjoyable moments between the leads in a lengthy runtime. Overall it’s a disappointing action film in YRF series after Tiger 3."Still another added, "good back story, but story falls flat & predictable. Lacks emotional connect."Some outright disliked the film, calling out the over-the-top action, and 'wasted' potential of a Hrithik and Jr NTR collab. One said, "The movie feels like small ads of mountain dews stitched together with no screenplay, poor editing, Few cringeworthy dialogues, laughable action sequences twists which can be seen from miles, one expression acting by #JrNTR..big disappointment from #RRR star! The action scenes are so bad,it feels embarassing ( B2 Bomber scene was worst)...so far just Hritik all the way..The much awaited #JanaabeAali is worst song from movie so far! Unintentionally funny with average choreography!!!"Another said, "A rare North–South star combo wasted. NTR is utterly underused, the plot is template, action is bland, and execution is weak—leaving audiences walking out dissatisfied.""War 2 is terrible," said another and added, "The film starts really well and is very engaging till they force the dance sequence out of nowhere. The film is completely derailed out of track just before the 15 mins to interval. It’s all downhill after that."Fans of both stars, however, continue to defend the film’s larger-than-life scale, its stylish cinematography, and the thrill of seeing two powerhouse performers share the screen. "Just watched War 2 here in California. I must say it’s an excellent movie with all actors acting great & the story was awesome with lots of twists & turns. CGI was not the best, but everything else was just good vibes, good story. Fun & paisa vasool," said another viewer.Another claimed that the film "Opens new horizons for Spy Universe." The fan went on to add, "Nothing forced staying exceptionally true to story! Twists that keep you entertained to end and beyond. Action larger than life, scale grandest! Music surreal. Locations breathtaking. Entertainment to the core. Builds up."War 2 sees Hrithik reprise his role as Kabir, a RAW agent with a turbulent past, now facing off against elite operative Vikram, played by Jr NTR. The globe-trotting narrative promises espionage, betrayal, and explosive action sequences — hallmarks of the Spy Universe. Kiara Advani, Ashutosh Rana, and Anil Kapoor also play pivotal roles.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Regular consumption supports heart health by regulating blood pressure and cholesterol, boosts immunity with vitamin C, and promotes radiant skin through hydration and antioxidants. Additionally, tomatoes strengthen bones with vitamin K and support brain and vision health with essential nutrients.  Raw tomatoes are more than just a kitchen staple; they are a nutritional powerhouse that can support overall health in numerous ways. Packed with vitamins, antioxidants and essential minerals such as vitamin C, potassium, and lycopene, raw tomatoes provide a wide range of benefits for the body. Regular consumption can support heart health by reducing blood pressure and cholesterol levels, boost immunity, aid digestion thanks to their fiber content, and protect against chronic diseases including certain cancers.Beyond internal health, the antioxidants in raw tomatoes also benefit the skin, helping to maintain a healthy glow and combat signs of aging. Their natural hydration and low-calorie profile make them an ideal addition for anyone looking to maintain weight while improving nutrition. Versatile and easy to include in daily meals, raw tomatoes can be enjoyed in salads, sandwiches, salsas, or even as juice. This makes them one of the simplest and most effective ways to enhance your daily nutrient intake and promote long-term wellness. According to studies published in NIH and research done by Research Gate, this article explores why making raw tomatoes a regular part of your diet can be a game-changer for boosting heart, skin, and bone health.Health benefits of eating raw tomatoes dailyHeart health benefits of raw tomatoesStudies by NIH show, raw tomatoes are packed with potassium and lycopene, two nutrients that play a key role in maintaining heart health. Potassium helps regulate blood pressure, while lycopene works as a powerful antioxidant to reduce cholesterol levels and protect cardiovascular function. Eating raw tomatoes regularly may lower the risk of heart disease, improve overall circulation, and support a healthy cardiovascular system. Including them in daily meals is a simple way to give your heart a natural boost.Boosting immunity with raw tomatoesRaw tomatoes are loaded with vitamin C, a vital nutrient that plays a central role in strengthening the immune system. Eating them regularly can help the body fight infections more effectively, support faster recovery from illnesses, and maintain overall health. Vitamin C also acts as a powerful antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals, reducing inflammation, and supporting skin health. Including raw tomatoes in your daily diet can therefore provide multiple layers of protection, keeping both your immune system and overall wellbeing in top shape.Skin and hydration supportResearch published in Research Gate shows that raw tomatoes are naturally rich in water, vitamins A and C, and antioxidants, all of which contribute to healthy, radiant skin. Their high water content helps keep the skin hydrated, while vitamin C supports collagen production, essential for maintaining skin elasticity and firmness. Antioxidants like lycopene protect the skin from damage caused by free radicals and environmental stressors, reducing the appearance of fine lines and early signs of aging. Including raw tomatoes in your daily diet can help promote a glowing complexion and support overall skin health naturally.Bone health and essential nutrientsRaw tomatoes are a good source of vitamin K, which plays a vital role in maintaining strong bones and supporting proper blood clotting. In addition, minerals such as potassium and magnesium found in tomatoes contribute to overall skeletal health by helping regulate calcium balance and supporting bone density. Including raw tomatoes in your daily diet can therefore not only benefit the heart and skin but also strengthen bones and promote long-term musculoskeletal wellbeing.Brain and vision supportTomatoes are rich in beta-carotene, lutein, and lycopene, powerful antioxidants that according to a study in NIH supports eye health. Beta-carotene helps maintain good vision, lutein protects the eyes from harmful light exposure, and lycopene reduces oxidative stress. Regular consumption of these nutrients may also offer protective benefits for brain health, potentially lowering the risk of age-related cognitive decline. Including tomatoes in your daily diet is a simple way to support both eye function and long-term mental sharpness.Easy ways to include raw tomatoes in your dietSalads: Mix sliced tomatoes with leafy greens and herbs.Sandwiches & wraps: Add tomato slices for nutrition and flavor.Salsas & dips: Combine chopped tomatoes with herbs for a healthy snack.Juices & smoothies: Blend tomatoes with other vegetables for a nutrient boost.Incorporating raw tomatoes into your daily diet is an easy and effective way to support overall health. They provide nutrients that benefit the heart, boost immunity, promote glowing skin, strengthen bones, and support brain function. Beyond their nutritional value, raw tomatoes are incredibly versatile and can be enjoyed in countless ways, added to salads, sandwiches, smoothies, salsas, or simply eaten on their own. Making them a regular part of your meals allows you to take advantage of these health benefits consistently, helping to maintain energy, vitality, and overall wellness in a natural and enjoyable way.Also read| 13 Foods that can worsen anxiety and depression and what to eat instead"Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Essential precautions include carrying updated prescriptions, packing extra medication, and regularly monitoring glucose. Healthy snacks, staying active, and proper foot care are crucial for a safe and enjoyable trip. Prioritizing health ensures memorable experiences without compromising well-being.  Travelling offers a chance to explore new places, experience different cultures, and create lasting memories. But for people with diabetes, it also brings unique challenges, from irregular meal times and changes in activity levels to managing medications and dealing with unfamiliar foods. These factors can easily disrupt blood sugar control if you’re not prepared. The good news is that with smart planning and a few simple precautions, you can travel safely and enjoy every moment of your journey. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a study published in NIH, people with diabetes should take these precautions before travelling to stay healthy and manage blood sugar effectively.Don’t travel without these 7 diabetes safety checksCarry an updated prescription and medical documentsBefore you pack your bags, make an appointment with your doctor to discuss your travel plans. They can review your recent blood sugar trends, adjust your medication if needed, and ensure you’re fit for the journey.Always carry a few printed copies of your latest prescription, along with medical reports or test results from the past three months. If you’re travelling abroad, ask your doctor for a signed note describing your condition, your medication needs, and why you may be carrying syringes or insulin pens. This can help you clear airport security checks smoothly and ensure you get proper treatment in case of an emergency.Pack more medication than you think you’ll needRunning out of medicine in an unfamiliar place can be stressful, especially if it’s not easy to find the same brand or dosage. To avoid this, pack at least twice the amount of medication and insulin you would normally need for the duration of your trip.If you’re flying, keep your medicines in your carry-on bag, never in checked luggage, as extreme temperatures in the cargo hold can damage insulin. Also, divide your supplies between different bags so you still have some if one bag is lost or delayed.Keep your glucometer handyTravelling can disrupt your usual routine, which means your blood sugar may fluctuate more than usual. Monitoring your levels regularly is key to staying safe. Carry your glucometer along with extra test strips, lancets, and spare batteries.If you’re on a long journey, keep your monitoring kit, insulin, syringes, glucose tablets, and some snacks in a small, easy-to-reach bag—such as under the seat in front of you on a plane or bus. This ensures you can check your sugar and take action without delay.Carry healthy snacks for steady blood sugarUnfamiliar foods, irregular meal times, and long stretches between meals can make blood sugar control tricky. To prevent sudden spikes or drops, pack healthy, portion-controlled snacks like:Unsalted nuts or seedsFresh fruit (like apples or berries)Wholegrain crackersLow-fat yoghurtCut vegetables with hummus or a healthy dipHomemade sandwichesEating small, frequent meals instead of relying on three large meals can help you maintain stable glucose levels and avoid the temptation of unhealthy snacks while on the go.Keep moving but safelySitting for hours on a bus, train, or plane can affect your blood circulation, increase your risk of swelling, and raise the chances of blood clots. Get up and stretch your legs every hour or two, even if it’s just walking up and down the aisle.Once you reach your destination, try incorporating light exercise such as morning walks or sightseeing on foot. Just make sure to wear comfortable, well-fitted shoes to prevent blisters or foot injuries, as people with diabetes are more prone to infections and slow-healing wounds.Stay hydrated and avoid sugary drinksTravelling often means being outdoors for long periods, which increases your risk of dehydration, a condition that can cause blood sugar to rise. Keep a refillable water bottle with you and sip throughout the day.Avoid sweetened drinks, fruit juices, energy drinks, and aerated beverages, as they can cause sudden glucose spikes. If you drink tea or coffee, limit added sugar. If alcohol is on the menu, remember it can interfere with your blood sugar control, so it’s safest to skip it or drink only in moderation after checking with your doctor.Protect your feet with the right footwearFoot care is a top priority for anyone with diabetes. When travelling, choose comfort and support over fashion. Wear cushioned shoes with breathable material and avoid tight-fitting styles that may cause blisters.Avoid walking barefoot, even on beaches or around pools—as cuts, burns, or infections may go unnoticed and take longer to heal. Pack an extra pair of shoes and socks in case your footwear gets wet or uncomfortable.Travelling with diabetes may require extra effort, but it’s entirely possible to have a fun, stress-free trip if you plan ahead. Make your health a priority, carry your essentials, eat mindfully, stay active, and stay hydrated. With these precautions, you can explore new places, enjoy local experiences, and create lasting memories without compromising your well-being. After all, a well-planned journey is not just about reaching your destination, it’s about enjoying every step along the way, while keeping your health in balance.Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Reddit rumours fuel excitement among Indian fans – Here’s what we knowLollapalooza India 2026 might be shaping up to be its biggest edition yet. Rumours suggest global icons Billie Eilish and Linkin Park could headline, alongside major acts from America and India. Talks are ongoing with major alternative metal bands and EDM artists, but nothing has been officially confirmed.Nillohit BagchiUpdated: Aug 14, 2025, 10:57 IST  4  min read  The buzz around Lollapalooza India 2026 has officially begun, and if the rumours are true, fans are in for a massive treat. Insider chatter and Reddit claims suggest Billie Eilish and Linkin Park have already signed contracts for headline performances. While the organisers have yet to confirm, the news has set social media on fire, with fans speculating on what could be one of the most diverse and high-energy festival lineups in recent memory. Alongside these global stars, several other big names are reportedly in talks, making the Lollapalooza 2026 edition a highly anticipated event for music lovers in India and beyond.Rumour mill: Billie Eilish and Linkin Park to take centre stage in Lollapalooza 2026? According to insiders in Lollapalooza India’s Reddit subreddit (r/lollapaloozaind), Billie Eilish, fresh off her latest world tour, Hit Me Hard and Soft, could bring her signature mix of haunting vocals and electrifying stage presence to the festival. 
 Billie Eilish, fresh off her latest world tour, Hit Me Hard and Soft, could bring her signature mix of haunting vocals and electrifying stage presence to the festival (Credits: X/@billiesource)Scoopwhoop reported that the seven-time AMA (American Music Awards) winner Linkin Park may co-headline the music festival. The rock band’s involvement is equally exciting, marking what could be a rare and emotional live set for the legendary rock band. If confirmed, their inclusion would give Lollapalooza India a unique blend of alternative, pop, rock, and metal energy.
 Linkin Park may co-headline Lollapalooza 2026 India (Credits: X/@linkinpark)Sharing alleged inside information about Billie and Linkin Park’s rumoured sets, one Reddit user wrote, “I can confirm the following: Billie Eilish (for headline slot), Linkin Park, M.I.A., Raja Kumari, Raftaar have signed contracts officially. They are negotiating with My Chemical Romance, but the band wants more of a payout, which would affect the festival budget. David Guetta is in talks, but nothing has been signed yet, and again, like MCR, it’s both a logistical and financial issue. A lot of people have been saying Bruno Mars, but my source has told me that it is false, and they have not reached out.”

Well-known EDM artist David Guetta is also in talks, but nothing has been signed yet. As for the widely rumoured Bruno Mars, insiders insist there’s no truth to his inclusion.A dream come true for music enthusiasts in IndiaIf the rumours prove true, Lollapalooza 2026 could mark the first-ever India performances for both Billie Eilish and Linkin Park. For long-time rock and metal fans, Linkin Park’s arrival would be a dream come true, fulfilling years of anticipation after speculation that they might come in 2025. Their music shaped an entire generation, and seeing them live in India would be a historic moment.

Sugary drinks, processed snacks, and excessive caffeine can worsen mood. Limiting these while focusing on whole grains, fruits, and healthy fats stabilizes mood and improves mental resilience. Small dietary changes, alongside exercise and stress management, enhance overall well-being, fostering a balanced and healthier state of mind.  Diet plays a crucial role in mental health, influencing anxiety, depression, and overall mood. While lifestyle and genetics are important factors, certain foods and beverages can exacerbate stress, trigger irritability, or worsen depressive symptoms. Consuming high-sugar drinks, processed snacks, artificial sweeteners, and excessive caffeine can create energy spikes and crashes, negatively impacting both brain and body. Understanding which foods to limit and choosing healthier alternatives can stabilise mood, improve mental resilience, and support overall well-being. According to multiple studies from Harvard, NIH, and Frontiers, these are some common dietary triggers for anxiety and depression.Foods that may trigger anxiety and depressionFruit juiceWhile fruit is healthy, fruit juice lacks the fiber of whole fruit. Fiber slows the absorption of sugar, preventing sharp spikes and crashes in blood glucose. Drinking juice can quickly raise your energy and then drop it, leaving you feeling irritable and hungry. Instead, eat whole fruits for sustained energy and drink water when you’re thirsty.Regular sodaSugar-sweetened drinks, including soda, provide rapid sugar spikes with little nutritional value. According to the research published in NIH, there’s a direct link between excessive sugar intake and increased risk of depression. If you crave something fizzy, try sparkling water with a splash of natural fruit juice. It offers the sensation of soda without the excessive sugar.Diet sodaEven though it contains little or no sugar, diet soda isn’t harmless. Artificial sweeteners like aspartame and high caffeine levels can contribute to depressive symptoms and worsen anxiety. Limiting diet sodas and choosing naturally flavored water or herbal teas is a safer choice.White bread and toastAccording to Harvard Health Publishing, highly processed white bread converts rapidly into sugar, leading to energy spikes and crashes that may aggravate anxiety or low mood. Swap white bread for whole-grain varieties, which provide fiber and support more stable blood sugar levels.‘Light’ or sugar-free dressingsMany pre-packaged dressings use artificial sweeteners instead of sugar. According to a study published in NIH, ingredients like aspartame may negatively affect mood and contribute to anxiety. Making homemade dressings with olive oil, lemon juice, or vinegar can help you avoid these additives while enjoying a healthier flavor.KetchupWhile it may seem harmless, ketchup is high in sugar, even in “light” varieties, which may also contain artificial sweeteners. Excess sugar and additives can worsen mood swings and anxiety. Consider homemade tomato salsa with spices like cayenne for a flavorful, healthier alternative.CoffeeCaffeine affects everyone differently. According to a study published in Frontiers, for some, it can increase nervousness, jitteriness, and sleep disruption, factors that intensify anxiety and depressive symptoms. If caffeine impacts you negatively, consider decaf or gradually reduce intake. For those who tolerate it well, moderate coffee consumption may actually improve alertness and mood.Energy drinksEnergy drinks often contain excessive caffeine, sugar, and other stimulants such as guarana, which can trigger heart palpitations, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. Instead, stick to water, herbal tea, or a piece of fruit for a natural energy boost.AlcoholEven moderate alcohol intake can interfere with sleep, which is closely tied to mental health. While occasional drinks may relax you, overconsumption increases anxiety and depressive symptoms. Limiting to moderate levels—up to one drink a day for women and two for men—can help reduce these risks.Frosting and trans fatsAccording to a study published in NIH, sugary frostings and foods containing partially hydrogenated oils are linked to depression. These trans fats are found in fried foods, packaged snacks, and baked goods. Focus on “good” fats from olive oil, nuts, avocado, and fatty fish, which support brain health and mood stability.Soy sauce and gluten-containing processed foodsFor those sensitive to gluten, soy sauce and other processed foods can trigger sluggishness, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Always check labels and avoid items containing gluten if you notice negative effects.Processed and fried foodsFrequent consumption of processed meats, fried foods, pastries, high-fat dairy, and refined cereals is linked to higher rates of anxiety and depression. A diet focused on whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and fish is associated with more balanced moods and improved mental health.Doughnuts and sugary treatsWhile occasional treats are fine, doughnuts are high in sugar, unhealthy fats, and refined flour. Eating them regularly can worsen mood swings and contribute to anxiety or low mood. Make indulgences rare rather than routine.What you eat plays a crucial role in managing anxiety and depression. Limiting sugar, highly processed foods, artificial sweeteners, and excess caffeine or alcohol can reduce mood swings and anxiety symptoms. Focus on whole grains, fiber-rich fruits and vegetables, healthy fats, and proper hydration. Small dietary changes, combined with lifestyle measures like exercise, sleep, and stress management, can significantly improve mental well-being. By making mindful food choices, you support both your body and mind, fostering a more balanced, resilient state of health.Also Read: Coconut meat doesn’t raise blood sugar level: A diabetes-friendly snack and 3 groups of people who should avoid it"Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Coconut meat doesn’t raise blood sugar level: A diabetes-friendly snack and 3 groups of people who should avoid it
Recent tests indicate that raw, unsweetened coconut meat has a minimal impact on blood sugar, making it a diabetes-friendly food. Metabolic health coach Karan Sarin's CGM readings showed a negligible glucose spike after consuming coconut meat, unlike coconut water. Its high fibre and healthy fats promote satiety and support insulin sensitivity.

Metabolic health coach Karan Sarin's CGM readings showed a negligible glucose spike after consuming coconut meat, unlike coconut water. Its high fibre and healthy fats promote satiety and support insulin sensitivity.  Coconut meat, the soft flesh of mature coconuts, is not only tasty but also packed with nutrients, making it a popular choice for smoothies, snacks, desserts, and curries. For people watching their blood sugar, the question often arises: does coconut meat spike glucose levels? Recent tests using continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) show that raw, unsweetened coconut meat has a minimal impact on blood sugar, making it a low-glycemic, diabetes-friendly food. With its mix of fibre, healthy fats, and low net carbs, coconut meat can keep you full, provide sustained energy, and support healthy metabolism when eaten in moderation.Why coconut meat is a blood-sugar-friendly food Coconut meat is a nutritious food that has little effect on blood sugar, making it a good option for those watching their glucose levels. In 100 grams of raw coconut meat, there are about 15 grams of carbohydrates, 9 grams of fibre, 33 grams of fat (mostly saturated), and 3 grams of protein. The high fibre slows down digestion, so sugar enters the bloodstream gradually instead of causing a spike. The healthy fats, especially medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), provide quick energy without needing much insulin, which helps keep blood sugar steady. Since most of the carbs are from fibre, only about 6 grams are actually digested, keeping the net carbohydrate load low. This combination of fibre, healthy fats, and low-digestible carbs makes coconut meat a smart, blood-sugar-friendly food for meals or snacks. Karan Sarin (a certified metabolic health coach), who tests Indian foods to measure their impact on blood sugar, demonstrated in a video he shared on Instagram using a bowl of 50 grams of coconut meat.According to Sarin's CGM, or continuous glucose monitor reading, the spike was negligible after two hours compared to coconut water, which had a high spike. "There is no sugar spike. There is a flatline, which is a great outcome," Sarin stated in the video.Coconut meat as a snack for people with diabetesFor individuals with diabetes or insulin resistance, coconut meat can be a “smart snack,” thanks to its nutritional profile:Satiety without carbohydrate overload: The combination of fibre and healthy fats keeps you full for longer, helping control appetite.Minimal impact on blood sugar: When eaten in moderation, coconut meat does not cause significant glucose spikes.Support for insulin sensitivity: A 2017 study in the journal Nutrients highlighted that diets rich in MCTs, like those in coconut, may improve insulin sensitivity and aid in weight management, both beneficial for type 2 diabetes.Who should avoid eating coconut meat: 3 groups that need to be carefulWhile coconut meat is generally safe and beneficial for most people, certain groups should be more mindful of their consumption due to its high saturated fat and carbohydrate content:Individuals with high cholesterolCoconut meat contains a significant amount of saturated fats. Excessive intake may raise LDL (bad) cholesterol levels, potentially increasing the risk of heart disease over time. People who already have elevated cholesterol or a family history of cardiovascular issues should monitor their portions and avoid combining coconut meat with other high-fat foods in the same meal.Gestational diabetes patientsPregnant women with gestational diabetes need to carefully manage both carbohydrate and fat intake. Although coconut meat is low-glycemic, its saturated fat content can impact insulin sensitivity if consumed in large quantities. Consulting a healthcare professional for portion guidance ensures that both blood sugar levels and overall nutrient balance remain optimal for mother and baby.Consumers of sweetened coconut productsMany commercially available coconut products, such as sweetened shredded coconut, coconut chips, or dessert mixes, contain added sugars. These can cause rapid spikes in blood sugar, negating the natural benefits of unsweetened coconut meat. Individuals aiming to stabilise glucose levels should always opt for raw or unsweetened coconut and carefully read product labels before consumption.Raw, unsweetened coconut meat is a nutritious and low-glycemic food that can be safely included in a balanced diet when consumed in moderation. Its combination of high fibre, healthy fats, and low net carbohydrates helps prevent rapid blood sugar spikes, making it suitable for diabetics, individuals with insulin resistance, PCOS patients, or anyone mindful of glucose levels. Beyond stabilising blood sugar, coconut meat can promote satiety, provide sustained energy, and support metabolic health. By understanding its unique nutritional profile and practising portion control, individuals can enjoy the taste and benefits of coconut meat without compromising their health.

Colon cancer symptoms on skin: What you need to know
Colon cancer, primarily affecting the large intestine and rectum, can manifest rare skin symptoms like nodules, rashes, or pigmentation changes, indicating potential spread. A study from NCBI highlights that skin manifestations often signal metastasis, crucial for early diagnosis. Prompt recognition of unusual skin changes, especially with a history of colon cancer, necessitates immediate medical consultation for improved treatment outcomes.

A study from NCBI highlights that skin manifestations often signal metastasis, crucial for early diagnosis. Prompt recognition of unusual skin changes, especially with a history of colon cancer, necessitates immediate medical consultation for improved treatment outcomes.  Colon cancer, also called colorectal cancer, mainly affects the large intestine and rectum. It is among the most common cancers in the UK and globally. While digestive symptoms like changes in bowel habits and abdominal pain are well known, colon cancer can also cause symptoms on the skin, though these are rare. Skin signs such as nodules, rashes, ulcers, or changes in pigmentation may indicate the cancer has spread or is progressing. Recognising these skin symptoms early can be crucial for timely diagnosis and treatment, improving outcomes for those affected by this disease.How colon cancer can affect the skinColon cancer originates in the colon lining but can spread beyond the primary site. In advanced stages, cancer cells may metastasise (spread) to other parts of the body, including the skin. Skin symptoms related to colon cancer may be due to:Direct metastasis to the skinParaneoplastic syndromes (indirect effects of cancer through immune or hormonal responses)Side effects of cancer treatmentsCommon skin symptoms linked to colon cancerAccording to a study published in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), skin manifestations in colon cancer patients, such as nodules and rashes, often indicate metastatic spread and can serve as important clinical signs for early diagnosis and treatment planning. Recognising these symptoms promptly may improve patient outcomes by facilitating timely intervention.1. Skin nodules or lesionsOne of the most recognised skin symptoms of colon cancer metastasis is the appearance of firm, painless nodules or lumps on the skin. These lesions can vary in colour, often reddish, purple, or skin-toned, and may appear anywhere but are frequently found on the abdomen, chest, or around surgical scars.2. Skin rash or erythemaIn some cases, colon cancer may trigger a rash or persistent redness known as erythema. This can be due to paraneoplastic syndromes, where the immune system reacts abnormally to the presence of cancer.3. Skin ulcers and infectionsCancerous lesions on the skin can break down, forming ulcers or open sores that are slow to heal. These can become sites of secondary infection, causing pain and discomfort.4. Hyperpigmentation and other changesRarely, patients may experience changes in skin colour or texture, including darkening (hyperpigmentation) or thickening of the skin.Why do skin symptoms occurMetastasis: Colon cancer cells travel through the bloodstream or lymphatic system and settle in the skin, forming secondary tumours.Immune response: The body’s reaction to the cancer can produce paraneoplastic skin conditions.Treatment effects: Chemotherapy and radiotherapy can cause skin dryness, rashes, and sensitivity.According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, cutaneous metastases from colon cancer occur in approximately 3-6% of patients, indicating a poor prognosis but providing important clinical clues.When to see a doctorIf you notice unusual skin changes such as persistent lumps, sores that don’t heal, or unexplained rashes, especially if you have a history of colon cancer or related symptoms (e.g., changes in bowel habits, abdominal pain, unexplained weight loss), it is essential to consult a healthcare professional promptly.Early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes.Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Waking up at 5:30/6:00am to move my body when my bed was so hard, because that’s when the sleep was sweetest, But those early workouts gave me consistency and discipline, especially with staying committed to my required daily calorie deficit meal plan. Exercising early gave me an automatic energy boost to start my day right."4/11Intermittent fasting"I constantly made sure and was intentional with intermittent fasting detoxing 2-3 days a week, even on days I did not feel like , I made a rule to always include 2-3 days fruit/detox fast, this helped with snatching my waist line."5/11No to "night" outs"My friends didn’t always get it, but I knew my future self would thank me, and it will be all worth it and the end, and Yes it helped me from the endless cycle of having to restart my journey after overindulging whenever I went out. Staying inside helped me save my money and also lose more weight easily."6/11Need over want"This is a hard decision but I noticed, if I wait until I was really hungry before I had something to eat, I always end up over-Eating or excessively snacking later during the day, so I made a decision to eat when it’s my time to eat and not to keep pushing until I’m hungry and this helped eliminate cravings and I was always constantly satisfied with my daily meal portion, I stayed in a calorie deficit easily, and this is important to see results.”7/11Mental struggles“I learnt the hard way that losing weight is more mental than physical. The hardest part wasn’t my body, it was my mind telling me to quit. I had to fight the voice that said “It’s not worth it” and keep going anyway, I had to constantly remind myself that this is beyond weight loss, it's about a lifestyle change, maintaining a healthy body and breaking out of endless procrastination,” she said.8/11Consistency“Rain, cramps, bad mood, a bad day, and even on days when they scale decided to misbehave, I still showed up, even if it’s not 100 percent, because I know what matters is consistency, and to be honest, motivation didn’t get me results, discipline did.”9/11Patience“I’ll keep reminding myself that some weeks, my weight didn’t move at all, and I know it will hurt, but I’ll try my best to keep up showing up and pushing, trusting the process instead of letting frustration win and focusing on other ways of measuring my progress, like taking pictures and retaking my measurements,” she added.10/11Track, track and trackAmaka said tracking was annoying and time-consuming at first, 'but knowing exactly what went into her body kept her from lying to herself about my habits and food portions and helped her stay more on track'.11/11Divine intervention“This was less of a sacrifice. I constantly asked for help and strength from God daily to keep pushing, and he really failed me, because daily my strength failed me. He came through for me above my expectations, continuously renewed my strength, took control over my sugar cravings and blessed my hard work with amazing results.”These views are not generic in nature.

Rosemary plant: How to spot the real one from look-alikes
Rosemary, a fragrant herb, is often mistaken for other plants like Russian sage and lavender. Identifying real rosemary involves checking for needle-like leaves with a silvery underside, a piney scent, and  small blue flowers. Using the correct rosemary is crucial for cooking, as imposters can ruin the flavor of dishes.

Identifying real rosemary involves checking for needle-like leaves with a silvery underside, a piney scent, and  small blue flowers. Using the correct rosemary is crucial for cooking, as imposters can ruin the flavor of dishes.  If you’ve ever been at a farmers’ market, garden centre, or even your aunt’s backyard, you’ve probably seen what looks like rosemary. But here’s the thing, Mother Nature likes to play tricks. Several plants look suspiciously like rosemary, and unless you know what you’re looking for, you could end up sniffing (or cooking with) the wrong herb.Step one: Get to know the shape and sizeReal rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) is a woody perennial herb that looks like a tiny pine tree got a haircut. Its leaves are needle-like but not sharp, and they grow in dense clusters along upright, woody stems.Height: Usually 1–3 feet when grown in pots, but in the ground it can get up to 4–5 feet tall.Stems: Woody at the base, greener near the tips.Leaves: Narrow, about an inch long, dark green on top, with a silvery-white underside.If the plant in question has floppy stems, rounded leaves, or bright green all the way through, it’s probably not rosemary.Step two: Trust your noseThis is the giveaway. Rosemary smells… well, like rosemary: strong, fresh, piney, with a hint of lemon and camphor. It’s unmistakable once you’ve sniffed the real thing.A quick tip: rub the leaves gently between your fingers. If the scent doesn’t explode into that classic rosemary aroma, you’re holding an imposter.Plants that often get mistaken for rosemary—like Russian sage or lavender—smell different. Russian sage has a softer, more sage-like aroma. Lavender, of course, smells floral, not savory.Step three: Check the color contrastOne of rosemary’s unique features is that two-tone leaf. The top side is dark, almost forest green, while the underside is pale and silvery, thanks to tiny hairs. This contrast is much more pronounced in rosemary than in most look-alike plants.If your “rosemary” has leaves that are the exact same shade on both sides—proceed with suspicion.Step four: Notice the flowers (if it’s blooming)Rosemary flowers are small, delicate, and usually pale blue to purple. They pop up in late winter or spring (though some varieties flower more than once a year).Impostors like lavender have much bigger, more fragrant blooms, while Russian sage has taller, airy flower spikes.Common Rosemary impostors and how to bust themLet’s play plant detective and meet rosemary’s top look-alikes.Russian Sage (Perovskia atriplicifolia)Taller, with softer, more feathery leaves.Light purple flowers in tall spikes.Smells herby but not piney.Lavender (Lavandula spp.)Leaves are often more grey-green and softer.Strong floral aroma (amazing, but definitely not rosemary).Taller flower stalks.Bog Sage (Salvia uliginosa)Bright blue flowers.More upright and less woody.Mild scent.Bonus tips for buying the right rosemaryIf you’re buying fresh rosemary sprigs in the supermarket or farmers’ market in the US look for:Firm, upright stems (not floppy).Strong fragrance.No yellowing or dried-out tips.If you’re buying a potted rosemary plant for your garden or windowsill:Check the label for Rosmarinus officinalis.Avoid plants that look leggy or sparse, they might be stressed or mislabeled.Give the leaves a sniff before you hand over your cash. Why you really want the real thingBesides the fact that fake rosemary just won’t taste right, rosemary has unique oils, like cineole and camphor, that give it its distinctive flavor and potential health benefits. It’s brilliant for seasoning roasted potatoes, chicken, lamb, bread, and even cocktails.If you mistakenly grab Russian sage, your potatoes will taste… well, earthy and weird. And lavender? Let’s just say your lamb chops will taste like soap.Spotting the right rosemary isn’t rocket science, it’s all about looking closely, smelling deeply, and trusting your senses. Once you’ve locked in that scent and leaf pattern, you’ll never be fooled again.So next time you’re at the garden center, channel your inner herb detective.Disclaimer: This content is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional botanical advice.

Everyday lifestyle factors that could be raising your blood sugar
For individuals managing type 2 diabetes, maintaining stable blood sugar is crucial. Everyday Health reports that seemingly harmless habits can unexpectedly raise glucose levels. Skipping breakfast, hormonal changes, inactivity, stress, infections, certain medications, poor sleep, and gum disease are key culprits. Monitoring blood glucose alongside daily activities helps identify triggers, enabling better management and reducing diabetes-related complications.

Everyday Health reports that seemingly harmless habits can unexpectedly raise glucose levels. Skipping breakfast, hormonal changes, inactivity, stress, infections, certain medications, poor sleep, and gum disease are key culprits. Monitoring blood glucose alongside daily activities helps identify triggers, enabling better management and reducing diabetes-related complications.  Managing blood sugar levels is vital for living well with type 2 diabetes. While diet and medication are key, everyday habits can also significantly impact blood glucose control. Factors such as stress, sleep quality, physical activity, and even oral health can cause unexpected blood sugar spikes. These hidden triggers may disrupt your efforts, even when you’re following your treatment plan carefully. By understanding how these daily habits affect blood sugar, you can make smarter choices to improve control, reduce fluctuations, and lower the risk of diabetes-related complications over time. Awareness is the first step to better management.8 surprising causes of high blood sugarAccording to Everyday Health, these everyday habits could unexpectedly increase your blood sugar levels and affect diabetes management.1. Skipping breakfastMissing breakfast may seem harmless, but for people with type 2 diabetes, it can cause blood sugar levels to remain elevated throughout the day. Skipping this important meal may impair the function of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, making it harder to regulate glucose after subsequent meals.2. Hormonal changes during menstruationFor women, hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle can lead to noticeable blood sugar swings. Increased levels of oestrogen and progesterone around ovulation and just before the period can make blood sugar harder to manage. Tracking your cycle alongside your blood glucose readings can help anticipate these changes and adjust treatment accordingly.3. Physical inactivityRegular exercise enhances insulin sensitivity and helps cells absorb glucose for energy. Conversely, even a few days of reduced physical activity can cause blood sugar levels to rise. Incorporating consistent movement into your routine is key for maintaining good glucose control and reducing reliance on medications.4. Stress and cortisolStress triggers the release of cortisol, a hormone that can increase blood sugar by reducing insulin sensitivity. Both mental and physical stressors, such as work pressure, relationship issues, or injury, can cause unexpected spikes in glucose. Learning stress management techniques like deep breathing or short walks can help mitigate these effects.5. Infections and illnessWhen your body fights infection, it produces stress hormones that can raise blood sugar levels. This inflammatory response makes it harder to keep glucose in check, which is why sick days require special attention. Discuss with your healthcare provider how to monitor and manage your blood sugar during illness.6. Certain medications and supplementsVarious prescribed drugs and over-the-counter supplements can influence blood sugar. Always inform your doctor about any new medications or supplements to assess their potential impact on your diabetes management.7. Poor sleep qualityLack of sufficient sleep is linked to elevated stress hormones and reduced insulin production. Sleep deprivation can also increase hunger hormones, making dietary control more challenging. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep nightly to support stable blood sugar levels.8. Gum disease and oral healthEmerging research highlights a two-way relationship between diabetes and gum disease. Poor dental health can increase systemic inflammation and infections, which in turn raise blood sugar levels. Good oral hygiene and regular dental visits are especially important for people managing type 2 diabetes.Managing unexpected blood sugar spikesAwareness is the first step to preventing unexpected blood sugar increases. Keep a detailed log of your blood glucose readings along with notes on your activities, stress levels, sleep patterns, and medication changes. This information can help your healthcare team identify triggers and adjust your treatment plan effectively.Also read | How gout increases your risk of developing type 2 diabetes: Know the link between the twoAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Iceland leads as the safest, followed by Ireland and Denmark, according to the Global Peace Index. These nations, along with Austria and Portugal, offer travelers peace of mind amidst cultural heritage and natural landscapes. 12 That Europe trip that most of us have bookmarked and daydreamed about for ages? And if safety has been one of your concerns that has made you push back your plans, it’s time to put those worries at rest. You can say hello to peace of mind on your next trip! From Iceland’s glacier-kissed calm to Portugal’s sun-soaked streets, Europe’s safest countries serve up scenic views with zero stress. (Data sourced from Data Pandas)Safety isn’t just about locking doors or avoiding sketchy alleyways,it’s a lifestyle, a mood, and indeed matters wherever you are, especially when you are travelling. As such, the Global Peace Index (GPI), compiled by the Institute for Economics & Peace, ranks countries based on three pillars: societal safety and security, ongoing domestic and international conflicts, and the level of militarisation, can serve as a point of reference when planning that long-awaited trip. Read on to find the safest places on the list.Topping Europe’s safest list is Iceland, scoring 1.107, and that is because of Iceland’s longstanding stability, minimal crime rates, and cohesive society make it a haven for peace seekers.Next up is Ireland with a score of 1.288, where cordial international relations and progressive policies help the Emerald Isle maintain its low-crime, high-peace reputation. Then come the usual suspects for Nordic serenity: Denmark (1.296), Austria (1.300), and Portugal (1.301). If you like your peace served with scenic fjords or sunlit coastlines, these countries check all the boxes.Read more: How to see incredible India i just 2 weeksRounding out the top ten are Slovenia (1.316) and the Czech Republic (1.318)—perfect blends of cultural heritage, modern governance, and safe streets. Switzerland isn’t far behind at 1.357, living up to its “politically stable and secure” reputation. Hungary (1.411) and Finland (1.439) complete the top ten, showing that both Central Europe and the Nordic north have mastered the art of peace.Patterns and trendsA clear trend emerges: Western Europe and Nordic nations dominate the safety charts, consistently scoring high on GPI, thanks to strong institutions, social trust, and political stability. Meanwhile, Eastern European and Eurasian countries tend to occupy the lower rungs, reflecting regional disparities in security and conflict levels. Notably, countries like Ukraine (2.971) and Russia (3.275) scored significantly lower, highlighting heightened instability relative to their western neighbors.Read more: Temples, Taj, and Thar: An epic 15-day adventure in the heart of North IndiaThis geographic divergence paints a picture of Europe as a continent of contrasts: idyllic, safe havens in the west and north, coupled with regions still grappling with security challenges in the east.These safety scores aren’t just numbers, they’re travel guides, lifestyle indicators, and sometimes, reassurance that your dream European adventure won’t require constant vigilance. If your plan includes strolling cobbled streets in Iceland, sipping espresso in Austria, or hiking Portuguese hills without a care, the GPI rankings suggest you’re in for a calm, worry-free experience.From Iceland’s glacial calm to Finland’s northern tranquility, Europe offers a spectrum of safe havens where peace is more than a concept, it’s a lived reality. Whether you’re planning a vacation, considering relocation, or just daydreaming from your couch, these countries make the case that a good life is often the safest life.Top 25 of Europe’s Safest Countries (GPI 2025)Iceland – 1.095Ireland – 1.26Switzerland – 1.294Austria – 1.294Portugal – 1.371Denmark – 1.393Slovenia – 1.409Finland – 1.42Czech Republic – 1.435Netherlands – 1.491Belgium – 1.492Hungary – 1.5Croatia – 1.519Germany – 1.533Latvia – 1.558Lithuania – 1.558Estonia – 1.559Spain – 1.578Slovakia – 1.609Bulgaria – 1.61United Kingdom – 1.634Norway – 1.644Italy – 1.662Montenegro – 1.685Sweden – 1.709Source: Institute for Economics & Peace, Global Peace Index 2025.About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Potassium-rich foods to lower blood pressure: Bananas and broccoli explained

The study emphasizes the importance of the potassium-to-sodium ratio for vascular health, suggesting that incorporating potassium-rich foods into diets can improve cardiovascular health, especially for men.  High blood pressure is one of the most common health concerns worldwide, yet many people focus only on cutting salt to manage it. While reducing sodium can help, it is not the only or even the most effective way to bring blood pressure down. New research from the University of Waterloo suggests that increasing potassium intake through foods such as bananas, sweet potatoes, spinach and broccoli could have an even greater impact.In a study published in the American Journal of Physiology – Renal Physiology, researchers led by Anita Layton used a detailed mathematical model to examine how dietary changes affect blood pressure regulation. They found that raising the potassium-to-sodium ratio consistently lowered blood pressure, even when salt levels stayed the same. The effect was particularly strong in men, who showed greater improvement from higher potassium intake compared to women. High blood pressure affects more than 30 percent of adults worldwide and increases the risk of heart disease, stroke and kidney problems. This research offers a simple, accessible and science-backed approach for prevention. Rather than focusing only on reducing sodium, adding more potassium-rich foods to daily meals could become a key part of heart-healthy diets. Experts believe this shift in focus from restriction to nutrient balance could help improve cardiovascular health for millions of people.How potassium-rich foods help lower blood pressure naturallyPotassium plays a vital role in regulating blood pressure by helping the kidneys flush out excess sodium through urine. This action reduces fluid retention, which in turn eases the strain on blood vessel walls and allows the heart to pump more efficiently. Over time, this can significantly lower the risk of hypertension-related complications such as stroke, heart attack and kidney damage. The University of Waterloo researchers found that even without lowering salt intake, boosting potassium intake led to marked improvements in cardiovascular health markers. Men, in particular, showed stronger benefits from higher potassium consumption compared to women. This indicates that potassium has a blood pressure–lowering effect that works independently of sodium restriction.These results highlight how simple dietary changes, such as adding more potassium-rich foods like bananas, spinach, lentils and sweet potatoes, can be an easy yet powerful strategy for improving heart health. For millions of people living with or at risk of high blood pressure, focusing on nutrient balance rather than strict salt reduction may offer a more sustainable and effective path to long-term wellnessWhy bananas and broccoli are top potassium-rich foods for heart healthBananas and broccoli stand out as potassium-rich foods because they are widely available, affordable and versatile enough to fit into almost any diet. A medium banana contains about 422 milligrams of potassium, while a cup of cooked broccoli offers around 457 milligrams. These amounts contribute meaningfully toward the daily recommended intake, making them practical choices for supporting blood pressure regulation. Beyond potassium, bananas supply natural sugars for quick energy, dietary fiber for better digestion and vitamin B6 for nerve and metabolic health.Broccoli brings its own powerful mix of nutrients, including vitamin C for immune support, vitamin K for blood clotting and bone strength, and antioxidants that protect cells from damage. Together, they provide a nutrient-dense combination that benefits heart health, supports healthy circulation and promotes overall wellness. Whether blended into smoothies, tossed into salads, steamed as a side dish or eaten as a quick snack, adding bananas and broccoli to your daily routine is a simple step with long-term cardiovascular benefits.Potassium-to-sodium ratio: The key to controlling blood pressureThe study highlighted that it is the balance between potassium and sodium that matters most, rather than focusing solely on cutting salt. Maintaining an ideal potassium-to-sodium ratio supports vascular health, helps keep arteries flexible, and lowers the risk of hypertension. This nutrient balance improves blood flow and reduces strain on the heart over time.Researchers noted that this approach could be especially valuable in populations where salt consumption is high but potassium intake remains low, a pattern common in many parts of the world. By encouraging the inclusion of more potassium-rich foods rather than relying only on sodium restriction, public health programmes could offer a simpler and more sustainable way to reduce cardiovascular risk on a large scale.Practical tips to increase potassium-rich foods in your dietAdd sliced bananas to breakfast cereals or smoothies.Steam or stir-fry broccoli as a side dish for lunch or dinner.Include other potassium sources like spinach, lentils, and sweet potatoes.Balance high-potassium foods with moderate salt use for the best results.While reducing salt remains beneficial for heart health, the new findings suggest that increasing potassium-rich foods could have an even greater effect on lowering blood pressure. For most people, this does not require drastic or restrictive diets. Instead, it can be achieved through small, consistent changes such as adding bananas to breakfast, including leafy greens in lunch or dinner, and choosing beans or lentils as a regular protein source.These adjustments not only support healthy blood pressure but also provide a range of other nutrients that benefit overall wellbeing. By focusing on what to add rather than only on what to cut, people can improve heart health without sacrificing flavour or variety in their meals.Also read| Can your daily cup of coffee or tea boost your mood?

Cardiovascular diseases claim millions of lives annually, highlighting the importance of heart health. Incorporating leafy greens rich in Vitamin K, whole grains high in fiber, and berries abundant in flavonoids can significantly improve cardiovascular function. Avocados, packed with monounsaturated fats, and fatty fish containing omega-3 acids also contribute to a healthier heart. About 17.9 million die each year due to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) every year. CVDs are the leading cause of death globally, according to the WHO. Maintaining heart health is crucial, and diet plays a pivotal role in it. Here is a list of foods that can improve your heart health. Leafy greensEat your greens. Yes, that's right. Leafy greens such as spinach, kale, and Swiss chard are nutritional powerhouses. They are an excellent source of vitamin K, which helps protect arteries and promote proper blood clotting. A recent study from Edith Cowan University (ECU), the University of Western Australia, and the Danish Cancer Institute has shown that a cup and a half of leafy green vegetables could go a long way to addressing atherosclerotic vascular diseases (ASVD’s). The study found that higher dietary intake of Vitamin K1 can reduce the risk of ASVD. “Leafy green and cruciferous vegetables, like spinach, kale, and broccoli, contain Vitamin K,1 which may assist in preventing vascular calcification processes that characterise cardiovascular disease. The great news is that these vegetables can be easily incorporated into your daily meals,” the lead researcher said. Whole grainsRefined grains are your heart's biggest enemy. Instead, switch to whole grains, such as oats, quinoa, brown rice, and whole wheat. They are high in fiber, which helps reduce cholesterol and maintain healthy blood sugar levels. A 2021 study showed that eating more refined grains increases the risk of major cardiovascular disease, such as heart attack, stroke, and even death. Whole grains, on the other hand, are linked to a lower risk of heart disease.PollWhich food do you believe is the most beneficial for heart health?Leafy greensBerriesBerriesWho knew eating something as sumptuous as berries could actually boost your heart health! These include blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries. They contain flavonoids, which can lower blood pressure and reduce oxidative stress. A 2019 study by researchers at the University of East Anglia found that eating a cup of blueberries a day reduces risk factors for cardiovascular disease."Previous studies have indicated that people who regularly eat blueberries have a reduced risk of developing conditions, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This may be because blueberries are high in naturally occurring compounds called anthocyanins, which are the flavonoids responsible for the red and blue colour in fruits. We found that eating one cup of blueberries per day resulted in sustained improvements in vascular function and arterial stiffness - making enough of a difference to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by between 12 and 15 per cent," the researchers of the study said.AvocadosYes, the creamy green fruit can not only bless your taste buds, but also boost your heart health. They are rich in monounsaturated fats, which can help lower 'bad' LDL cholesterol and increase 'good' HDL cholesterol. A 2022 study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that eating two or more servings of avocado weekly was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. The participants in the study, who ate at least two servings of avocado each week, had a 16% lower risk of cardiovascular disease and a 21% lower risk of coronary heart disease, compared to those who never or rarely ate avocado.Diet to reduce body inflammation: Foods that help reduce inflammation.Fatty fishAnother way to enhance your heart health is to add more fatty fish to your diet. Fatty fish, such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, and trout, are rich in omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which have been shown to reduce inflammation and improve overall heart health. A 2023 study by researchers from Karolinska Institute found that the risk of CVDs can be reduced by eating more fatty fish. People with close relatives who have suffered from cardiovascular disease may also benefit from eating more oily fish."Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

People who live past 100 have one thing in common, finds study
A Swedish study tracking older adults reveals that specific blood markers, related to metabolism, inflammation, and organ function, correlate with exceptional longevity. Future centenarians often exhibited healthier, balanced readings in their 60s, suggesting these biomarkers can predict who might live past 100. Maintaining these markers within healthy ranges through lifestyle and monitoring may improve long-term survival prospects.

Future centenarians often exhibited healthier, balanced readings in their 60s, suggesting these biomarkers can predict who might live past 100. Maintaining these markers within healthy ranges through lifestyle and monitoring may improve long-term survival prospects.  What makes some people live to see a full century while others don’t? According to a Swedish study published in GeroScience by researchers from the Karolinska Institute, a surprisingly simple clue may lie within the body, distinguishing future centenarians from the rest of the population. Researchers tracked tens of thousands of older adults over several decades, observing patterns that hinted at exceptional longevity long before participants reached 100. While genetics, diet, exercise, and lifestyle factors continue to influence lifespan, the study found a consistent pattern in certain blood markers that strongly correlated with living past a century. These findings offer an intriguing glimpse into the biological secrets behind extraordinary longevity and could help guide future research on healthy aging.Key biomarkers linked to living past 100 The study analysed twelve blood markers connected to metabolism, inflammation, kidney and liver function, malnutrition, and anaemia. Researchers found that people who eventually reached 100 tended to have healthier, more balanced readings even in their 60s, suggesting that these biomarkers can provide early signals of exceptional longevity.Lower levels observed in future centenarians included:Glucose (blood sugar)Creatinine (kidney function)Uric acid (inflammation)AST/ALT (liver enzymes)Alkaline phosphatase (liver and bone health)Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, tissue damage)Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC, nutrition status)Higher levels observed included:IronTotal cholesterolResearchers noted that the readings of future centenarians were rarely extreme. Instead, most had moderate, stable values, highlighting that a balance in these biomarkers, rather than unusually high or low figures, may be key to longevity. Interestingly, these patterns were remarkably consistent across individuals, suggesting a common physiological profile among those who achieve exceptional age.The findings also suggest that maintaining these markers within healthy ranges may reflect both genetic advantages and lifestyle factors, such as a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and effective management of chronic health conditions. This early physiological advantage, evident even decades before reaching 100, underscores the importance of midlife health as a foundation for long-term survival.How these markers can predict longevityAll but two of the twelve biomarkers were found to have predictive power for reaching 100. Low iron or very low cholesterol appeared to reduce the likelihood, while stable kidney and liver markers, low uric acid, and low-normal blood glucose were strong indicators of longevity. Subtle differences in these measurements were often evident decades before the 100th birthday, highlighting the value of routine blood tests as a tool for assessing long-term survival prospects.Health and lifestyle in the journey to 100Many future centenarians already displayed fewer chronic conditions and healthier overall profiles by their 60s. This suggests that both genetics and lifestyle factors—such as diet, exercise, and preventive healthcare—play important roles. Women represented roughly 85% of those who reached 100, reflecting broader global longevity trends. The combination of healthy blood markers and fewer health issues in midlife appears to set the stage for exceptional longevity.What it means for the rest of usThe study’s findings hint at a practical takeaway: monitoring and managing key physiological markers can offer insight into long-term survival prospects. Paying attention to glucose, cholesterol, iron, inflammation, and kidney and liver health—even later in life—may improve the odds of reaching a century.

The body experiences this condition when it either fails to produce adequate insulin, or loses its ability to use insulin effectively. (Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps regulate blood sugar levels by allowing glucose to enter cells for energy) In most cases, Diabetes is usually not reversible, but it can be managed with a healthy diet, and medication. Both men and women can get Diabetes at any point in their lives, but the symptoms might be slightly different. Here are some early signs of Diabetes in men (however, these are not exclusive to the condition, and only a blood test can confirm the same)2/613/6234/6Erectile dysfunction and low testosteroneDiabetes creates specific sexual health complications which affect men. Erectile dysfunction is a typical symptom, which causes difficulties with achieving or sustaining an erection. The onset of erectile dysfunction occurs earlier in diabetic men compared to non-diabetic men. The condition develops because elevated blood sugar levels injure nerves along with blood vessels, which maintain normal sexual operations. Men who have diabetes face an elevated probability of developing low testosterone, which healthcare providers refer to as low-T. Decreased sex drive together with depression symptoms and muscle strength reduction are possible consequences of low testosterone levels in men. Retrograde ejaculation represents another possible condition, where semen enters the bladder instead of passing through the penis during ejaculation. These health issues stem from diabetes effects on hormone levels and nerve system health in men.5/6Slow-healing wounds and frequent infectionsDiabetes causes the immune system to slow down, thus making wounds and cuts heal at a slower rate. Men who have diabetes notice that their small cuts, infections and scrapes, require longer periods to heal than normal. The risk of developing serious or infected wounds becomes higher because of these factors. The symptoms of repeated infections include both urinary tract infections and fungal infections, that present as genital thrush. Yeast infections of private areas is also common, because the high sugar content in urine creates an ideal environment for yeast to multiply. The affected areas typically show redness alongside swelling and itchiness, along with white lumps on the skin surface.6/6Blurred vision and numbnessVision changes constitute a common symptom which diabetic men typically experience. Men with diabetes often experience fluid movement in their eyes, that distorts their lenses, thus producing blurry vision. The condition of diabetic retinopathy develops from blurred vision through extended exposure to high blood sugar levels. This also produces numbness, along with tingling sensations in the feet and hands of diabetic men. The body develops nerve damage from prolonged exposure to high blood sugar levels. The initial mild sensations from these symptoms can transform into severe discomfort before causing complete numbness. The symptoms of blurred vision and numbness indicate diabetes-related nerve and organ damage, which requires prompt medical care for proper management and prevention of additional damage.Sources:https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_symptoms_in_men/article.htmhttps://www.lybrate.com/topic/diabeteshttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/311173https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/understanding-diabetes-symptomshttps://www.nhs.uk/conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms/https://www.healthline.com/health/diabeteshttps://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/signs-symptoms/index.htmlDisclaimer: This article is informational only and not a substitute for medical adviceFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous9 gut-friendly drinks for the changing seasonFood​Jyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunning​indiaCelebrating 79th Independence Day: 10 slogans that inspired India’s freedom movement​indiaGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalindiaIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiindiaAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameindiaLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietindiaBirthday Special: Spine-chilling quotes of Alfred Hitchcock that will keep you up at nightindia10 baby names that mean creativity and visionindia Next123 Photostories  Cardiologist says these blood tests that can predict heart disease risks even before symptoms appearSachin Tendulkar’s son Arjun Tendulkar gets engaged to Saaniya Chandok: All about the couple’s family background and educational qualificationsTemples, Taj, and Thar: An epic 15-day adventure in the heart of North IndiaFrom bullied schoolboy to ₹3,000 crore superstar – Hrithik Roshan’s inspiring journeyThis is how cooking meat may increase the risk of cancerHow to see incredible India in just two weeksSeeds that supercharge muscle growth and overall healthNAFLD in kids: Harvard-trained doctor explains why this silent liver disease is on the riseFrom Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leaves123lifestyle videos13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement16:34Life After 60: Why India's seniors are choosing community living04:34Control Your Senses, Gain Knowledge, Attain Peace: Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4.3906:37Cultural Clashes in Love: How To Make Your Relationship Work03:19Prayagraj MahaKumbh 2025 Readies For Millions: Massive Preparations Underway In Uttar Pradesh04:48Sadhguru Reveals The Truth About Black Magic And Your Photograph07:18BK Shivani On Forgiveness: Why It’s Essential For Inner Peace08:08How Bhairavi Sadhana Accelerates Your Path to Liberation: Sadhguru Speaks06:47Breakup Recovery: How To Not Wallow In Misery And Love Yourself03:20The Purifying Power of Yajna: Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4, Verse 3011:41How Dattatreya Accepted Parashuram as His Disciple – Sadhguru Reveals03:54Can Water Remember?

Discover the age-old secret of using coriander, or dhaniya, for hair growth. This humble herb, packed with vitamins and antioxidants, can revitalize your scalp and promote stronger, shinier hair. Learn how to easily make dhaniya water at home and incorporate it into your routine for a natural, budget-friendly way to achieve luscious locks. Okay, picture this: you’re chopping coriander for your tadka, and your mum or dadi casually says, “Put some on your hair, it’s good for growth.” You roll your eyes because… how can pudina’s less glamorous cousin make your hair grow? Well, turns out, she was right all along.Yes, the same humble bunch of dhaniya you use for chutneys is basically a growth serum in disguise. Cheap, easy, natural and no, it won’t make your head smell like sambar.Why dhaniya deserves a spot in your hair routineLet’s give credit where it’s due. Dhaniya leaves are like a little green powerhouse. They’re loaded with Vitamin C, Vitamin K, iron, and antioxidants. Translation: they feed your hair follicles, improve blood flow to the scalp, and keep hair from falling out like autumn leaves.Plus, it’s one of those “kitchen to beauty shelf” hacks that’s been passed down generations. No chemicals, no fancy packaging, just pure, old-school magic.The easiest way to make dhaniya waterAlright, here’s the lazy-girl recipe.You will need:1 cup fresh coriander leaves (don’t be stingy, more leaves = more power)2–3 cups waterOptional: a few drops of coconut or castor oil if you want some extra oomphMethod:Wash the leaves properly because no one wants scalp dirt.Roughly chop them and throw them in a blender with 1 cup of water.Blend into a green paste - yes, it will look like chutney.Strain it with a fine sieve or cloth.Add the remaining water to dilute it.Boom. Your hair tonic is ready. Bonus points if you pour it into a spray bottle because it makes you feel like a fancy influencer.How to use it without making a messIf you think you can just pour it over your head and be done - nope. There’s a little art to it.Start clean - Shampoo first so your scalp is free from oil and gunk.Section your hair - Otherwise, you’ll miss half your scalp.Massage like you mean it - Pour/spray the dhaniya water and give yourself a nice scalp massage for 5–7 minutes. Feels heavenly.Wrap it up - Cover with a shower cap and chill for 30–45 minutes. Perfect time for scrolling Insta or stalking your ex’s new haircut.Rinse off - Use water or a mild shampoo to wash it out. If you added oil, shampoo twice.How often to use itTwo times a week is your sweet spot. Stick with it for a month and you’ll see less hair in your comb. Two to three months in, you might spot those cute baby hairs growing along your hairline.Remember, natural stuff takes time, this isn’t a “Rapunzel in 7 days” situation.Want to amp it up?Mix dhaniya water with:Aloe vera gel for extra moistureFenugreek water for dandruff dramaLemon juice if your scalp gets oily fastYou can even mix the coriander paste directly into coconut oil, massage it in, and leave it overnight if you want to go full TLC mode.Little things to keep in mindAlways do a patch test. Rare, but some people can react to coriander.Use fresh leaves, not dried coriander powder (your scalp is not a curry).Be consistent. Missing weeks will just take you back to square one.Why it’s totally worth the effortHonestly? In a world of hair products that cost more than rent, it feels good to go old-school. Dhaniya water not only helps with growth, it makes your hair shinier, softer, and stronger.Plus, there’s this smug joy when someone says, “Your hair looks amazing” and you go, “Oh thanks, it’s just coriander water.” Watch their face. Priceless.Next time you grab a bunch of dhaniya from the sabziwala, keep some aside for your hair. It’s budget-friendly, low-effort, and actually works. And who knows - in a few months, you might just have the thick, swishy hair you keep saving on Pinterest.About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Massachusetts Boston found that regular volunteering or helping others reduces cognitive aging by 15-20%. A recent study reveals that engaging in acts of kindness can significantly slow cognitive decline. Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Massachusetts Boston found that regular volunteering or helping others reduces cognitive aging by 15-20%. As you age, your brain tends to slow down. This makes simple everyday tasks, such as problem-solving, focus, and memory, a challenge. So, can you prevent cognitive decline? Or slow it down? Well, according to science, yes, it's possible. You can slow down cognitive decline. No, you don’t have to spend on expensive supplements or treatments to achieve it. In fact, it requires almost no money at all. A new study has found that a simple daily act can slow down cognitive decline. A new study led by the researchers at the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Massachusetts Boston has found that cognitive decline can be reduced by about 20% by a simple act of kindness. The findings of the study are published in the journal Social Science & Medicine. Helping others can reduce the rate of cognitive declineThe latest evidence shows that meaningful social connections improve health. The researchers found that helping others outside the home regularly can significantly slow cognitive decline in middle-aged and older adults. They noticed that regular volunteering can reduce the rate of cognitive aging by 15-20%.PollWhich type of helping do you think has more cognitive benefits?YesNoThe study involved more than 30,000 adults from the US over two decades. They found that the cognitive decline linked with aging dropped by 15-20% in people who formally volunteer their services or help in more informal ways with neighbors, family, or friends outside the home regularly. They noticed an improved cognitive function in those who set aside about two to four hours per week to helping others.“Everyday acts of support, whether organized or personal, can have lasting cognitive impact. What stood out to me was that the cognitive benefits of helping others weren’t just short-term boosts but cumulative over time with sustained engagement, and these benefits were evident for both formal volunteering and informal helping. And in addition to that, moderate engagement of just two to four hours was consistently linked to robust benefits,” Sae Hwang Han, an assistant professor of human development and family sciences at UT, who led the study, said in a statement. Helping rewards the brain Any act of helping or volunteering in either formal or informal ways, such as assisting neighbors, relatives, or friends in need with things like getting to a health appointment, caring for children, lawn work, or preparing taxes, is associated with improved cognition. “Informal helping is sometimes assumed to offer fewer health benefits due to its lack of social recognition. It was a pleasant surprise to find that it provides cognitive benefits comparable to formal volunteering,” Han said.The researchers also found that people who make helping behaviors a part of their routine, year over year, have greater benefits.

This suggests the importance of keeping older adults engaged in some form of helping for as long as possible, with appropriate supports and accommodations in place,” Han said. This study further emphasizes the need to discuss volunteerism, helping, and strengthening neighborhood relations, particularly in later life when diseases associated with cognitive decline and impairment, like Alzheimer’s, tend to set in.Another study led by Han also found that volunteering buffered the adverse effects of chronic stress on systemic inflammation, a known biological pathway linked to cognitive decline and dementia. The effect was especially pronounced among people with higher levels of inflammation.“Many older adults in suboptimal health often continue to make valuable contributions to those around them, and they also may be the ones to especially benefit from being provided with opportunities to help,” Han said."Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Travel-related stress together with feelings of anxiety stemming from plan changes and new environment, causes bowel function to slow down  Have you ever noticed that when you are traveling, your bowel habits go for a toss, even if you never have the issue at home? Travelers commonly experience constipation, which doctors refer to as traveler's constipation. Your digestive system reacts differently to the changes in your daily routine when you travel, thus causing this condition. But how can we fix it? Let's dig deeper...What is traveler’s constipationWhen traveling, most people experience constipation which includes either difficult stool passage, or infrequent bowel movements. The regular bowel movements that people experience usually at home, become disrupted during their travel periods. When traveling, the digestive system operates at a reduced speed, to produce tough and dry stools that become difficult to pass through the body. Most individuals experience this condition temporarily for the first few days of travel, and then it resumes back to normal. However, the condition can result in discomfort and pain that needs proper management.Why does traveler’s constipation happenMultiple elements work together to create constipation issues among travelers. Just like our body, our bowels, too, need a routine. The disruption of daily routines, alters your body's natural circadian rhythm which controls both digestion and bowel movements. Your digestive system experiences disruption because you travel between time zones, and eat at irregular times, and sleep differently than usual.Another major factor is dehydration. Airplane cabins contain dry air, and travelers usually do not consume enough water during flight, or even on the go, while sightseeing. When people do not get enough fluids in their body, the stool turns hard, which makes it hard to pass through the digestive system.Other factorsDiet too, plays a huge role. During your travels, you probably consume more processed food and heavy meals, alongside fewer vegetables and less fiber than you normally would. A diet with insufficient fiber content, leads to delayed digestion which results in constipation.Your intestines need movement to function properly, but travelers spend most of their time inactive during flights and car rides which worsens this condition. Travel-related stress together with feelings of anxiety stemming from plan changes and new environment, causes bowel function to slow down.Symptoms of traveler’s constipationTravelers who experience constipation usually show these typical symptoms:Having fewer than three bowel movements per weekThe stool becomes extremely hard and dry, while causing discomfort or difficulties during bowel movements.Fullness or bloating after eating, or after visiting the bathroom.Straining or pain during bowel movements.The mentioned symptoms produce mild discomfort, but usually do not pose significant threats to health. Medical help should be sought when constipation continues beyond a normal period, or when accompanied by intense pain or bloody stools.How to fix traveler’s constipationHere are some ways to fix this condition:1. Throughout your entire trip, you should consume lots of water because it will make your stools softer. Consuming large amounts of caffeine and alcohol should be avoided, since they have a dehydrating effect.2. Your diet should contain fruits and vegetables, together with whole grains and legumes, as these foods are high in fiber. The fiber content in your diet creates volume in your stool, which leads to regular bowel movements.3. Light walking and other forms of physical exercise will help activate your digestive system to relieve constipation.4. The practice of relaxation techniques which includes deep breathing and meditation, will help you manage stress because it affects digestion.5. You should never delay passing stools because this behavior will worsen your constipation symptoms. You should stick to your regular bathroom schedule while traveling.After consulting your doctor, you can consume supplements or laxatives when traveling.SourcesWhen Travel Stops You Up | Needham Gastroenterology AssociatesWhy You Get Constipated While Traveling - Cleveland ClinicHow can a person manage and prevent travel constipation? - Medical News TodayTraveler's Constipation: A Prospective Cohort StudyDisclaimer: This article is informational only and not a substitute for medical advice"Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Fatty liver disease in kids: Why this silent liver disease is on the rise
Dr. Saurabh Sethi highlights the alarming rise of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in adolescents due to unhealthy diets. Consuming sugary foods like pastries and soft drinks leads to excess fructose conversion into liver fat, potentially causing NAFLD. Untreated NAFLD can progress to severe liver issues, including cirrhosis, possibly requiring a liver transplant.

Dr. Saurabh Sethi highlights the alarming rise of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in adolescents due to unhealthy diets. Consuming sugary foods like pastries and soft drinks leads to excess fructose conversion into liver fat, potentially causing NAFLD. Untreated NAFLD can progress to severe liver issues, including cirrhosis, possibly requiring a liver transplant. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasingly becoming common among adolescents and young adults. Modern lifestyle factors, including poor diet, sedentary habits, and obesity, are key drivers of this issue. Dr. Saurabh Sethi, a California-based gastroenterologist trained at Harvard and Stanford, has now shared the shocking information on how the incidence of NAFLD is rising among kids. Dr. Sethi has explained how diet plays a key role in increasing the risk of NAFLD in kids. What is NAFLDNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common condition where fat builds up in your liver. It affects people who consume little to no alcohol. NAFLD is often linked to being overweight and can usually be treated with healthy lifestyle changes. Also referred to as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), this is a silent disease with few or no symptoms. In some cases, people may not experience any symptoms even if they develop cirrhosis due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), also referred to as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH).What makes NAFLD even more dangerous is that if left untreated, it can progress to chronic conditions such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and even liver cancer. This, over time, may also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.What are the symptoms of NAFLDMost people with NAFLD do not show any symptoms. Some people do not realise they have the condition until they discover it in some other test.Some of the symptoms include:Chronic fatigueFeeling generally unwellLiver pain or discomfort in the upper right side of your abdomen, under the ribsWhat causes NAFLD in children Dr. Sethi revealed that an unhealthy diet is one of the biggest reasons why children develop this condition. He explained that feeding children sugary foods can lead to NAFLD. “Serving your kid sugary foods like pastries, soft drinks, or cookies can be harmful. Sugar is 50% glucose and 50% fructose. While glucose provides energy to the whole body, excess fructose is converted into fat in the liver, potentially leading to fatty liver,” he said, in a video shared on Instagram. Kiara Advani’s 'War 2' Diet Revealed: Protein Pancakes, Grilled Chicken & No 'Quick Fixes'The liver specialist also emphasized that leaving this condition untreated may even lead to the need for a liver transplant. “If untreated, it can progress to severe liver issues including cirrhosis, which may require a liver transplant in extreme cases,” the doctor said.How to preventThe best way to prevent NAFLD is to focus on the lifestyle factors that are in your control, such as diet and exercise Eat a healthy, balanced diet rich in whole grains, vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, healthy oils, and low-fat dairy products.Maintain a healthy weightExercise regularly If you are overweight, lose the extra pound.

So, the ambitious dream of “seeing all of India,”  will be about a carefully curated itinerary with all the samples of colour, chaos, and charm. No itinerary will be perfect for such an epic trip, but this is how we are planning. If you have better ideas, do share with us, and we would not mind taking one or two detours on the way.2/9Fly into the Golden TriangleStart with Delhi, Agra, and Jaipur, which is often referred to as the holy trinity of first-time India trips. When in Delhi, include Mughal forts, trendy cafés, and popular markets for sure. Then head to Agra for the must-do Taj Mahal visit that will make you feel like you are in a dream. Next up is Jaipur’s palaces, pink-hued streets, and auto-rickshaw rides that will make you believe in colour therapy.3/9Try overnight trainsWhy waste precious sightseeing hours? India’s overnight trains will be a surprising and effective time-saving hack, but only if you plan it well in advance, as getting confirmed tickets can be a task at times, depending on the destination you choose.  Book AC 2-tier for a comfy-ish sleep, and you’ll wake up in a whole new city.4/9Mix metro cities with small towns For maximum coverage, don’t just city-hop. Balance the bustle of Mumbai or Kolkata with quieter, character-packed towns. Like for example Pushkar’s camel markets, Hampi’s boulder-strewn ruins, or Puducherry’s pastel French quarters. India’s small towns are sometimes the most charming surprises that you might not have expected.5/9Pick your mountains or beaches (or you can do both)Two weeks means tough choices. If you crave crisp air and Himalayan views, head north to Manali or Rishikesh. If your idea of bliss involves coconut trees and lazy sunsets, Kerala’s backwaters and Goa’s beaches will deliver. Trying to do both might be a hectic schedule, which will be tempting but ill-advised.6/9Say yes to street food, but with cautionYou’re not truly seeing India until you’ve eaten something from a cart that’s been parked in the same spot since the ’80s. Delhi’s chaat, Kolkata’s kathi rolls, Mumbai’s vada pav, each is a flavour explosion.7/9Follow the art of half-dayForget “one day per city.” In India, a half-day can fit a sunrise temple visit, a chaotic market, a street food lunch, and still leave you time to catch a train. The trick? Early mornings and ruthless prioritising. Pick 2–3 must-sees if you want to cover more in less time.8/9Use domestic flightsIndia is huge. So, domestic flights should be your pick if you need to travel from Jaipur to Kochi or Varanasi to Goa without losing two days on the road. There are budget airlines, and you can score budget tickets if you book early.9/9End with a ‘slow day’Your last 24 hours shouldn’t be a mad dash. Pick one city to just be. Maybe it’s watching the Ganga aarti in Varanasi, drifting on a Kerala houseboat, or sipping chai on a Goan balcony. Let the noise fade, and let the country sink in. India isn’t just about what you see, it’s about how it lingers with you.Follow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous​Jyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunning​indiaCelebrating 79th Independence Day: 10 slogans that inspired India’s freedom movement​indiaGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalindiaIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiindiaAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameindiaLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietindiaBirthday Special: Spine-chilling quotes of Alfred Hitchcock that will keep you up at nightindia10 baby names that mean creativity and visionindiaSet up a mini lotus pond at home with these easy tipsindia Next123 Photostories  From bullied schoolboy to ₹3,000 crore superstar – Hrithik Roshan’s inspiring journeyThis is how cooking meat may increase the risk of cancerHow to see incredible India in just two weeksSeeds that supercharge muscle growth and overall healthNAFLD in kids: Harvard-trained doctor explains why this silent liver disease is on the riseFrom Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leavesFrom Cristiano Ronaldo’s million-dollar sparkler to Arjun Tendulkar’s intimate proposal: Celebrity engagements that created buzz in 2025Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 symptoms of Liver disease that can be seen on hands and feet123lifestyle videos13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement16:34Life After 60: Why India's seniors are choosing community living04:34Control Your Senses, Gain Knowledge, Attain Peace: Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4.3906:37Cultural Clashes in Love: How To Make Your Relationship Work03:19Prayagraj MahaKumbh 2025 Readies For Millions: Massive Preparations Underway In Uttar Pradesh04:48Sadhguru Reveals The Truth About Black Magic And Your Photograph07:18BK Shivani On Forgiveness: Why It’s Essential For Inner Peace08:08How Bhairavi Sadhana Accelerates Your Path to Liberation: Sadhguru Speaks06:47Breakup Recovery: How To Not Wallow In Misery And Love Yourself03:20The Purifying Power of Yajna: Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4, Verse 3011:41How Dattatreya Accepted Parashuram as His Disciple – Sadhguru Reveals03:54Can Water Remember?

Regular consumption supports heart health by regulating blood pressure and cholesterol, boosts immunity with vitamin C, and promotes radiant skin through hydration and antioxidants. Additionally, tomatoes strengthen bones with vitamin K and support brain and vision health with essential nutrients.  Raw tomatoes are more than just a kitchen staple; they are a nutritional powerhouse that can support overall health in numerous ways. Packed with vitamins, antioxidants and essential minerals such as vitamin C, potassium, and lycopene, raw tomatoes provide a wide range of benefits for the body. Regular consumption can support heart health by reducing blood pressure and cholesterol levels, boost immunity, aid digestion thanks to their fiber content, and protect against chronic diseases including certain cancers.Beyond internal health, the antioxidants in raw tomatoes also benefit the skin, helping to maintain a healthy glow and combat signs of aging. Their natural hydration and low-calorie profile make them an ideal addition for anyone looking to maintain weight while improving nutrition. Versatile and easy to include in daily meals, raw tomatoes can be enjoyed in salads, sandwiches, salsas, or even as juice. This makes them one of the simplest and most effective ways to enhance your daily nutrient intake and promote long-term wellness. According to studies published in NIH and research done by Research Gate, this article explores why making raw tomatoes a regular part of your diet can be a game-changer for boosting heart, skin, and bone health.Health benefits of eating raw tomatoes dailyHeart health benefits of raw tomatoesStudies by NIH show, raw tomatoes are packed with potassium and lycopene, two nutrients that play a key role in maintaining heart health. Potassium helps regulate blood pressure, while lycopene works as a powerful antioxidant to reduce cholesterol levels and protect cardiovascular function. Eating raw tomatoes regularly may lower the risk of heart disease, improve overall circulation, and support a healthy cardiovascular system. Including them in daily meals is a simple way to give your heart a natural boost.Boosting immunity with raw tomatoesRaw tomatoes are loaded with vitamin C, a vital nutrient that plays a central role in strengthening the immune system. Eating them regularly can help the body fight infections more effectively, support faster recovery from illnesses, and maintain overall health. Vitamin C also acts as a powerful antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals, reducing inflammation, and supporting skin health. Including raw tomatoes in your daily diet can therefore provide multiple layers of protection, keeping both your immune system and overall wellbeing in top shape.Skin and hydration supportResearch published in Research Gate shows that raw tomatoes are naturally rich in water, vitamins A and C, and antioxidants, all of which contribute to healthy, radiant skin. Their high water content helps keep the skin hydrated, while vitamin C supports collagen production, essential for maintaining skin elasticity and firmness. Antioxidants like lycopene protect the skin from damage caused by free radicals and environmental stressors, reducing the appearance of fine lines and early signs of aging. Including raw tomatoes in your daily diet can help promote a glowing complexion and support overall skin health naturally.Bone health and essential nutrientsRaw tomatoes are a good source of vitamin K, which plays a vital role in maintaining strong bones and supporting proper blood clotting. In addition, minerals such as potassium and magnesium found in tomatoes contribute to overall skeletal health by helping regulate calcium balance and supporting bone density. Including raw tomatoes in your daily diet can therefore not only benefit the heart and skin but also strengthen bones and promote long-term musculoskeletal wellbeing.Brain and vision supportTomatoes are rich in beta-carotene, lutein, and lycopene, powerful antioxidants that according to a study in NIH supports eye health. Beta-carotene helps maintain good vision, lutein protects the eyes from harmful light exposure, and lycopene reduces oxidative stress. Regular consumption of these nutrients may also offer protective benefits for brain health, potentially lowering the risk of age-related cognitive decline. Including tomatoes in your daily diet is a simple way to support both eye function and long-term mental sharpness.Easy ways to include raw tomatoes in your dietSalads: Mix sliced tomatoes with leafy greens and herbs.Sandwiches & wraps: Add tomato slices for nutrition and flavor.Salsas & dips: Combine chopped tomatoes with herbs for a healthy snack.Juices & smoothies: Blend tomatoes with other vegetables for a nutrient boost.Incorporating raw tomatoes into your daily diet is an easy and effective way to support overall health. They provide nutrients that benefit the heart, boost immunity, promote glowing skin, strengthen bones, and support brain function. Beyond their nutritional value, raw tomatoes are incredibly versatile and can be enjoyed in countless ways, added to salads, sandwiches, smoothies, salsas, or simply eaten on their own. Making them a regular part of your meals allows you to take advantage of these health benefits consistently, helping to maintain energy, vitality, and overall wellness in a natural and enjoyable way.Also read| 13 Foods that can worsen anxiety and depression and what to eat instead"Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Essential precautions include carrying updated prescriptions, packing extra medication, and regularly monitoring glucose. Healthy snacks, staying active, and proper foot care are crucial for a safe and enjoyable trip. Prioritizing health ensures memorable experiences without compromising well-being.  Travelling offers a chance to explore new places, experience different cultures, and create lasting memories. But for people with diabetes, it also brings unique challenges, from irregular meal times and changes in activity levels to managing medications and dealing with unfamiliar foods. These factors can easily disrupt blood sugar control if you’re not prepared. The good news is that with smart planning and a few simple precautions, you can travel safely and enjoy every moment of your journey. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a study published in NIH, people with diabetes should take these precautions before travelling to stay healthy and manage blood sugar effectively.Don’t travel without these 7 diabetes safety checksCarry an updated prescription and medical documentsBefore you pack your bags, make an appointment with your doctor to discuss your travel plans. They can review your recent blood sugar trends, adjust your medication if needed, and ensure you’re fit for the journey.Always carry a few printed copies of your latest prescription, along with medical reports or test results from the past three months. If you’re travelling abroad, ask your doctor for a signed note describing your condition, your medication needs, and why you may be carrying syringes or insulin pens. This can help you clear airport security checks smoothly and ensure you get proper treatment in case of an emergency.Pack more medication than you think you’ll needRunning out of medicine in an unfamiliar place can be stressful, especially if it’s not easy to find the same brand or dosage. To avoid this, pack at least twice the amount of medication and insulin you would normally need for the duration of your trip.If you’re flying, keep your medicines in your carry-on bag, never in checked luggage, as extreme temperatures in the cargo hold can damage insulin. Also, divide your supplies between different bags so you still have some if one bag is lost or delayed.Keep your glucometer handyTravelling can disrupt your usual routine, which means your blood sugar may fluctuate more than usual. Monitoring your levels regularly is key to staying safe. Carry your glucometer along with extra test strips, lancets, and spare batteries.If you’re on a long journey, keep your monitoring kit, insulin, syringes, glucose tablets, and some snacks in a small, easy-to-reach bag—such as under the seat in front of you on a plane or bus. This ensures you can check your sugar and take action without delay.Carry healthy snacks for steady blood sugarUnfamiliar foods, irregular meal times, and long stretches between meals can make blood sugar control tricky. To prevent sudden spikes or drops, pack healthy, portion-controlled snacks like:Unsalted nuts or seedsFresh fruit (like apples or berries)Wholegrain crackersLow-fat yoghurtCut vegetables with hummus or a healthy dipHomemade sandwichesEating small, frequent meals instead of relying on three large meals can help you maintain stable glucose levels and avoid the temptation of unhealthy snacks while on the go.Keep moving but safelySitting for hours on a bus, train, or plane can affect your blood circulation, increase your risk of swelling, and raise the chances of blood clots. Get up and stretch your legs every hour or two, even if it’s just walking up and down the aisle.Once you reach your destination, try incorporating light exercise such as morning walks or sightseeing on foot. Just make sure to wear comfortable, well-fitted shoes to prevent blisters or foot injuries, as people with diabetes are more prone to infections and slow-healing wounds.Stay hydrated and avoid sugary drinksTravelling often means being outdoors for long periods, which increases your risk of dehydration, a condition that can cause blood sugar to rise. Keep a refillable water bottle with you and sip throughout the day.Avoid sweetened drinks, fruit juices, energy drinks, and aerated beverages, as they can cause sudden glucose spikes. If you drink tea or coffee, limit added sugar. If alcohol is on the menu, remember it can interfere with your blood sugar control, so it’s safest to skip it or drink only in moderation after checking with your doctor.Protect your feet with the right footwearFoot care is a top priority for anyone with diabetes. When travelling, choose comfort and support over fashion. Wear cushioned shoes with breathable material and avoid tight-fitting styles that may cause blisters.Avoid walking barefoot, even on beaches or around pools—as cuts, burns, or infections may go unnoticed and take longer to heal. Pack an extra pair of shoes and socks in case your footwear gets wet or uncomfortable.Travelling with diabetes may require extra effort, but it’s entirely possible to have a fun, stress-free trip if you plan ahead. Make your health a priority, carry your essentials, eat mindfully, stay active, and stay hydrated. With these precautions, you can explore new places, enjoy local experiences, and create lasting memories without compromising your well-being. After all, a well-planned journey is not just about reaching your destination, it’s about enjoying every step along the way, while keeping your health in balance.Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Reddit rumours fuel excitement among Indian fans – Here’s what we knowLollapalooza India 2026 might be shaping up to be its biggest edition yet. Rumours suggest global icons Billie Eilish and Linkin Park could headline, alongside major acts from America and India. Talks are ongoing with major alternative metal bands and EDM artists, but nothing has been officially confirmed.Nillohit BagchiUpdated: Aug 14, 2025, 10:57 IST  4  min read  The buzz around Lollapalooza India 2026 has officially begun, and if the rumours are true, fans are in for a massive treat. Insider chatter and Reddit claims suggest Billie Eilish and Linkin Park have already signed contracts for headline performances. While the organisers have yet to confirm, the news has set social media on fire, with fans speculating on what could be one of the most diverse and high-energy festival lineups in recent memory. Alongside these global stars, several other big names are reportedly in talks, making the Lollapalooza 2026 edition a highly anticipated event for music lovers in India and beyond.Rumour mill: Billie Eilish and Linkin Park to take centre stage in Lollapalooza 2026? According to insiders in Lollapalooza India’s Reddit subreddit (r/lollapaloozaind), Billie Eilish, fresh off her latest world tour, Hit Me Hard and Soft, could bring her signature mix of haunting vocals and electrifying stage presence to the festival.

The rock band’s involvement is equally exciting, marking what could be a rare and emotional live set for the legendary rock band. If confirmed, their inclusion would give Lollapalooza India a unique blend of alternative, pop, rock, and metal energy.
 Linkin Park may co-headline Lollapalooza 2026 India (Credits: X/@linkinpark)Sharing alleged inside information about Billie and Linkin Park’s rumoured sets, one Reddit user wrote, “I can confirm the following: Billie Eilish (for headline slot), Linkin Park, M.I.A., Raja Kumari, Raftaar have signed contracts officially. They are negotiating with My Chemical Romance, but the band wants more of a payout, which would affect the festival budget. David Guetta is in talks, but nothing has been signed yet, and again, like MCR, it’s both a logistical and financial issue. A lot of people have been saying Bruno Mars, but my source has told me that it is false, and they have not reached out.”

Negotiations are reportedly ongoing with American alt rock/metal band, My Chemical Romance (Credits: X/@rt_yourfavbands)Negotiations are reportedly ongoing with American alt-rock/metal band My Chemical Romance, though budget concerns are creating hurdles. Well-known EDM artist David Guetta is also in talks, but nothing has been signed yet. As for the widely rumoured Bruno Mars, insiders insist there’s no truth to his inclusion.A dream come true for music enthusiasts in IndiaIf the rumours prove true, Lollapalooza 2026 could mark the first-ever India performances for both Billie Eilish and Linkin Park. For long-time rock and metal fans, Linkin Park’s arrival would be a dream come true, fulfilling years of anticipation after speculation that they might come in 2025. Their music shaped an entire generation, and seeing them live in India would be a historic moment. 
Billie Eilish commands a massive fanbase in India (Credits: X/@billiesource)On the other hand, Gen Z favourite Billie Eilish commands a massive fanbase in the country, with her unique style and chart-topping hits making her one of the most anticipated potential headliners of the festival.Despite the growing excitement, festival organisers have not confirmed any of these names. Lollapalooza India is known for delivering big surprises, so fans will have to wait for the official lineup announcement. Until then, speculation will continue, and if these rumours turn into reality, 2026 might just be Indian music fans’ biggest year yet.

Sugary drinks, processed snacks, and excessive caffeine can worsen mood. Limiting these while focusing on whole grains, fruits, and healthy fats stabilizes mood and improves mental resilience. Small dietary changes, alongside exercise and stress management, enhance overall well-being, fostering a balanced and healthier state of mind.  Diet plays a crucial role in mental health, influencing anxiety, depression, and overall mood. While lifestyle and genetics are important factors, certain foods and beverages can exacerbate stress, trigger irritability, or worsen depressive symptoms. Consuming high-sugar drinks, processed snacks, artificial sweeteners, and excessive caffeine can create energy spikes and crashes, negatively impacting both brain and body. Understanding which foods to limit and choosing healthier alternatives can stabilise mood, improve mental resilience, and support overall well-being. According to multiple studies from Harvard, NIH, and Frontiers, these are some common dietary triggers for anxiety and depression.Foods that may trigger anxiety and depressionFruit juiceWhile fruit is healthy, fruit juice lacks the fiber of whole fruit. Fiber slows the absorption of sugar, preventing sharp spikes and crashes in blood glucose. Drinking juice can quickly raise your energy and then drop it, leaving you feeling irritable and hungry. Instead, eat whole fruits for sustained energy and drink water when you’re thirsty.Regular sodaSugar-sweetened drinks, including soda, provide rapid sugar spikes with little nutritional value. According to the research published in NIH, there’s a direct link between excessive sugar intake and increased risk of depression. If you crave something fizzy, try sparkling water with a splash of natural fruit juice. It offers the sensation of soda without the excessive sugar.Diet sodaEven though it contains little or no sugar, diet soda isn’t harmless. Artificial sweeteners like aspartame and high caffeine levels can contribute to depressive symptoms and worsen anxiety. Limiting diet sodas and choosing naturally flavored water or herbal teas is a safer choice.White bread and toastAccording to Harvard Health Publishing, highly processed white bread converts rapidly into sugar, leading to energy spikes and crashes that may aggravate anxiety or low mood. Swap white bread for whole-grain varieties, which provide fiber and support more stable blood sugar levels.‘Light’ or sugar-free dressingsMany pre-packaged dressings use artificial sweeteners instead of sugar. According to a study published in NIH, ingredients like aspartame may negatively affect mood and contribute to anxiety. Making homemade dressings with olive oil, lemon juice, or vinegar can help you avoid these additives while enjoying a healthier flavor.KetchupWhile it may seem harmless, ketchup is high in sugar, even in “light” varieties, which may also contain artificial sweeteners. Excess sugar and additives can worsen mood swings and anxiety. Consider homemade tomato salsa with spices like cayenne for a flavorful, healthier alternative.CoffeeCaffeine affects everyone differently. According to a study published in Frontiers, for some, it can increase nervousness, jitteriness, and sleep disruption, factors that intensify anxiety and depressive symptoms. If caffeine impacts you negatively, consider decaf or gradually reduce intake. For those who tolerate it well, moderate coffee consumption may actually improve alertness and mood.Energy drinksEnergy drinks often contain excessive caffeine, sugar, and other stimulants such as guarana, which can trigger heart palpitations, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. Instead, stick to water, herbal tea, or a piece of fruit for a natural energy boost.AlcoholEven moderate alcohol intake can interfere with sleep, which is closely tied to mental health. While occasional drinks may relax you, overconsumption increases anxiety and depressive symptoms. Limiting to moderate levels—up to one drink a day for women and two for men—can help reduce these risks.Frosting and trans fatsAccording to a study published in NIH, sugary frostings and foods containing partially hydrogenated oils are linked to depression. These trans fats are found in fried foods, packaged snacks, and baked goods. Focus on “good” fats from olive oil, nuts, avocado, and fatty fish, which support brain health and mood stability.Soy sauce and gluten-containing processed foodsFor those sensitive to gluten, soy sauce and other processed foods can trigger sluggishness, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Always check labels and avoid items containing gluten if you notice negative effects.Processed and fried foodsFrequent consumption of processed meats, fried foods, pastries, high-fat dairy, and refined cereals is linked to higher rates of anxiety and depression. A diet focused on whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and fish is associated with more balanced moods and improved mental health.Doughnuts and sugary treatsWhile occasional treats are fine, doughnuts are high in sugar, unhealthy fats, and refined flour. Eating them regularly can worsen mood swings and contribute to anxiety or low mood. Make indulgences rare rather than routine.What you eat plays a crucial role in managing anxiety and depression. Limiting sugar, highly processed foods, artificial sweeteners, and excess caffeine or alcohol can reduce mood swings and anxiety symptoms. Focus on whole grains, fiber-rich fruits and vegetables, healthy fats, and proper hydration. Small dietary changes, combined with lifestyle measures like exercise, sleep, and stress management, can significantly improve mental well-being. By making mindful food choices, you support both your body and mind, fostering a more balanced, resilient state of health.Also Read: Coconut meat doesn’t raise blood sugar level: A diabetes-friendly snack and 3 groups of people who should avoid it"Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Coconut meat doesn’t raise blood sugar level: A diabetes-friendly snack and 3 groups of people who should avoid it
Recent tests indicate that raw, unsweetened coconut meat has a minimal impact on blood sugar, making it a diabetes-friendly food. Metabolic health coach Karan Sarin's CGM readings showed a negligible glucose spike after consuming coconut meat, unlike coconut water. Its high fibre and healthy fats promote satiety and support insulin sensitivity.

Metabolic health coach Karan Sarin's CGM readings showed a negligible glucose spike after consuming coconut meat, unlike coconut water. Its high fibre and healthy fats promote satiety and support insulin sensitivity.  Coconut meat, the soft flesh of mature coconuts, is not only tasty but also packed with nutrients, making it a popular choice for smoothies, snacks, desserts, and curries. For people watching their blood sugar, the question often arises: does coconut meat spike glucose levels? Recent tests using continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) show that raw, unsweetened coconut meat has a minimal impact on blood sugar, making it a low-glycemic, diabetes-friendly food. With its mix of fibre, healthy fats, and low net carbs, coconut meat can keep you full, provide sustained energy, and support healthy metabolism when eaten in moderation.Why coconut meat is a blood-sugar-friendly food Coconut meat is a nutritious food that has little effect on blood sugar, making it a good option for those watching their glucose levels. In 100 grams of raw coconut meat, there are about 15 grams of carbohydrates, 9 grams of fibre, 33 grams of fat (mostly saturated), and 3 grams of protein. The high fibre slows down digestion, so sugar enters the bloodstream gradually instead of causing a spike. The healthy fats, especially medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), provide quick energy without needing much insulin, which helps keep blood sugar steady. Since most of the carbs are from fibre, only about 6 grams are actually digested, keeping the net carbohydrate load low. This combination of fibre, healthy fats, and low-digestible carbs makes coconut meat a smart, blood-sugar-friendly food for meals or snacks. Karan Sarin (a certified metabolic health coach), who tests Indian foods to measure their impact on blood sugar, demonstrated in a video he shared on Instagram using a bowl of 50 grams of coconut meat.According to Sarin's CGM, or continuous glucose monitor reading, the spike was negligible after two hours compared to coconut water, which had a high spike. "There is no sugar spike. There is a flatline, which is a great outcome," Sarin stated in the video.Coconut meat as a snack for people with diabetesFor individuals with diabetes or insulin resistance, coconut meat can be a “smart snack,” thanks to its nutritional profile:Satiety without carbohydrate overload: The combination of fibre and healthy fats keeps you full for longer, helping control appetite.Minimal impact on blood sugar: When eaten in moderation, coconut meat does not cause significant glucose spikes.Support for insulin sensitivity: A 2017 study in the journal Nutrients highlighted that diets rich in MCTs, like those in coconut, may improve insulin sensitivity and aid in weight management, both beneficial for type 2 diabetes.Who should avoid eating coconut meat: 3 groups that need to be carefulWhile coconut meat is generally safe and beneficial for most people, certain groups should be more mindful of their consumption due to its high saturated fat and carbohydrate content:Individuals with high cholesterolCoconut meat contains a significant amount of saturated fats. Excessive intake may raise LDL (bad) cholesterol levels, potentially increasing the risk of heart disease over time. People who already have elevated cholesterol or a family history of cardiovascular issues should monitor their portions and avoid combining coconut meat with other high-fat foods in the same meal.Gestational diabetes patientsPregnant women with gestational diabetes need to carefully manage both carbohydrate and fat intake. Although coconut meat is low-glycemic, its saturated fat content can impact insulin sensitivity if consumed in large quantities. Consulting a healthcare professional for portion guidance ensures that both blood sugar levels and overall nutrient balance remain optimal for mother and baby.Consumers of sweetened coconut productsMany commercially available coconut products, such as sweetened shredded coconut, coconut chips, or dessert mixes, contain added sugars. These can cause rapid spikes in blood sugar, negating the natural benefits of unsweetened coconut meat. Individuals aiming to stabilise glucose levels should always opt for raw or unsweetened coconut and carefully read product labels before consumption.Raw, unsweetened coconut meat is a nutritious and low-glycemic food that can be safely included in a balanced diet when consumed in moderation. Its combination of high fibre, healthy fats, and low net carbohydrates helps prevent rapid blood sugar spikes, making it suitable for diabetics, individuals with insulin resistance, PCOS patients, or anyone mindful of glucose levels. Beyond stabilising blood sugar, coconut meat can promote satiety, provide sustained energy, and support metabolic health. By understanding its unique nutritional profile and practising portion control, individuals can enjoy the taste and benefits of coconut meat without compromising their health.

Colon cancer symptoms on skin: What you need to know
Colon cancer, primarily affecting the large intestine and rectum, can manifest rare skin symptoms like nodules, rashes, or pigmentation changes, indicating potential spread. A study from NCBI highlights that skin manifestations often signal metastasis, crucial for early diagnosis. Prompt recognition of unusual skin changes, especially with a history of colon cancer, necessitates immediate medical consultation for improved treatment outcomes.

A study from NCBI highlights that skin manifestations often signal metastasis, crucial for early diagnosis. Prompt recognition of unusual skin changes, especially with a history of colon cancer, necessitates immediate medical consultation for improved treatment outcomes.  Colon cancer, also called colorectal cancer, mainly affects the large intestine and rectum. It is among the most common cancers in the UK and globally. While digestive symptoms like changes in bowel habits and abdominal pain are well known, colon cancer can also cause symptoms on the skin, though these are rare. Skin signs such as nodules, rashes, ulcers, or changes in pigmentation may indicate the cancer has spread or is progressing. Recognising these skin symptoms early can be crucial for timely diagnosis and treatment, improving outcomes for those affected by this disease.How colon cancer can affect the skinColon cancer originates in the colon lining but can spread beyond the primary site. In advanced stages, cancer cells may metastasise (spread) to other parts of the body, including the skin. Skin symptoms related to colon cancer may be due to:Direct metastasis to the skinParaneoplastic syndromes (indirect effects of cancer through immune or hormonal responses)Side effects of cancer treatmentsCommon skin symptoms linked to colon cancerAccording to a study published in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), skin manifestations in colon cancer patients, such as nodules and rashes, often indicate metastatic spread and can serve as important clinical signs for early diagnosis and treatment planning. Recognising these symptoms promptly may improve patient outcomes by facilitating timely intervention.1. Skin nodules or lesionsOne of the most recognised skin symptoms of colon cancer metastasis is the appearance of firm, painless nodules or lumps on the skin. These lesions can vary in colour, often reddish, purple, or skin-toned, and may appear anywhere but are frequently found on the abdomen, chest, or around surgical scars.2. Skin rash or erythemaIn some cases, colon cancer may trigger a rash or persistent redness known as erythema. This can be due to paraneoplastic syndromes, where the immune system reacts abnormally to the presence of cancer.3. Skin ulcers and infectionsCancerous lesions on the skin can break down, forming ulcers or open sores that are slow to heal. These can become sites of secondary infection, causing pain and discomfort.4. Hyperpigmentation and other changesRarely, patients may experience changes in skin colour or texture, including darkening (hyperpigmentation) or thickening of the skin.Why do skin symptoms occurMetastasis: Colon cancer cells travel through the bloodstream or lymphatic system and settle in the skin, forming secondary tumours.Immune response: The body’s reaction to the cancer can produce paraneoplastic skin conditions.Treatment effects: Chemotherapy and radiotherapy can cause skin dryness, rashes, and sensitivity.According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, cutaneous metastases from colon cancer occur in approximately 3-6% of patients, indicating a poor prognosis but providing important clinical clues.When to see a doctorIf you notice unusual skin changes such as persistent lumps, sores that don’t heal, or unexplained rashes, especially if you have a history of colon cancer or related symptoms (e.g., changes in bowel habits, abdominal pain, unexplained weight loss), it is essential to consult a healthcare professional promptly.Early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes.Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Waking up at 5:30/6:00am to move my body when my bed was so hard, because that’s when the sleep was sweetest, But those early workouts gave me consistency and discipline, especially with staying committed to my required daily calorie deficit meal plan. Exercising early gave me an automatic energy boost to start my day right."4/11Intermittent fasting"I constantly made sure and was intentional with intermittent fasting detoxing 2-3 days a week, even on days I did not feel like , I made a rule to always include 2-3 days fruit/detox fast, this helped with snatching my waist line."5/11No to "night" outs"My friends didn’t always get it, but I knew my future self would thank me, and it will be all worth it and the end, and Yes it helped me from the endless cycle of having to restart my journey after overindulging whenever I went out. Staying inside helped me save my money and also lose more weight easily."6/11Need over want"This is a hard decision but I noticed, if I wait until I was really hungry before I had something to eat, I always end up over-Eating or excessively snacking later during the day, so I made a decision to eat when it’s my time to eat and not to keep pushing until I’m hungry and this helped eliminate cravings and I was always constantly satisfied with my daily meal portion, I stayed in a calorie deficit easily, and this is important to see results.”7/11Mental struggles“I learnt the hard way that losing weight is more mental than physical. The hardest part wasn’t my body, it was my mind telling me to quit. I had to fight the voice that said “It’s not worth it” and keep going anyway, I had to constantly remind myself that this is beyond weight loss, it's about a lifestyle change, maintaining a healthy body and breaking out of endless procrastination,” she said.8/11Consistency“Rain, cramps, bad mood, a bad day, and even on days when they scale decided to misbehave, I still showed up, even if it’s not 100 percent, because I know what matters is consistency, and to be honest, motivation didn’t get me results, discipline did.”9/11Patience“I’ll keep reminding myself that some weeks, my weight didn’t move at all, and I know it will hurt, but I’ll try my best to keep up showing up and pushing, trusting the process instead of letting frustration win and focusing on other ways of measuring my progress, like taking pictures and retaking my measurements,” she added.10/11Track, track and trackAmaka said tracking was annoying and time-consuming at first, 'but knowing exactly what went into her body kept her from lying to herself about my habits and food portions and helped her stay more on track'.11/11Divine intervention“This was less of a sacrifice. I constantly asked for help and strength from God daily to keep pushing, and he really failed me, because daily my strength failed me. He came through for me above my expectations, continuously renewed my strength, took control over my sugar cravings and blessed my hard work with amazing results.”These views are not generic in nature.

Rosemary plant: How to spot the real one from look-alikes
Rosemary, a fragrant herb, is often mistaken for other plants like Russian sage and lavender. Identifying real rosemary involves checking for needle-like leaves with a silvery underside, a piney scent, and  small blue flowers. Using the correct rosemary is crucial for cooking, as imposters can ruin the flavor of dishes.

Identifying real rosemary involves checking for needle-like leaves with a silvery underside, a piney scent, and  small blue flowers. Using the correct rosemary is crucial for cooking, as imposters can ruin the flavor of dishes.  If you’ve ever been at a farmers’ market, garden centre, or even your aunt’s backyard, you’ve probably seen what looks like rosemary. But here’s the thing, Mother Nature likes to play tricks. Several plants look suspiciously like rosemary, and unless you know what you’re looking for, you could end up sniffing (or cooking with) the wrong herb.Step one: Get to know the shape and sizeReal rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) is a woody perennial herb that looks like a tiny pine tree got a haircut. Its leaves are needle-like but not sharp, and they grow in dense clusters along upright, woody stems.Height: Usually 1–3 feet when grown in pots, but in the ground it can get up to 4–5 feet tall.Stems: Woody at the base, greener near the tips.Leaves: Narrow, about an inch long, dark green on top, with a silvery-white underside.If the plant in question has floppy stems, rounded leaves, or bright green all the way through, it’s probably not rosemary.Step two: Trust your noseThis is the giveaway. Rosemary smells… well, like rosemary: strong, fresh, piney, with a hint of lemon and camphor. It’s unmistakable once you’ve sniffed the real thing.A quick tip: rub the leaves gently between your fingers. If the scent doesn’t explode into that classic rosemary aroma, you’re holding an imposter.Plants that often get mistaken for rosemary—like Russian sage or lavender—smell different. Russian sage has a softer, more sage-like aroma. Lavender, of course, smells floral, not savory.Step three: Check the color contrastOne of rosemary’s unique features is that two-tone leaf. The top side is dark, almost forest green, while the underside is pale and silvery, thanks to tiny hairs. This contrast is much more pronounced in rosemary than in most look-alike plants.If your “rosemary” has leaves that are the exact same shade on both sides—proceed with suspicion.Step four: Notice the flowers (if it’s blooming)Rosemary flowers are small, delicate, and usually pale blue to purple. They pop up in late winter or spring (though some varieties flower more than once a year).Impostors like lavender have much bigger, more fragrant blooms, while Russian sage has taller, airy flower spikes.Common Rosemary impostors and how to bust themLet’s play plant detective and meet rosemary’s top look-alikes.Russian Sage (Perovskia atriplicifolia)Taller, with softer, more feathery leaves.Light purple flowers in tall spikes.Smells herby but not piney.Lavender (Lavandula spp.)Leaves are often more grey-green and softer.Strong floral aroma (amazing, but definitely not rosemary).Taller flower stalks.Bog Sage (Salvia uliginosa)Bright blue flowers.More upright and less woody.Mild scent.Bonus tips for buying the right rosemaryIf you’re buying fresh rosemary sprigs in the supermarket or farmers’ market in the US look for:Firm, upright stems (not floppy).Strong fragrance.No yellowing or dried-out tips.If you’re buying a potted rosemary plant for your garden or windowsill:Check the label for Rosmarinus officinalis.Avoid plants that look leggy or sparse, they might be stressed or mislabeled.Give the leaves a sniff before you hand over your cash. Why you really want the real thingBesides the fact that fake rosemary just won’t taste right, rosemary has unique oils, like cineole and camphor, that give it its distinctive flavor and potential health benefits. It’s brilliant for seasoning roasted potatoes, chicken, lamb, bread, and even cocktails.If you mistakenly grab Russian sage, your potatoes will taste… well, earthy and weird. And lavender? Let’s just say your lamb chops will taste like soap.Spotting the right rosemary isn’t rocket science, it’s all about looking closely, smelling deeply, and trusting your senses. Once you’ve locked in that scent and leaf pattern, you’ll never be fooled again.So next time you’re at the garden center, channel your inner herb detective.Disclaimer: This content is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional botanical advice.

For individuals managing type 2 diabetes, maintaining stable blood sugar is crucial. Everyday Health reports that seemingly harmless habits can unexpectedly raise glucose levels.

Everyday Health reports that seemingly harmless habits can unexpectedly raise glucose levels. Skipping breakfast, hormonal changes, inactivity, stress, infections, certain medications, poor sleep, and gum disease are key culprits. Monitoring blood glucose alongside daily activities helps identify triggers, enabling better management and reducing diabetes-related complications.  Managing blood sugar levels is vital for living well with type 2 diabetes. While diet and medication are key, everyday habits can also significantly impact blood glucose control. Factors such as stress, sleep quality, physical activity, and even oral health can cause unexpected blood sugar spikes. These hidden triggers may disrupt your efforts, even when you’re following your treatment plan carefully. By understanding how these daily habits affect blood sugar, you can make smarter choices to improve control, reduce fluctuations, and lower the risk of diabetes-related complications over time. Awareness is the first step to better management.8 surprising causes of high blood sugarAccording to Everyday Health, these everyday habits could unexpectedly increase your blood sugar levels and affect diabetes management.1. Skipping breakfastMissing breakfast may seem harmless, but for people with type 2 diabetes, it can cause blood sugar levels to remain elevated throughout the day. Skipping this important meal may impair the function of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, making it harder to regulate glucose after subsequent meals.2. Hormonal changes during menstruationFor women, hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle can lead to noticeable blood sugar swings. Increased levels of oestrogen and progesterone around ovulation and just before the period can make blood sugar harder to manage. Tracking your cycle alongside your blood glucose readings can help anticipate these changes and adjust treatment accordingly.3. Physical inactivityRegular exercise enhances insulin sensitivity and helps cells absorb glucose for energy. Conversely, even a few days of reduced physical activity can cause blood sugar levels to rise. Incorporating consistent movement into your routine is key for maintaining good glucose control and reducing reliance on medications.4. Stress and cortisolStress triggers the release of cortisol, a hormone that can increase blood sugar by reducing insulin sensitivity. Both mental and physical stressors, such as work pressure, relationship issues, or injury, can cause unexpected spikes in glucose. Learning stress management techniques like deep breathing or short walks can help mitigate these effects.5. Infections and illnessWhen your body fights infection, it produces stress hormones that can raise blood sugar levels. This inflammatory response makes it harder to keep glucose in check, which is why sick days require special attention. Discuss with your healthcare provider how to monitor and manage your blood sugar during illness.6. Certain medications and supplementsVarious prescribed drugs and over-the-counter supplements can influence blood sugar. Always inform your doctor about any new medications or supplements to assess their potential impact on your diabetes management.7. Poor sleep qualityLack of sufficient sleep is linked to elevated stress hormones and reduced insulin production. Sleep deprivation can also increase hunger hormones, making dietary control more challenging. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep nightly to support stable blood sugar levels.8. Gum disease and oral healthEmerging research highlights a two-way relationship between diabetes and gum disease. Poor dental health can increase systemic inflammation and infections, which in turn raise blood sugar levels. Good oral hygiene and regular dental visits are especially important for people managing type 2 diabetes.Managing unexpected blood sugar spikesAwareness is the first step to preventing unexpected blood sugar increases. Keep a detailed log of your blood glucose readings along with notes on your activities, stress levels, sleep patterns, and medication changes. This information can help your healthcare team identify triggers and adjust your treatment plan effectively.Also read | How gout increases your risk of developing type 2 diabetes: Know the link between the twoAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Iceland leads as the safest, followed by Ireland and Denmark, according to the Global Peace Index. These nations, along with Austria and Portugal, offer travelers peace of mind amidst cultural heritage and natural landscapes. 12 That Europe trip that most of us have bookmarked and daydreamed about for ages? And if safety has been one of your concerns that has made you push back your plans, it’s time to put those worries at rest. You can say hello to peace of mind on your next trip! From Iceland’s glacier-kissed calm to Portugal’s sun-soaked streets, Europe’s safest countries serve up scenic views with zero stress. (Data sourced from Data Pandas)Safety isn’t just about locking doors or avoiding sketchy alleyways,it’s a lifestyle, a mood, and indeed matters wherever you are, especially when you are travelling. As such, the Global Peace Index (GPI), compiled by the Institute for Economics & Peace, ranks countries based on three pillars: societal safety and security, ongoing domestic and international conflicts, and the level of militarisation, can serve as a point of reference when planning that long-awaited trip. Read on to find the safest places on the list.Topping Europe’s safest list is Iceland, scoring 1.107, and that is because of Iceland’s longstanding stability, minimal crime rates, and cohesive society make it a haven for peace seekers.Next up is Ireland with a score of 1.288, where cordial international relations and progressive policies help the Emerald Isle maintain its low-crime, high-peace reputation. Then come the usual suspects for Nordic serenity: Denmark (1.296), Austria (1.300), and Portugal (1.301). If you like your peace served with scenic fjords or sunlit coastlines, these countries check all the boxes.Read more: How to see incredible India i just 2 weeksRounding out the top ten are Slovenia (1.316) and the Czech Republic (1.318)—perfect blends of cultural heritage, modern governance, and safe streets. Switzerland isn’t far behind at 1.357, living up to its “politically stable and secure” reputation. Hungary (1.411) and Finland (1.439) complete the top ten, showing that both Central Europe and the Nordic north have mastered the art of peace.Patterns and trendsA clear trend emerges: Western Europe and Nordic nations dominate the safety charts, consistently scoring high on GPI, thanks to strong institutions, social trust, and political stability. Meanwhile, Eastern European and Eurasian countries tend to occupy the lower rungs, reflecting regional disparities in security and conflict levels. Notably, countries like Ukraine (2.971) and Russia (3.275) scored significantly lower, highlighting heightened instability relative to their western neighbors.Read more: Temples, Taj, and Thar: An epic 15-day adventure in the heart of North IndiaThis geographic divergence paints a picture of Europe as a continent of contrasts: idyllic, safe havens in the west and north, coupled with regions still grappling with security challenges in the east.These safety scores aren’t just numbers, they’re travel guides, lifestyle indicators, and sometimes, reassurance that your dream European adventure won’t require constant vigilance. If your plan includes strolling cobbled streets in Iceland, sipping espresso in Austria, or hiking Portuguese hills without a care, the GPI rankings suggest you’re in for a calm, worry-free experience.From Iceland’s glacial calm to Finland’s northern tranquility, Europe offers a spectrum of safe havens where peace is more than a concept, it’s a lived reality. Whether you’re planning a vacation, considering relocation, or just daydreaming from your couch, these countries make the case that a good life is often the safest life.Top 25 of Europe’s Safest Countries (GPI 2025)Iceland – 1.095Ireland – 1.26Switzerland – 1.294Austria – 1.294Portugal – 1.371Denmark – 1.393Slovenia – 1.409Finland – 1.42Czech Republic – 1.435Netherlands – 1.491Belgium – 1.492Hungary – 1.5Croatia – 1.519Germany – 1.533Latvia – 1.558Lithuania – 1.558Estonia – 1.559Spain – 1.578Slovakia – 1.609Bulgaria – 1.61United Kingdom – 1.634Norway – 1.644Italy – 1.662Montenegro – 1.685Sweden – 1.709Source: Institute for Economics & Peace, Global Peace Index 2025.About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Potassium-rich foods to lower blood pressure: Bananas and broccoli explained
Research indicates that increasing potassium intake through foods like bananas and sweet potatoes can significantly lower blood pressure, potentially more effectively than solely reducing sodium. The study emphasizes the importance of the potassium-to-sodium ratio for vascular health, suggesting that incorporating potassium-rich foods into diets can improve cardiovascular health, especially for men.

The study emphasizes the importance of the potassium-to-sodium ratio for vascular health, suggesting that incorporating potassium-rich foods into diets can improve cardiovascular health, especially for men.  High blood pressure is one of the most common health concerns worldwide, yet many people focus only on cutting salt to manage it. While reducing sodium can help, it is not the only or even the most effective way to bring blood pressure down. New research from the University of Waterloo suggests that increasing potassium intake through foods such as bananas, sweet potatoes, spinach and broccoli could have an even greater impact.In a study published in the American Journal of Physiology – Renal Physiology, researchers led by Anita Layton used a detailed mathematical model to examine how dietary changes affect blood pressure regulation. They found that raising the potassium-to-sodium ratio consistently lowered blood pressure, even when salt levels stayed the same. The effect was particularly strong in men, who showed greater improvement from higher potassium intake compared to women. High blood pressure affects more than 30 percent of adults worldwide and increases the risk of heart disease, stroke and kidney problems. This research offers a simple, accessible and science-backed approach for prevention. Rather than focusing only on reducing sodium, adding more potassium-rich foods to daily meals could become a key part of heart-healthy diets. Experts believe this shift in focus from restriction to nutrient balance could help improve cardiovascular health for millions of people.How potassium-rich foods help lower blood pressure naturallyPotassium plays a vital role in regulating blood pressure by helping the kidneys flush out excess sodium through urine. This action reduces fluid retention, which in turn eases the strain on blood vessel walls and allows the heart to pump more efficiently. Over time, this can significantly lower the risk of hypertension-related complications such as stroke, heart attack and kidney damage. The University of Waterloo researchers found that even without lowering salt intake, boosting potassium intake led to marked improvements in cardiovascular health markers. Men, in particular, showed stronger benefits from higher potassium consumption compared to women. This indicates that potassium has a blood pressure–lowering effect that works independently of sodium restriction.These results highlight how simple dietary changes, such as adding more potassium-rich foods like bananas, spinach, lentils and sweet potatoes, can be an easy yet powerful strategy for improving heart health. For millions of people living with or at risk of high blood pressure, focusing on nutrient balance rather than strict salt reduction may offer a more sustainable and effective path to long-term wellnessWhy bananas and broccoli are top potassium-rich foods for heart healthBananas and broccoli stand out as potassium-rich foods because they are widely available, affordable and versatile enough to fit into almost any diet. A medium banana contains about 422 milligrams of potassium, while a cup of cooked broccoli offers around 457 milligrams. These amounts contribute meaningfully toward the daily recommended intake, making them practical choices for supporting blood pressure regulation. Beyond potassium, bananas supply natural sugars for quick energy, dietary fiber for better digestion and vitamin B6 for nerve and metabolic health.Broccoli brings its own powerful mix of nutrients, including vitamin C for immune support, vitamin K for blood clotting and bone strength, and antioxidants that protect cells from damage. Together, they provide a nutrient-dense combination that benefits heart health, supports healthy circulation and promotes overall wellness. Whether blended into smoothies, tossed into salads, steamed as a side dish or eaten as a quick snack, adding bananas and broccoli to your daily routine is a simple step with long-term cardiovascular benefits.Potassium-to-sodium ratio: The key to controlling blood pressureThe study highlighted that it is the balance between potassium and sodium that matters most, rather than focusing solely on cutting salt. Maintaining an ideal potassium-to-sodium ratio supports vascular health, helps keep arteries flexible, and lowers the risk of hypertension. This nutrient balance improves blood flow and reduces strain on the heart over time.Researchers noted that this approach could be especially valuable in populations where salt consumption is high but potassium intake remains low, a pattern common in many parts of the world. By encouraging the inclusion of more potassium-rich foods rather than relying only on sodium restriction, public health programmes could offer a simpler and more sustainable way to reduce cardiovascular risk on a large scale.Practical tips to increase potassium-rich foods in your dietAdd sliced bananas to breakfast cereals or smoothies.Steam or stir-fry broccoli as a side dish for lunch or dinner.Include other potassium sources like spinach, lentils, and sweet potatoes.Balance high-potassium foods with moderate salt use for the best results.While reducing salt remains beneficial for heart health, the new findings suggest that increasing potassium-rich foods could have an even greater effect on lowering blood pressure. For most people, this does not require drastic or restrictive diets. Instead, it can be achieved through small, consistent changes such as adding bananas to breakfast, including leafy greens in lunch or dinner, and choosing beans or lentils as a regular protein source.These adjustments not only support healthy blood pressure but also provide a range of other nutrients that benefit overall wellbeing. By focusing on what to add rather than only on what to cut, people can improve heart health without sacrificing flavour or variety in their meals.Also read| Can your daily cup of coffee or tea boost your mood?

Cardiovascular diseases claim millions of lives annually, highlighting the importance of heart health. Incorporating leafy greens rich in Vitamin K, whole grains high in fiber, and berries abundant in flavonoids can significantly improve cardiovascular function. Avocados, packed with monounsaturated fats, and fatty fish containing omega-3 acids also contribute to a healthier heart. About 17.9 million die each year due to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) every year. CVDs are the leading cause of death globally, according to the WHO. Maintaining heart health is crucial, and diet plays a pivotal role in it. Here is a list of foods that can improve your heart health. Leafy greensEat your greens. Yes, that's right. Leafy greens such as spinach, kale, and Swiss chard are nutritional powerhouses. They are an excellent source of vitamin K, which helps protect arteries and promote proper blood clotting. A recent study from Edith Cowan University (ECU), the University of Western Australia, and the Danish Cancer Institute has shown that a cup and a half of leafy green vegetables could go a long way to addressing atherosclerotic vascular diseases (ASVD’s). The study found that higher dietary intake of Vitamin K1 can reduce the risk of ASVD. “Leafy green and cruciferous vegetables, like spinach, kale, and broccoli, contain Vitamin K,1 which may assist in preventing vascular calcification processes that characterise cardiovascular disease. The great news is that these vegetables can be easily incorporated into your daily meals,” the lead researcher said. Whole grainsRefined grains are your heart's biggest enemy. Instead, switch to whole grains, such as oats, quinoa, brown rice, and whole wheat. They are high in fiber, which helps reduce cholesterol and maintain healthy blood sugar levels. A 2021 study showed that eating more refined grains increases the risk of major cardiovascular disease, such as heart attack, stroke, and even death. Whole grains, on the other hand, are linked to a lower risk of heart disease.PollWhich food do you believe is the most beneficial for heart health?Leafy greensBerriesBerriesWho knew eating something as sumptuous as berries could actually boost your heart health! These include blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries. They contain flavonoids, which can lower blood pressure and reduce oxidative stress. A 2019 study by researchers at the University of East Anglia found that eating a cup of blueberries a day reduces risk factors for cardiovascular disease."Previous studies have indicated that people who regularly eat blueberries have a reduced risk of developing conditions, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This may be because blueberries are high in naturally occurring compounds called anthocyanins, which are the flavonoids responsible for the red and blue colour in fruits. We found that eating one cup of blueberries per day resulted in sustained improvements in vascular function and arterial stiffness - making enough of a difference to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by between 12 and 15 per cent," the researchers of the study said.AvocadosYes, the creamy green fruit can not only bless your taste buds, but also boost your heart health. They are rich in monounsaturated fats, which can help lower 'bad' LDL cholesterol and increase 'good' HDL cholesterol. A 2022 study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that eating two or more servings of avocado weekly was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. The participants in the study, who ate at least two servings of avocado each week, had a 16% lower risk of cardiovascular disease and a 21% lower risk of coronary heart disease, compared to those who never or rarely ate avocado.Diet to reduce body inflammation: Foods that help reduce inflammation.Fatty fishAnother way to enhance your heart health is to add more fatty fish to your diet. Fatty fish, such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, and trout, are rich in omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which have been shown to reduce inflammation and improve overall heart health. A 2023 study by researchers from Karolinska Institute found that the risk of CVDs can be reduced by eating more fatty fish. People with close relatives who have suffered from cardiovascular disease may also benefit from eating more oily fish."Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

People who live past 100 have one thing in common, finds study
A Swedish study tracking older adults reveals that specific blood markers, related to metabolism, inflammation, and organ function, correlate with exceptional longevity. Future centenarians often exhibited healthier, balanced readings in their 60s, suggesting these biomarkers can predict who might live past 100. Maintaining these markers within healthy ranges through lifestyle and monitoring may improve long-term survival prospects.

Future centenarians often exhibited healthier, balanced readings in their 60s, suggesting these biomarkers can predict who might live past 100. Maintaining these markers within healthy ranges through lifestyle and monitoring may improve long-term survival prospects.  What makes some people live to see a full century while others don’t? According to a Swedish study published in GeroScience by researchers from the Karolinska Institute, a surprisingly simple clue may lie within the body, distinguishing future centenarians from the rest of the population. Researchers tracked tens of thousands of older adults over several decades, observing patterns that hinted at exceptional longevity long before participants reached 100. While genetics, diet, exercise, and lifestyle factors continue to influence lifespan, the study found a consistent pattern in certain blood markers that strongly correlated with living past a century. These findings offer an intriguing glimpse into the biological secrets behind extraordinary longevity and could help guide future research on healthy aging.Key biomarkers linked to living past 100 The study analysed twelve blood markers connected to metabolism, inflammation, kidney and liver function, malnutrition, and anaemia. Researchers found that people who eventually reached 100 tended to have healthier, more balanced readings even in their 60s, suggesting that these biomarkers can provide early signals of exceptional longevity.Lower levels observed in future centenarians included:Glucose (blood sugar)Creatinine (kidney function)Uric acid (inflammation)AST/ALT (liver enzymes)Alkaline phosphatase (liver and bone health)Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, tissue damage)Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC, nutrition status)Higher levels observed included:IronTotal cholesterolResearchers noted that the readings of future centenarians were rarely extreme. Instead, most had moderate, stable values, highlighting that a balance in these biomarkers, rather than unusually high or low figures, may be key to longevity. Interestingly, these patterns were remarkably consistent across individuals, suggesting a common physiological profile among those who achieve exceptional age.The findings also suggest that maintaining these markers within healthy ranges may reflect both genetic advantages and lifestyle factors, such as a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and effective management of chronic health conditions. This early physiological advantage, evident even decades before reaching 100, underscores the importance of midlife health as a foundation for long-term survival.How these markers can predict longevityAll but two of the twelve biomarkers were found to have predictive power for reaching 100. Low iron or very low cholesterol appeared to reduce the likelihood, while stable kidney and liver markers, low uric acid, and low-normal blood glucose were strong indicators of longevity. Subtle differences in these measurements were often evident decades before the 100th birthday, highlighting the value of routine blood tests as a tool for assessing long-term survival prospects.Health and lifestyle in the journey to 100Many future centenarians already displayed fewer chronic conditions and healthier overall profiles by their 60s. This suggests that both genetics and lifestyle factors—such as diet, exercise, and preventive healthcare—play important roles. Women represented roughly 85% of those who reached 100, reflecting broader global longevity trends. The combination of healthy blood markers and fewer health issues in midlife appears to set the stage for exceptional longevity.What it means for the rest of usThe study’s findings hint at a practical takeaway: monitoring and managing key physiological markers can offer insight into long-term survival prospects. Paying attention to glucose, cholesterol, iron, inflammation, and kidney and liver health—even later in life—may improve the odds of reaching a century. While genetics still matters, lifestyle and regular health monitoring appear to provide a real opportunity to influence how long and how well we live.About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

The body experiences this condition when it either fails to produce adequate insulin, or loses its ability to use insulin effectively. (Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps regulate blood sugar levels by allowing glucose to enter cells for energy) In most cases, Diabetes is usually not reversible, but it can be managed with a healthy diet, and medication. Both men and women can get Diabetes at any point in their lives, but the symptoms might be slightly different. Here are some early signs of Diabetes in men (however, these are not exclusive to the condition, and only a blood test can confirm the same)2/613/6234/6Erectile dysfunction and low testosteroneDiabetes creates specific sexual health complications which affect men. Erectile dysfunction is a typical symptom, which causes difficulties with achieving or sustaining an erection. The onset of erectile dysfunction occurs earlier in diabetic men compared to non-diabetic men. The condition develops because elevated blood sugar levels injure nerves along with blood vessels, which maintain normal sexual operations. Men who have diabetes face an elevated probability of developing low testosterone, which healthcare providers refer to as low-T. Decreased sex drive together with depression symptoms and muscle strength reduction are possible consequences of low testosterone levels in men. Retrograde ejaculation represents another possible condition, where semen enters the bladder instead of passing through the penis during ejaculation. These health issues stem from diabetes effects on hormone levels and nerve system health in men.5/6Slow-healing wounds and frequent infectionsDiabetes causes the immune system to slow down, thus making wounds and cuts heal at a slower rate. Men who have diabetes notice that their small cuts, infections and scrapes, require longer periods to heal than normal. The risk of developing serious or infected wounds becomes higher because of these factors. The symptoms of repeated infections include both urinary tract infections and fungal infections, that present as genital thrush. Yeast infections of private areas is also common, because the high sugar content in urine creates an ideal environment for yeast to multiply. The affected areas typically show redness alongside swelling and itchiness, along with white lumps on the skin surface.6/6Blurred vision and numbnessVision changes constitute a common symptom which diabetic men typically experience. Men with diabetes often experience fluid movement in their eyes, that distorts their lenses, thus producing blurry vision. The condition of diabetic retinopathy develops from blurred vision through extended exposure to high blood sugar levels. This also produces numbness, along with tingling sensations in the feet and hands of diabetic men. The body develops nerve damage from prolonged exposure to high blood sugar levels. The initial mild sensations from these symptoms can transform into severe discomfort before causing complete numbness. The symptoms of blurred vision and numbness indicate diabetes-related nerve and organ damage, which requires prompt medical care for proper management and prevention of additional damage.Sources:https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_symptoms_in_men/article.htmhttps://www.lybrate.com/topic/diabeteshttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/311173https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/understanding-diabetes-symptomshttps://www.nhs.uk/conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms/https://www.healthline.com/health/diabeteshttps://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/signs-symptoms/index.htmlDisclaimer: This article is informational only and not a substitute for medical adviceFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous9 gut-friendly drinks for the changing seasonFood​Jyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunning​indiaCelebrating 79th Independence Day: 10 slogans that inspired India’s freedom movement​indiaGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalindiaIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiindiaAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameindiaLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietindiaBirthday Special: Spine-chilling quotes of Alfred Hitchcock that will keep you up at nightindia10 baby names that mean creativity and visionindia Next123 Photostories  Cardiologist says these blood tests that can predict heart disease risks even before symptoms appearSachin Tendulkar’s son Arjun Tendulkar gets engaged to Saaniya Chandok: All about the couple’s family background and educational qualificationsTemples, Taj, and Thar: An epic 15-day adventure in the heart of North IndiaFrom bullied schoolboy to ₹3,000 crore superstar – Hrithik Roshan’s inspiring journeyThis is how cooking meat may increase the risk of cancerHow to see incredible India in just two weeksSeeds that supercharge muscle growth and overall healthNAFLD in kids: Harvard-trained doctor explains why this silent liver disease is on the riseFrom Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leaves123lifestyle videos13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement16:34Life After 60: Why India's seniors are choosing community living04:34Control Your Senses, Gain Knowledge, Attain Peace: Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4.3906:37Cultural Clashes in Love: How To Make Your Relationship Work03:19Prayagraj MahaKumbh 2025 Readies For Millions: Massive Preparations Underway In Uttar Pradesh04:48Sadhguru Reveals The Truth About Black Magic And Your Photograph07:18BK Shivani On Forgiveness: Why It’s Essential For Inner Peace08:08How Bhairavi Sadhana Accelerates Your Path to Liberation: Sadhguru Speaks06:47Breakup Recovery: How To Not Wallow In Misery And Love Yourself03:20The Purifying Power of Yajna: Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4, Verse 3011:41How Dattatreya Accepted Parashuram as His Disciple – Sadhguru Reveals03:54Can Water Remember?

Learn how to easily make dhaniya water at home and incorporate it into your routine for a natural, budget-friendly way to achieve luscious locks. Okay, picture this: you’re chopping coriander for your tadka, and your mum or dadi casually says, “Put some on your hair, it’s good for growth.” You roll your eyes because… how can pudina’s less glamorous cousin make your hair grow? Well, turns out, she was right all along.Yes, the same humble bunch of dhaniya you use for chutneys is basically a growth serum in disguise. Cheap, easy, natural and no, it won’t make your head smell like sambar.Why dhaniya deserves a spot in your hair routineLet’s give credit where it’s due. Dhaniya leaves are like a little green powerhouse. They’re loaded with Vitamin C, Vitamin K, iron, and antioxidants. Translation: they feed your hair follicles, improve blood flow to the scalp, and keep hair from falling out like autumn leaves.Plus, it’s one of those “kitchen to beauty shelf” hacks that’s been passed down generations. No chemicals, no fancy packaging, just pure, old-school magic.The easiest way to make dhaniya waterAlright, here’s the lazy-girl recipe.You will need:1 cup fresh coriander leaves (don’t be stingy, more leaves = more power)2–3 cups waterOptional: a few drops of coconut or castor oil if you want some extra oomphMethod:Wash the leaves properly because no one wants scalp dirt.Roughly chop them and throw them in a blender with 1 cup of water.Blend into a green paste - yes, it will look like chutney.Strain it with a fine sieve or cloth.Add the remaining water to dilute it.Boom. Your hair tonic is ready. Bonus points if you pour it into a spray bottle because it makes you feel like a fancy influencer.How to use it without making a messIf you think you can just pour it over your head and be done - nope. There’s a little art to it.Start clean - Shampoo first so your scalp is free from oil and gunk.Section your hair - Otherwise, you’ll miss half your scalp.Massage like you mean it - Pour/spray the dhaniya water and give yourself a nice scalp massage for 5–7 minutes. Feels heavenly.Wrap it up - Cover with a shower cap and chill for 30–45 minutes. Perfect time for scrolling Insta or stalking your ex’s new haircut.Rinse off - Use water or a mild shampoo to wash it out. If you added oil, shampoo twice.How often to use itTwo times a week is your sweet spot. Stick with it for a month and you’ll see less hair in your comb. Two to three months in, you might spot those cute baby hairs growing along your hairline.Remember, natural stuff takes time, this isn’t a “Rapunzel in 7 days” situation.Want to amp it up?Mix dhaniya water with:Aloe vera gel for extra moistureFenugreek water for dandruff dramaLemon juice if your scalp gets oily fastYou can even mix the coriander paste directly into coconut oil, massage it in, and leave it overnight if you want to go full TLC mode.Little things to keep in mindAlways do a patch test. Rare, but some people can react to coriander.Use fresh leaves, not dried coriander powder (your scalp is not a curry).Be consistent. Missing weeks will just take you back to square one.Why it’s totally worth the effortHonestly? In a world of hair products that cost more than rent, it feels good to go old-school. Dhaniya water not only helps with growth, it makes your hair shinier, softer, and stronger.Plus, there’s this smug joy when someone says, “Your hair looks amazing” and you go, “Oh thanks, it’s just coriander water.” Watch their face. Priceless.Next time you grab a bunch of dhaniya from the sabziwala, keep some aside for your hair. It’s budget-friendly, low-effort, and actually works. And who knows - in a few months, you might just have the thick, swishy hair you keep saving on Pinterest.About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

A recent study reveals that engaging in acts of kindness can significantly slow cognitive decline. Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Massachusetts Boston found that regular volunteering or helping others reduces cognitive aging by 15-20%. As you age, your brain tends to slow down. This makes simple everyday tasks, such as problem-solving, focus, and memory, a challenge. So, can you prevent cognitive decline? Or slow it down? Well, according to science, yes, it's possible. You can slow down cognitive decline. No, you don’t have to spend on expensive supplements or treatments to achieve it. In fact, it requires almost no money at all. A new study has found that a simple daily act can slow down cognitive decline. A new study led by the researchers at the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Massachusetts Boston has found that cognitive decline can be reduced by about 20% by a simple act of kindness. The findings of the study are published in the journal Social Science & Medicine. Helping others can reduce the rate of cognitive declineThe latest evidence shows that meaningful social connections improve health. The researchers found that helping others outside the home regularly can significantly slow cognitive decline in middle-aged and older adults. They noticed that regular volunteering can reduce the rate of cognitive aging by 15-20%.PollWhich type of helping do you think has more cognitive benefits?YesNoThe study involved more than 30,000 adults from the US over two decades. They found that the cognitive decline linked with aging dropped by 15-20% in people who formally volunteer their services or help in more informal ways with neighbors, family, or friends outside the home regularly. They noticed an improved cognitive function in those who set aside about two to four hours per week to helping others.“Everyday acts of support, whether organized or personal, can have lasting cognitive impact. What stood out to me was that the cognitive benefits of helping others weren’t just short-term boosts but cumulative over time with sustained engagement, and these benefits were evident for both formal volunteering and informal helping. And in addition to that, moderate engagement of just two to four hours was consistently linked to robust benefits,” Sae Hwang Han, an assistant professor of human development and family sciences at UT, who led the study, said in a statement. Helping rewards the brain Any act of helping or volunteering in either formal or informal ways, such as assisting neighbors, relatives, or friends in need with things like getting to a health appointment, caring for children, lawn work, or preparing taxes, is associated with improved cognition. “Informal helping is sometimes assumed to offer fewer health benefits due to its lack of social recognition. It was a pleasant surprise to find that it provides cognitive benefits comparable to formal volunteering,” Han said.The researchers also found that people who make helping behaviors a part of their routine, year over year, have greater benefits.

This suggests the importance of keeping older adults engaged in some form of helping for as long as possible, with appropriate supports and accommodations in place,” Han said. This study further emphasizes the need to discuss volunteerism, helping, and strengthening neighborhood relations, particularly in later life when diseases associated with cognitive decline and impairment, like Alzheimer’s, tend to set in.Another study led by Han also found that volunteering buffered the adverse effects of chronic stress on systemic inflammation, a known biological pathway linked to cognitive decline and dementia. The effect was especially pronounced among people with higher levels of inflammation.“Many older adults in suboptimal health often continue to make valuable contributions to those around them, and they also may be the ones to especially benefit from being provided with opportunities to help,” Han said."Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Travel-related stress together with feelings of anxiety stemming from plan changes and new environment, causes bowel function to slow down  Have you ever noticed that when you are traveling, your bowel habits go for a toss, even if you never have the issue at home? Travelers commonly experience constipation, which doctors refer to as traveler's constipation. Your digestive system reacts differently to the changes in your daily routine when you travel, thus causing this condition. But how can we fix it? Let's dig deeper...What is traveler’s constipationWhen traveling, most people experience constipation which includes either difficult stool passage, or infrequent bowel movements. The regular bowel movements that people experience usually at home, become disrupted during their travel periods. When traveling, the digestive system operates at a reduced speed, to produce tough and dry stools that become difficult to pass through the body. Most individuals experience this condition temporarily for the first few days of travel, and then it resumes back to normal. However, the condition can result in discomfort and pain that needs proper management.Why does traveler’s constipation happenMultiple elements work together to create constipation issues among travelers. Just like our body, our bowels, too, need a routine. The disruption of daily routines, alters your body's natural circadian rhythm which controls both digestion and bowel movements. Your digestive system experiences disruption because you travel between time zones, and eat at irregular times, and sleep differently than usual.Another major factor is dehydration. Airplane cabins contain dry air, and travelers usually do not consume enough water during flight, or even on the go, while sightseeing. When people do not get enough fluids in their body, the stool turns hard, which makes it hard to pass through the digestive system.Other factorsDiet too, plays a huge role. During your travels, you probably consume more processed food and heavy meals, alongside fewer vegetables and less fiber than you normally would. A diet with insufficient fiber content, leads to delayed digestion which results in constipation.Your intestines need movement to function properly, but travelers spend most of their time inactive during flights and car rides which worsens this condition. Travel-related stress together with feelings of anxiety stemming from plan changes and new environment, causes bowel function to slow down.Symptoms of traveler’s constipationTravelers who experience constipation usually show these typical symptoms:Having fewer than three bowel movements per weekThe stool becomes extremely hard and dry, while causing discomfort or difficulties during bowel movements.Fullness or bloating after eating, or after visiting the bathroom.Straining or pain during bowel movements.The mentioned symptoms produce mild discomfort, but usually do not pose significant threats to health. Medical help should be sought when constipation continues beyond a normal period, or when accompanied by intense pain or bloody stools.How to fix traveler’s constipationHere are some ways to fix this condition:1. Throughout your entire trip, you should consume lots of water because it will make your stools softer. Consuming large amounts of caffeine and alcohol should be avoided, since they have a dehydrating effect.2. Your diet should contain fruits and vegetables, together with whole grains and legumes, as these foods are high in fiber. The fiber content in your diet creates volume in your stool, which leads to regular bowel movements.3. Light walking and other forms of physical exercise will help activate your digestive system to relieve constipation.4. The practice of relaxation techniques which includes deep breathing and meditation, will help you manage stress because it affects digestion.5. You should never delay passing stools because this behavior will worsen your constipation symptoms. You should stick to your regular bathroom schedule while traveling.After consulting your doctor, you can consume supplements or laxatives when traveling.SourcesWhen Travel Stops You Up | Needham Gastroenterology AssociatesWhy You Get Constipated While Traveling - Cleveland ClinicHow can a person manage and prevent travel constipation? - Medical News TodayTraveler's Constipation: A Prospective Cohort StudyDisclaimer: This article is informational only and not a substitute for medical advice"Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Fatty liver disease in kids: Why this silent liver disease is on the rise
Dr. Saurabh Sethi highlights the alarming rise of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in adolescents due to unhealthy diets. Consuming sugary foods like pastries and soft drinks leads to excess fructose conversion into liver fat, potentially causing NAFLD. Untreated NAFLD can progress to severe liver issues, including cirrhosis, possibly requiring a liver transplant.

Dr. Saurabh Sethi highlights the alarming rise of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in adolescents due to unhealthy diets. Consuming sugary foods like pastries and soft drinks leads to excess fructose conversion into liver fat, potentially causing NAFLD. Untreated NAFLD can progress to severe liver issues, including cirrhosis, possibly requiring a liver transplant. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasingly becoming common among adolescents and young adults. Modern lifestyle factors, including poor diet, sedentary habits, and obesity, are key drivers of this issue. Dr. Saurabh Sethi, a California-based gastroenterologist trained at Harvard and Stanford, has now shared the shocking information on how the incidence of NAFLD is rising among kids. Dr. Sethi has explained how diet plays a key role in increasing the risk of NAFLD in kids. What is NAFLDNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common condition where fat builds up in your liver. It affects people who consume little to no alcohol. NAFLD is often linked to being overweight and can usually be treated with healthy lifestyle changes. Also referred to as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), this is a silent disease with few or no symptoms. In some cases, people may not experience any symptoms even if they develop cirrhosis due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), also referred to as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH).What makes NAFLD even more dangerous is that if left untreated, it can progress to chronic conditions such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and even liver cancer. This, over time, may also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.What are the symptoms of NAFLDMost people with NAFLD do not show any symptoms. Some people do not realise they have the condition until they discover it in some other test.Some of the symptoms include:Chronic fatigueFeeling generally unwellLiver pain or discomfort in the upper right side of your abdomen, under the ribsWhat causes NAFLD in children Dr. Sethi revealed that an unhealthy diet is one of the biggest reasons why children develop this condition. He explained that feeding children sugary foods can lead to NAFLD. “Serving your kid sugary foods like pastries, soft drinks, or cookies can be harmful. Sugar is 50% glucose and 50% fructose. While glucose provides energy to the whole body, excess fructose is converted into fat in the liver, potentially leading to fatty liver,” he said, in a video shared on Instagram. Kiara Advani’s 'War 2' Diet Revealed: Protein Pancakes, Grilled Chicken & No 'Quick Fixes'The liver specialist also emphasized that leaving this condition untreated may even lead to the need for a liver transplant. “If untreated, it can progress to severe liver issues including cirrhosis, which may require a liver transplant in extreme cases,” the doctor said.How to preventThe best way to prevent NAFLD is to focus on the lifestyle factors that are in your control, such as diet and exercise Eat a healthy, balanced diet rich in whole grains, vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, healthy oils, and low-fat dairy products.Maintain a healthy weightExercise regularly If you are overweight, lose the extra pound.

When in Delhi, include Mughal forts, trendy cafés, and popular markets for sure. Then head to Agra for the must-do Taj Mahal visit that will make you feel like you are in a dream. Next up is Jaipur’s palaces, pink-hued streets, and auto-rickshaw rides that will make you believe in colour therapy.3/9Try overnight trainsWhy waste precious sightseeing hours? India’s overnight trains will be a surprising and effective time-saving hack, but only if you plan it well in advance, as getting confirmed tickets can be a task at times, depending on the destination you choose.  Book AC 2-tier for a comfy-ish sleep, and you’ll wake up in a whole new city.4/9Mix metro cities with small towns For maximum coverage, don’t just city-hop. Balance the bustle of Mumbai or Kolkata with quieter, character-packed towns. Like for example Pushkar’s camel markets, Hampi’s boulder-strewn ruins, or Puducherry’s pastel French quarters. India’s small towns are sometimes the most charming surprises that you might not have expected.5/9Pick your mountains or beaches (or you can do both)Two weeks means tough choices. If you crave crisp air and Himalayan views, head north to Manali or Rishikesh. If your idea of bliss involves coconut trees and lazy sunsets, Kerala’s backwaters and Goa’s beaches will deliver. Trying to do both might be a hectic schedule, which will be tempting but ill-advised.6/9Say yes to street food, but with cautionYou’re not truly seeing India until you’ve eaten something from a cart that’s been parked in the same spot since the ’80s. Delhi’s chaat, Kolkata’s kathi rolls, Mumbai’s vada pav, each is a flavour explosion.7/9Follow the art of half-dayForget “one day per city.” In India, a half-day can fit a sunrise temple visit, a chaotic market, a street food lunch, and still leave you time to catch a train. The trick? Early mornings and ruthless prioritising. Pick 2–3 must-sees if you want to cover more in less time.8/9Use domestic flightsIndia is huge. So, domestic flights should be your pick if you need to travel from Jaipur to Kochi or Varanasi to Goa without losing two days on the road. There are budget airlines, and you can score budget tickets if you book early.9/9End with a ‘slow day’Your last 24 hours shouldn’t be a mad dash. Pick one city to just be. Maybe it’s watching the Ganga aarti in Varanasi, drifting on a Kerala houseboat, or sipping chai on a Goan balcony. Let the noise fade, and let the country sink in. India isn’t just about what you see, it’s about how it lingers with you.Follow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous​Jyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunning​indiaCelebrating 79th Independence Day: 10 slogans that inspired India’s freedom movement​indiaGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalindiaIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiindiaAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameindiaLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietindiaBirthday Special: Spine-chilling quotes of Alfred Hitchcock that will keep you up at nightindia10 baby names that mean creativity and visionindiaSet up a mini lotus pond at home with these easy tipsindia Next123 Photostories  Seeds that supercharge muscle growth and overall healthNAFLD in kids: Harvard-trained doctor explains why this silent liver disease is on the riseFrom Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leavesFrom Cristiano Ronaldo’s million-dollar sparkler to Arjun Tendulkar’s intimate proposal: Celebrity engagements that created buzz in 2025Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 symptoms of Liver disease that can be seen on hands and feet5 expensive animal-shaped bags that’ll leave you almost shocked!Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowComplaining all the time?
