SUBSCRIBE NOW!Akhtar lambasted Pakistan’s batters, accusing them of not playing for the team.“We used to have expressive and explosive talent, and we played like that. We were never dependent on one individual — everyone chipped in,” Akhtar said on the Game On Hai show.“No one used to look for escape routes. The environment has changed, and in the last 10–15 years, everyone has started playing for themselves. Everyone is playing for their averages. The intent should be to win matches for your country.PollWhat do you think is the main issue with Pakistan's batting performance in the recent ODI series against the West Indies?Lack of teamworkPoor individual performancesInability to handle pressureAll of the above“We need to change the intent, the mindset, and create that atmosphere. You need to play according to modern cricket. How hard is that to understand?” he added.Pakistan’s chase fell apart early, collapsing to 23-4 in the ninth over, with three ducks among the top four batters. Opener Saim Ayub was caught behind on the third ball of the innings, Abdullah Shafique also failed to score, and captain Mohammad Rizwan was bowled by Seales for a golden duck in the third over.Seales claimed his fourth wicket when he trapped Babar Azam (9) lbw.“Halka sa seam hota hai toh musibat pad jaati hai (The ball moves a bit and they are in trouble),” Akhtar said. “Rawalpindi pitch lekar nahi ghoom sakte (You can’t carry Pindi pitches everywhere).”About the AuthorTOI Sports DeskThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.
