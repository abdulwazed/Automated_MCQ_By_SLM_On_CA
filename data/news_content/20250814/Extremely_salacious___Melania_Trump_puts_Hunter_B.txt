Trump demands Biden retract his statements, issue an apology, and remove the content. Her attorney asserts Biden's claims are false, disparaging, and widely circulated, threatening legal action if he doesn't comply. Melania Trump, Hunter Biden (AP) US First Lady Melania Trump has issued a $1 billion legal notice to Hunter Biden, alleging that he made "false, defamatory, disparaging, and inflammatory statements" about her regarding her connections with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. She is demanding that he remove the content, retract his statements, and issue a formal apology, warning of potential legal action if he fails to comply, reported Fox News.Alejandro Brito, the attorney serving as litigation counsel for the first lady, called on Biden to "immediately retract the false, defamatory, disparaging and inflammatory statements made about Mrs. Trump," referring to remarks made in a video interview with Channel 5’s Andrew Callaghan that was posted on YouTube early August.In the video interview titled “Hunter Biden Returns,” Biden, the former first son, claims, "Epstein introduced Melania to Trump. The connections are, like, so wide and deep.""Jeffrey Epstein introduced Melania, and that’s how Melania and the first lady and the President met,” Biden said.Brito described the statements as highly obscene and widely circulated across platforms, noting that the video has been republished by numerous media outlets, journalists, and political commentators with massive followings."These false, disparaging, defamatory, and inflammatory statements are extremely salacious and have been widely disseminated throughout various digital mediums," wrote Brito in a letter addressed to Biden and his attorney Abbe Lowell, as reported by Fox News. "Indeed, the video has since been re-published by various media outlets, journalists, and political commentators with millions of social media followers that have disseminated the false and defamatory statements therein to tens of millions of people worldwide."Brito asserted that Biden’s “source” for the false claims was “serial fabulist Michael Wolff,” whose allegations appeared in a Daily Beast article titled “Melania Trump ‘Very Involved’ in Epstein Scandal: Author.”"Given your vast history of trading on the names of others, including your surname, for your personal benefit, it is obvious that you published these false and defamatory statements about Mrs. Trump to draw attention to yourself," Brito added. Brito urged Biden to issue a prominent retraction of the video and all other false or damaging statements about Trump noting that if he does not comply with the demands, “Mrs. Trump will be left with no alternative but to enforce her legal and equitable rights, all of which are expressly reserved and are not waived, including by filing legal action for over $1 Billion Dollars in damages." "You are on notice,” Brito added. Biden failed to meet the deadline to comply with the requests, as per a source familiar with the situation, reported Fox News.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
