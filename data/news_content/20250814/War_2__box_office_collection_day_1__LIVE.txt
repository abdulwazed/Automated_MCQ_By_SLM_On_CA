However, it faces stiff competition from Rajinikanth's Coolie, which has earned ₹20.84 crore in the same period.  'War 2' has finally released in theatres and the film has got mixed reviews by the audience so far but it is off to a great start. The film is facing a huge competition from Rajinikanth's 'Coolie' which has also released today and this is one of the biggest clashes of movies. 'War 2' starring Hrithik Roshan, Jr NTR and Kiara Advani has released in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. While the pre-release ticket sales was not as high, just as the Telugu markets opened, the numbers from the advance bookings grew due to Jr NTR's presence as he's a huge star there. Thus, the film may be expected to do well in Telugu and Hindi both. It had collected Rs 16 crore gross already from the advance bookings. Hrithik calls Rajinikanth his 'first teacher' ahead of 'War 2' vs 'Coolie' clashAs of now, as far as the net collections are concerned. Till afternoon, 'War 2', has started off on a great note. As the collection so far is Rs 13.91 crore, according to Sacnilk. The film should have a day 1 number of atleast Rs 30-40 crore but time will tell if the numbers increase or decrease with spot bookings which will largely depend on positive word of mouth towards the film. Meanwhile, 'Coolie' starring Rajikinanth, Nagarjuna Akkineni, Aamir Khan, Shruti Haasan has made Rs 23.38 crore up till the same time. According to Box Office India, Trade analysts caution, that these numbers of 'War 2' don’t yet point to an “huge blockbuster type of weekend”, the kind the industry hopes for with such big-budget spectacles.'War 2' may look underwhelming when compared to some past juggernauts, but the ratio of advance sales to first-day collections has changed in recent years, making direct parallels tricky. Some previous “big ones,” as the trade hints, even had “advances which were tampered putting it in a nice way.” By contrast, War 2’s advance numbers are twice that of recent big titles like 'Raid 2' and 'Housefull 5'. Eventually, it's the reviews and now the footfalls during the weekend which will eventually determine the film's fate. But at the moment it looks like, 'Coolie' is definitely on the upper side in terms of the numbers.
