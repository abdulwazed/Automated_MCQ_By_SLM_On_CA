Dr. Saurabh Sethi highlights the alarming rise of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in adolescents due to unhealthy diets. Consuming sugary foods like pastries and soft drinks leads to excess fructose conversion into liver fat, potentially causing NAFLD. Untreated NAFLD can progress to severe liver issues, including cirrhosis, possibly requiring a liver transplant. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasingly becoming common among adolescents and young adults. Modern lifestyle factors, including poor diet, sedentary habits, and obesity, are key drivers of this issue. Dr. Saurabh Sethi, a California-based gastroenterologist trained at Harvard and Stanford, has now shared the shocking information on how the incidence of NAFLD is rising among kids. Dr. Sethi has explained how diet plays a key role in increasing the risk of NAFLD in kids. What is NAFLDNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common condition where fat builds up in your liver. It affects people who consume little to no alcohol. NAFLD is often linked to being overweight and can usually be treated with healthy lifestyle changes. Also referred to as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), this is a silent disease with few or no symptoms. In some cases, people may not experience any symptoms even if they develop cirrhosis due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), also referred to as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH).What makes NAFLD even more dangerous is that if left untreated, it can progress to chronic conditions such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and even liver cancer. This, over time, may also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.What are the symptoms of NAFLDMost people with NAFLD do not show any symptoms. Some people do not realise they have the condition until they discover it in some other test.Some of the symptoms include:Chronic fatigueFeeling generally unwellLiver pain or discomfort in the upper right side of your abdomen, under the ribsWhat causes NAFLD in children Dr. Sethi revealed that an unhealthy diet is one of the biggest reasons why children develop this condition. He explained that feeding children sugary foods can lead to NAFLD. “Serving your kid sugary foods like pastries, soft drinks, or cookies can be harmful. Sugar is 50% glucose and 50% fructose. While glucose provides energy to the whole body, excess fructose is converted into fat in the liver, potentially leading to fatty liver,” he said, in a video shared on Instagram.
