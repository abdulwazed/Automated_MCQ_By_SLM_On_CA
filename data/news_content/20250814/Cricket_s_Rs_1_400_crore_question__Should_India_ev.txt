Cricket's Rs 1,400 crore question: Should India even play Pakistan in the Asia Cup?
Pakistan’s latest meltdown against West Indies is another instance of their struggles across formats. The Asia Cup in UAE which could see them clash vs India thrice, provided both qualify for final, was meant to trigger hype and boost the broadcasters’ revenue. However, with Pakistan’s form and record vs India being so poor, one wonders how enthused cricket fans will be about what was a marquee match not too long ago

The Asia Cup in UAE which could see them clash vs India thrice, provided both qualify for final, was meant to trigger hype and boost the broadcasters’ revenue. However, with Pakistan’s form and record vs India being so poor, one wonders how enthused cricket fans will be about what was a marquee match not too long ago India could meet Pakistan thrice in the Asia Cup that will be played in September in the UAE. The debate over whether India should face Pakistan in the upcoming Asia Cup has divided opinion across the country, reflecting ongoing discussions about one of cricket’s most storied rivalries.Proponents argue that an India–Pakistan clash should proceed, asserting that the intense rivalry significantly boosts revenues, adding substantially to the coffers like no other cricket match-up. They contend that India, often regarded as the subcontinent’s ‘big brother’, has a role in financially sustaining other cricket-playing nations.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

They argue that there is no compelling reason to schedule cricket fixtures while broader bilateral tensions between the two neighbours remain unresolved.Amidst this heated debate, a common understanding among fans persists that the India–Pakistan rivalry remains cricket’s most heated and eagerly anticipated encounter. However, this perception warrants re-examination.Is the rivalry still as fierce? India and Pakistan last contested a Test match 18 years ago. Over the past 15 years, they have played 16 One Day Internationals (ODIs), with India securing twelve victories, and thirteen T20 matches, of which India has won ten.A snapshot of Pakistan's win-loss record since the 2022 T20 World Cup. The International Cricket Council (ICC) marketed the India–Pakistan match as the premier clash at the T20 World Cup in the United States last year. In the tournament, Pakistan not only lost to India but also to the hosts and the minor team USA in the first round.On Tuesday, the West Indies achieved a comprehensive victory over Pakistan in the third ODI in Tarouba, bowling them out for a mere 92 runs, underscoring the team’s ongoing struggles. Apart from home and away wins against Bangladesh earlier this year, the national team’s ODI performances have been lacklustre over the past two years.These statistics resurface regularly. Considering that India and Pakistan could potentially meet three times in the Asia Cup – during the league stage, the Super Four, and potentially the final – one wonders if it will live up to its anticipated status.India will meet Pakistan on September 14 in the group stage of the Asia Cup 2025.From an economic perspective, the India–England and India–Australia fixtures have seen exponential growth in recent years. For instance, the recent Anderson–Tendulkar Trophy, a five-Test series, recorded the highest-ever viewership numbers for digital broadcasts. Furthermore, the 2017 Border–Gavaskar series in India, followed by the 2024 leg in Australia, have become the highest-grossing bilateral cricket events to date.For the India–Pakistan rivalry to achieve similar financial success, the quality of cricket between the two nations would need a significant improvement. The primary benefits of India participating in the Asia Cup are twofold: firstly, assured financial gains for cricket boards across the subcontinent through media rights revenue; secondly, fostering goodwill ahead of discussions when India hosts the 2026 T20 World Cup.India vs Pakistan in last 15 yearsODI Matches: 17India wins: 12Pakistan wins: 4No Result: 1T20I matches: 13India wins: 10Pakistan wins: 3With media rights revenues valued at approximately Rs 1,400 crore for three tournaments (plus approximately Rs 290 crore from ground rights), each cricket board is guaranteed a minimum of Rs 290 to 332 crore over six years – an outcome unattainable without India’s involvement. In the context of the T20 World Cup, media rights revenues are several times higher than those of the Asia Cup.Ultimately, it is the financial stakes of the India–Pakistan match that remain high, while on-field competitiveness has diminished to a mere myth.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
