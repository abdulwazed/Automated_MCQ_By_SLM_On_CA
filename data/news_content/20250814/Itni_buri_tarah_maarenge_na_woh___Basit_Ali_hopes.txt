Pakistan cricket team during the second ODI against West Indies. (ANI) Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali, among others, have raised concern about the team's chances in the Asia Cup after a harrowing defeat against West Indies in the third ODI. West Indies came from 0-1 down in the series to clinch it 2-1, ending a 34-year drought over the 1992 World Cup winners.In the third match, played in Tarouba, Pakistan managed only 92 runs while chasing a target of 295. The 202-run loss was Pakistan's fourth biggest loss in their ODI history."I pray India refuse to play against Pakistan in the Asia Cup, just like how they did at the World Championships of Legends. Itni buri tarah maarenge na vo, ki aapki soch hai," Basit Ali said on The Game Plan YouTube channel.Basit Ali further addressed the possibility of losing to Afghanistan, stating: "If we lose to Afghanistan, no one would care much in this country. But everyone goes mad the moment you lose to India."PollWill Pakistan's performance improve in the upcoming Asia Cup?Yes, they will bounce backNo, it will be more of the sameThe Pakistani batting order crumbled from the start of their chase, with three top-order wickets falling within the first three overs. Openers Saim Ayub and Abdullah Shafique, along with captain Mohammad Rizwan, were dismissed without scoring any runs.Star batter Babar Azam could only contribute 9 runs, while Salman Agha managed 30 runs before his dismissal. The entire innings concluded in just 29.2 overs, with West Indies bowler Jayden Seales delivering an exceptional performance, taking 6 wickets for 18 runs.The loss against West Indies came despite Pakistan's earlier success in the T20I series against the same opposition, which they won 2-1 under Salman Agha's leadership.The upcoming Asia Cup, scheduled to take place in the UAE, will be played in the T20 format, serving as preparation for next year's T20 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.Pakistan's T20 squad composition may differ from their ODI team, as neither Babar Azam nor Mohammad Rizwan participated in the successful T20I series against West Indies, a pattern that might continue in the Asia Cup.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
