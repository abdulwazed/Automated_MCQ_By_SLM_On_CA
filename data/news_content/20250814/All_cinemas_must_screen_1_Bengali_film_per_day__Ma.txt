Till now, 12pm to 9pm was considered prime time and so Bengali movies were slotted at 12pm. We've changed the prime-time slot from 3pm to 9pm," minister Aroop Biswas said Wednesday.Earlier, all theatres were required to screen at least 120 Bengali films a year.Information and culture minister Indranil Sen called it a "historic day not only for cinema but for the revival of Bengali asmita and culture".'Screening 1 Bengali film a day will expand language market' Film industry seniors said the decision to screen at least one Bengali film during the 3pm-9pm prime slot could potentially expand the market for Bengali cinema and encourage new producers to invest in language content."This initiative will allow the audience to decide when it is most convenient for them to watch a Bengali film," said actor Prosenjit Chatterjee. Actor-politician Dev said the notification was a "significant win for the Bengali film industry".Multiplex audiences have long complained about the absence of Bengali films in popular late afternoon and evening slots, while directors have expressed frustration that despite positive reviews, their films are often removed from prime slots after only three days.About the AuthorPriyanka DasguptaPriyanka Dasgupta is the features editor of TOI Kolkata.
