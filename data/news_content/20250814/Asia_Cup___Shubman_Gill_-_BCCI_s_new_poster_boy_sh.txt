Asia Cup | Shubman Gill - BCCI's new poster boy should lead India in T20Is too
With Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma all but retired, the BCCI’s search for a new on-field leader and marketable face has turned to Shubman Gill. Already India’s Test captain, his growing brand value, T20I record, and leadership credentials make him a strong contender for the white-ball captaincy as well.

London: India's captain Shubman Gill acknowledges the crowd after India won the fifth Test match against England, at The Oval cricket ground, in London, England. (PTI Photo/R Senthilkumar)(PTI08_04_2025_000309B) New Delhi: In the past few weeks, social media videos have been doing the rounds where Shubman Gill's dismissals in Test cricket and then his centuries in the recently concluded Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy have been heavily compared. The lyrics from the song "Kachha Ghada" by singer Rahgir have been used, and the line says: “Ye jo has rahi hai duniya, meri nakamiyon pe... kal ye marenge taali meri kahaniyon pe” (Those who are mocking me for my failures today will clap for my story tomorrow).Eyebrows were raised when he was appointed as India's Test captain, with legends of the game questioning his spot in the playing XI. He answered his critics with 754 runs, almost overhauling Sunil Gavaskar's all-time record, and was presented with a customised shirt and cap by the 'Little Master.'IND vs ENG: Shubman Gill on Oval thriller, Siraj's spell, and missing Rishabh Pant and Jasprit BumrahGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Shubman Gill, a Gen Z, used Karan Aujla's famous track Ghabru on his Insagram with the caption, “The storm only rattles those who aren't ready for it.” He answered all his critics in a very nonchalant way -- both with his bat and his captaincy.India's captain Shubman Gill celebrates after scoring a century on the final day of the fourth cricket test match between England and India at Emirates Old Trafford, Manchester, England, July 27, 2025.(AP Photo/Jon Super)England wicketkeeper-batter Jos Buttler, who played under Gill's captaincy at the Gujarat Titans, has called his style of leadership a combination of the “intensity” of Virat Kohli and the “more laid-back” approach of Rohit Sharma. Buttler was right -- Gill hassled England with intent and elegance.The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) took a gamble, and Shubman swiftly filled the void left by Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma -- two of its biggest modern-day giants.Gill is not only filling the void with runs and leadership but also in brand value, and has already become the darling of the broadcasters. The leap can be gauged by MRF's investment on legendary batters going from Sachin Tendulkar to Virat Kohli and now Gill in a deal estimated to be worth Rs 8-10 crore per year.Remember the Virat Kohli Cam and Rohit Sharma Cam that broadcasters added to keep fans glued? Shubman is their answer.The other poster boy of Indian cricket is Jasprit Bumrah, hands down the magician who wears many hats. But with his persistent back injury and workload management, he won't be playing all of India’s matches.The brand equationFrom a commercial standpoint, Kohli and Rohit weren’t just cricketers; they were multi-million-dollar brands. Their mere presence boosted television ratings, ticket sales, and sponsorship value. Broadcasters built campaigns around them. Sponsors tailored entire ad shoots to their availability. Losing both at once was always going to create a vacuum, and the BCCI’s marketing minds are well aware that a successor must be groomed not just on the field, but in the marketplace.With Shubman Gill, they have a young poster boy for the next generation. With his elegant strokeplay, calm demeanour, and youthful appeal, he has already become a favourite with advertisers.Suryakumar Yadav has an impressive track record as India’s full-time T20I captain after Rohit Sharma retired from the format following the 2024 T20 World Cup triumph. Under his leadership, India have won 17 out of 22 matches.New Delhi, Aug 8 (IANS) Former India wicketkeeper-batter Parthiv Patel believes Test skipper Shubman Gill answered all challenges and questions through his prolific run-scoring spree during the recently drawn Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy series against England.There is no question about Surya the T20I batter -- he can entertain the crowd. But can he fill stadiums?This is the question coach Gautam Gambhir, chief selector Ajit Agarkar, and top BCCI officials will have to answer during the Asia Cup squad selection, given that the T20 World Cup will be played at home. Will they extend the line of thought by giving Shubman the white-ball captaincy as well? It would also make life easier for coach Gambhir. No coach anywhere in the world would want to deal with different captains for different formats.Numbers don’t lieBy no means is Shubman Gill a dud in the T20I format.In 21 T20Is, his strike rate is close to 140, and with added responsibility, he can only flourish - as seen in England. His Test average was in the mid-30s before the start of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, and he ended up chasing Don Bradman's batting record. Gill has shown that he is someone who will not buckle under added responsibility; instead, he thrives on it.In the IPL, he captains Gujarat Titans. In the first season, he showed some vulnerability but bounced back in his second season as captain, guiding them to the playoffs.New Delhi, Aug 7 (IANS) After captaining India to a 2-2 Test series draw in England, Shubman Gill has been appointed as the captain of the North Zone squad for the upcoming Duleep Trophy, starting on August 28 in Bengaluru.Since moving to Titans from Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), Gill has risen immediately to the leadership group under then-captain Hardik Pandya. He was pivotal in Titans winning the IPL title in 2022 with 483 runs at the top. Next season, he responded with an 890-run season with a strike rate of 157.80. In the last three IPL seasons, his strike rates have been 158.80, 147.40, and 155.88.His childhood mentor Gurkeerat Singh Mann has explained how Gill worked on his power-hitting.“He has always been a traditional batter, who was told by his father that hitting in the air is a sin in cricket. But once he was tipped as not good enough for T20I cricket, he added that power game to his repertoire -- and now see the sixes he hits, all of them above 90m,” Mann told TimesofIndia.com.“Before he joined Gujarat Titans, he started training in an open net at the IS Bindra Stadium in Mohali. He wanted to make sure that he was hitting it long and big. He was not happy with the sixes falling just behind the ropes. He used to get miffed. But that tells you his hunger to improve,” he added.PollDo you believe Shubman Gill can fill the leadership void left by Kohli and Sharma?AbsolutelySomewhatNot reallyNot at allIf the BCCI takes the bait by making Gill captain for the Asia Cup, it will provide them with the opportunity to build a young, fearless side under a fresh leader -- a rare combination.With two giants gone and Bumrah’s appearances in internationals carefully rationed, Gill could be the steady, stylish, and strategic leader India needs -- one who can carry the team on the field and the brand off it. The stage is his; the time might just be now.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
