Ayan Mukerji's directorial venture is receiving mixed reviews, with praise for action but criticism for its storyline. Rajinikanth’s 'Coolie' leads with ₹11.63 crore.  'War 2' has finally hit theatres, and early estimates suggest a promising start for the Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR-led action thriller. Early Box Office EstimatesThe film that is reportedly tracking an estimated Rs 30 crore opening, set the cash registers ringing this Thursday morning, by recording a good start at the box office. According to industry tracker Sacnilk, the film has raked in approximately Rs 6.16 crore India net across all languages so far.'War 2' kicked off with strong morning show occupancies, managing to cross the Rs 5 crore mark with just early ticket sales and first shows. The numbers are expected to see a significant jump during the high-traffic evening and night shows, which traditionally contribute the bulk of first-day collections.Directed by Ayan Mukerji, the film has been generating mixed reactions from audiences. While many have praised the high-octane action sequences, grand scale, and the on-screen presence of Hrithik and Jr NTR, others have criticised its template storyline and uneven pacing. Social media reviews ranged from “Fun & paisa vasool” to labelling it “strictly MID” and “a recycled, same-old template.”Coolie's Impressive CollectionsHowever, the box office battle this Independence Day weekend is far from one-sided. Sharing the release date with 'War 2' is superstar Rajinikanth’s highly anticipated 'Coolie', which, as per early estimates, has recorded nearly double the earnings. The action entertainer has reportedly grossed Rs 11.63 crore India net across all languages so far, fuelled by massive fan turnout, particularly in South India.With both films eyeing a strong Independence Day holiday boost, trade analysts predict a huge Rs 80 crore combined box office earning this Thursday.For now, 'Coolie' holds the lead, but it remains to be seen if 'War 2' has what it takes to narrow the gap later in the day. Both films are also expected to receive a huge boost in collections on Friday, considering that it is a national holiday.
