She acknowledged his role in delivering justice concerning her husband Raju Pal's murder. She credited Adityanath's zero-tolerance policy for the action against Atiq Ahmed, the accused in the 2005 killing. She highlighted the sense of trust the state now has in the Chief Minister.  Samajwadi Party MLA Pooja Pal NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party MLA Pooja Pal on Thursday thanked Uttar Pradesh chief ministerYogi Adityanath for bringing her justice, saying he had “buried” dreaded gangster Atiq Ahmed, who was behind the killing of her husband, Raju Pal.She said CM Yogi's "zero-tolerance policy" against crime delivered justice in the 2005 murder of her husband, who was the BSP MLA."Everyone knows who murdered my husband (Raju Pal). I want to thank the chief minister for bringing me justice and hearing me when nobody else did,” she said during the 24-hour marathon debate on Vision Document 2047. “The CM gave justice to many other women like me in Prayagraj by bringing in policies like zero tolerance that led to the killing of criminals like Atiq Ahmed. Today, the entire state looks at the CM with trust.”She added, “Mere pati ke hatyare Atiq Ahmed ko Mukhya Mantri ne mitti mein milaane ka kaam kiya” (The chief minister has buried my husband’s murderer Atiq Ahmed).Pooja Pal said she raised her voice when no one was ready to stand up to criminals like Atiq Ahmed. “When I started getting exhausted with this fight, CM Yogi Adityanath gave me justice,” she told the House.Raju Pal was shot dead in Prayagraj in 2005, days after his wedding. The main accused, gangster-politician Atiq Ahmed, faced trial for years without a final verdict. In February 2023, Umesh Pal, a key witness in the case, was killed in a daylight attack in Prayagraj’s Sulem Saray area. Several rounds were fired and crude bombs hurled at Umesh and his gunners.The killings reignited pressure on the state’s crackdown against organised crime. Atiq Ahmed and his brother Ashraf were later arrested. On April 15, 2023, both were shot dead by assailants posing as journalists while being escorted for a medical check-up in Prayagraj.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Activists of the left parties take part in a protest rally against alleged illegal detention and torture of Bengali-speaking migrant workers, in Kolkata (PTI photo) NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) concerning the detention and alleged torture of Bengali-speaking migrant workers under suspicion of being Bangladeshi nationals.However, Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi declined to issue an interim order regarding the detentions, listing the matter for next week; noting that such decisions would have implications, particularly for individuals who have entered from neighbouring countries.'Nazi' BJP Targeting 'Bengalis': TMC MP Mahua Moitra's Explosive Interview On Gurugram Crackdown"States where these migrant workers are working have the right to inquire from their state of origin about their bonafide but the problem is in the interregnum. If we pass any interim orders, then it will have consequences, especially those who have illegally come from across the border and need to be deported under the law," the bench said, as quoted by PTI.The top court told advocate Prashant Bhushan, representing the West Bengal Migrant Welfare Board, to await responses from the Central government and nine states: Odisha, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Delhi, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana and West Bengal.The case centres around individuals allegedly facing harassment by states solely for speaking Bengali and possessing Bengali-language documents, following a Ministry of Home Affairs circular, as argued by Bhushan."They are being detained while an inquiry is being held about their bonafide and in some cases, they are even tortured. Kindly pass some interim order that no detention will be held. I have no problem with enquiries but there should not be any detention," the advocate said in his argument.The apex court, however, did acknowledge the necessity to establish procedures to protect legitimate citizens from harassment.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

A video of a schoolboy riding a horse to school while being accompanied by a dog has gone viral on social media. The footage, reportedly captured in Meghalaya's hilly terrain, shows the student in his school uniform traveling to school on horseback, with a black dog running alongside.The clip was shared on Instagram by the account 'twinklejoanna' and quickly captured the attention of social media users across platforms. "A casual ride to school," stated the original social media post describing the footage.The combination of the young student's unconventional commute and his faithful canine companion invoked numerous reactions from viewers online.The location appears to be the West Khasi Hills region near Nongstoin, though the exact location and authenticity of the footage could not be independently verified."We saw him Saturday. It's West khasi hills right? Near nongstoin," commented a user, attempting to identify the location."A horse as a ride and a dog to see him off. The coolest guy," said another social media user.The unusual sight of a horse being used for school transportation led to humorous speculation about the school's facilities."I would like to see the parking lot of the school," remarked one curious viewer.Some users drew pop culture references from the scene."Phantom spotted, just in case anybody remembers the phantom," noted one commenter.The video particularly resonated with viewers, who appreciated the cultural aspects of Northeast India."Bro is the AURA himself. This just made my day honestly. People in NE know what they are doing," expressed an enthusiastic viewer.The presence of the dog following the horse and rider captured special attention from viewers."If only I could also go to my school on a horse, while my pet dog would have followed. Just amazing," shared one nostalgic commenter.The video presents a stark contrast to typical urban school commutes, highlighting the diverse transportation methods still prevalent in different parts of India.The footage has become what social media users term as 'aura farming,' referring to content that naturally generates significant online engagement and admiration.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The court heard arguments highlighting the severity of dog bite incidents and the need for a resolution, while also considering concerns about the removal of stray dogs from the streets and the lack of adequate shelter facilities.  NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday reserved the order on an interim prayer seeking a stay on the order by its two-judge bench over the stray dogs. While hearing, the apex court grilled the local authorities for their inaction, which led to severe problems.Huge uproar erupted after the August 11 order passed by Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan. Taking cognisance of the matter, Chief Justice B R Gavai withdrew the case and posted it for hearing on Thursday. "The whole problem is because of the inaction of local authorities," said the apex court during the hearing. Here are 10 takeaways from SC's hearing: SC's observationThe three-judge bench comprising Justices Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria reserved order on the interim prayer seeking a stay on the August 11 order of picking up strays from the streets of Delhi-NCR.The apex court grilled civic officials, saying, "The whole problem is because of the inaction of local authorities. Everyone who has filed an intervention will have to take responsibility."Children are dying, issue needs to be resolved, Delhi Govt tells SCDelhi government, during the hearing, told SC that the issue of stray dogs needs to be resolved and contested, adding that children are dying due to dog bites, causing rabies.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Delhi government, presented data before the bench saying, over 37 lakh reported dog bites in a year in the country. "Nobody is an animal hater," Mehta told the bench.Mehta told the Supreme Court that it is a contest between a vocal minority vs a silent majority who are suffering because of dog bites.'Vocal minority vs silent majority'Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who was appearing for an NGO, asserted that the situation is "very serious" and the matter needed to be argued in depth.Sibal further sought a stay on the order passed by the apex court on August 11, directing the removal of stray dogs from streets.He asked, "Has the Municipal corporation built shelter homes for dogs? Have the dogs been sterilised? Now, the dogs are being picked up. However, the order states that once sterilised, the stray dogs should not be left out in the community."Singhvi also opposed the two-bench order, saying that dog bites exist, but there have been zero rabies deaths in Delhi this year. "Of course, dog bites are bad, but you cannot create a horror situation like this," he said.The apex court will decide whether the order passed by its division bench on the stray dog issue is to be stayed or not.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

'1 person 1 vote exists since 1951': EC slams Rahul Gandhi, oppn's use of term 'vote chori'; seeks proof
The Election Commission has strongly refuted Rahul Gandhi's "vote chori" allegations, deeming them an attack on Indian voters and election staff. Gandhi claimed widespread vote theft in Karnataka, citing duplicate entries and fake addresses. The ECI challenged Gandhi to provide evidence, but Gandhi insists the data is from the Election Commission itself, daring them to deny its accuracy.

Gandhi claimed widespread vote theft in Karnataka, citing duplicate entries and fake addresses. The ECI challenged Gandhi to provide evidence, but Gandhi insists the data is from the Election Commission itself, daring them to deny its accuracy. File photo NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Thursday hit back at Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi and other INDIA bloc parties over their repeated use of the term “vote chori,” saying such “dirty phrases” were aimed at creating a false narrative. The poll body called it a direct attack on crores of Indian voters and an assault on the integrity of lakhs of election staff.The ECI stressed that the “One Person, One Vote” law has been in place since India’s first elections in 1951-52. The poll body said anyone with proof of a person voting twice should submit it to the commission with a sworn affidavit, instead of branding all voters as “chor” without evidence.PollDo you think the current electoral process in India is transparent?YesNoOn August 7, Rahul Gandhi ran through a presentation at a press conference in New Delhi, where he alleged large-scale "vote chori" (vote theft) in Karnataka’s Mahadevapura assembly segment, claiming over 1 lakh votes were "stolen" through methods such as duplicate entries, fake addresses, and bulk registrations at single addresses. "Our internal polling predicted 16 Lok Sabha seats for Congress in Karnataka; we won nine. In Mahadevapura alone, we found 100,250 votes stolen in five different ways," Gandhi had said, presenting what he called Congress’s internal analysis of voting patterns.Later, the election commission asked Rahul Gandhi to submit a formal declaration supporting his "vote chori" (vote theft) claim, along with the names of electors allegedly wrongfully included in the voter list, in order to initiate necessary proceedings.Reacting to the election commission, Rahul said: "I'm saying it publicly to everybody. Take it as an oath. This is their data, and we are displaying their data. This is not our data". "Interestingly, they haven't denied the information," he further said. "I'm a politician. What I say to the people is my word. I'm saying it publicly to everybody. Take it as an oath. This is their data, and we are displaying their data. This is not our data. This is Election Commission data. Interestingly, they haven't denied the information. They haven't told the voter list that Rahul Gandhi is talking about are wrong. Why don't you say they wrong? Because you know the truth. You know that we know that you have done this across the country," the Congress leader told news agency ANI.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the court that steps are being taken but there are “peculiar situations” in the region."You cannot ignore what happened in Pahalgam... It is for Parliament and the Executive to take a decision," the CJI said.Mehta pointed out that assembly elections were held as promised to the Constitution Bench that had upheld the abrogation of Article 370 and the bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories. He added, “This is not the time for petitioners to muddy the waters.”PollWhat do you think is the most important factor in restoring statehood to Jammu and Kashmir?Ensuring regional security and stabilityProtecting democratic rights and developmentThe petition, filed last year by academician Zahoor Ahmad Bhat and socio-political activist Khurshaid Ahmad Malik, seeks directions to restore statehood within two months. It argues that keeping J&K as a Union Territory for nearly five years has weakened its democratic setup, caused “grave losses” to development, and hurt the rights of its citizens.The plea also says the delay violates the Supreme Court’s earlier directions to restore statehood “at the earliest and as soon as possible,” especially since assembly election results were declared on October 8, 2024.In its December 2023 verdict, the Supreme Court ruled that Article 370, which gave special status to J&K, was only a temporary provision. It held that the President had the power to revoke it after the state’s Constituent Assembly ceased to exist in 1957.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta highlighted the severity of dog bite incidents and rabies deaths, emphasizing the need for a solution balancing animal welfare and public safety. Senior advocates argued against the order to catch stray dogs, questioning the availability of shelter homes and sterilization efforts, as the court reserves its decision.  NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday reserved order on interim prayer seeking a stay on August 11 order of picking up strays from the streets. While lashing out, the apex court said that the problem of stray dogs has arisen "because of the inaction of civic authorities in implementing rules and laws." The SC will decide whether the order passed by its division bench on the stray dog issue is to be stayed or not.Delhi government told the Supreme Court that it has to intervene to check the menace of stray dogs in the country as the three-judge SC bench heard the matter.Vocal minority vs a silent majority Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said that it is a contest between a vocal minority vs a silent majority who are suffering because of dog bites.Mehta told the apex court that the situation is "very serious" and the matter needs to be argued in depth. He said that children are dying and sterilisation does not stop rabies, even if you immunise them. "That does not stop the mutilation of children," he added. Mehta presented a data before Supreme Court saying "37 lakhs dog bites reported in country in 2024. Rabies deaths were 305 deaths for the same year, WHO's modelling shows a much higher number. Nobody is an animal hater." He added that children are unable to go out to play in the open. "The court will have to find a solution. A vocal minority views as against the silent suffering majority view," he continued.Order has to be stayed, says SibalA batch of top senior advocates led by Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Kapil Sibal, who were present for the cause of stray dogs, pleaded to the SC that the court's order passed on Monday to catch stray dogs has to be stayed.Meanwhile, Sibal told SC that the August 11 order directing authorities in Delhi-NCR to start picking up stray dogs needs to be stayed.While seeking a stay, Sibal, who is appearing for an NGO, asked, "Has the Municipal corporation built shelter homes for dogs? Have the dogs been sterilised? Now, the dogs are being picked up. However, the order states that once sterilised, the stray dogs should not be left out in the community." Singhvi also opposed the August 11 order and said dog bites exist, but there have been zero rabies deaths in Delhi this year. "Of course, dog bites are bad, but you cannot create a horror situation like this," he added. Stray dog row   Earlier on Wednesday, Chief Justice B R Gavai withdrew the case from a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan and posted it for rehearing on Thursday before the three-judge special bench comprising Justices Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria. Gavai's announcement came after public outrage over the apex court's directive that it passed on Monday, ordering to removal of all stray dogs and putting them in shelters by Delhi government and civic bodies of Gurugram, Noida and Ghaziabad. The two-judge bench noted that there was an "extremely grim" situation due to stray dog bites resulting in rabies.
