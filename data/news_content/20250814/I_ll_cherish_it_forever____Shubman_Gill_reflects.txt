The double ton in Birmingham is obviously something I’ll cherish forever and will be one of the highlights of my tour to England.”Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Gill’s numbers backed up his words. He was the standout performer in the Anderson Tendulkar Trophy, scoring 754 runs in 10 innings at an average of 75.40. July alone brought him 567 runs in three Tests at an average of 94.50, including three centuries and a career-best 269 at Edgbaston. That innings was not only a personal milestone but also the spark for India’s comeback after losing the series opener in Leeds.PollDo you believe Shubman Gill will continue to excel as India's captain in future series?Yes, definitelyProbablyUncertainNo, I don't think so His 430-run aggregate in Birmingham is one of the highest in Test history and the best by any visiting batter in England. Along the way, Gill surpassed Sunil Gavaskar’s record for most runs in a Test series as Indian captain and became the first Asian to score more than 700 runs in a series on English soil. While he had lean patches at Lord’s and The Oval, his earlier contributions ensured India finished the series 2-2. The award is Gill’s fourth, cementing his status as one of the game’s most consistent and impactful players.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
