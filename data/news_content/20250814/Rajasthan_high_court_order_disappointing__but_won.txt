"This time I am not going to lose my cool," Justice Pardiwala said at the outset with a smile on his face. The case before it, in which an FIR was filed against a couple for not paying their dues to a seller, who lodged a complaint for recovery of the money, had been adjudicated by the Rajasthan high court. Granting anticipatory bail to the couple, the court said that litigants were forced to move the apex court for relief because proper law was not being applied by lower courts and high courts, which leads to unnecessary litigation and harassment of litigants. In this case, the couple had purchased plywood from a seller and paid Rs 3 lakh but then allegedly refused to pay the balance amount of Rs 12 lakh, making the seller file a case against them. tnnSC: A little application of mind by HCs will curb such litigation   The bench held that the problem of not following well-settled law was prevalent across the country and said a little application of mind by HCs would go a long way in curbing such litigation.Appearing against the couple, state govt questioned their conduct, as they had been on the run. The bench, however, said this could be because of the fear of police.The bench also disapproved of the stand of the public prosecutor before the HC, contending that it would not be possible to recover the money if bail was granted to the couple. "According to the state, police machinery is required to be involved in the recovery of money. Why do you want police to be involved for recovery of money - to squeeze the remaining amount for the seller?" it asked the advocate appearing for the state.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Seeds that supercharge muscle growth and overall healthFrom Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leavesTop 5 Getaways in North and South India to Work RemotelyFrom Cristiano Ronaldo’s million-dollar sparkler to Arjun Tendulkar’s intimate proposal: Celebrity engagements that created buzz in 2025Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 expensive animal-shaped bags that’ll leave you almost shocked!Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;
