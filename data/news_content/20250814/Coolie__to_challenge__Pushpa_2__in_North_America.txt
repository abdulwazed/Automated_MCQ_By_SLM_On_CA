Rajinikanth's 'Coolie' has premiered in North America with a record-breaking USD 2.9 million, becoming the biggest Tamil film premiere ever in the region. It is now challenging 'Pushpa 2' for the highest premiere day collections for an Indian film. Despite competition from 'War 2', 'Coolie's' success is driven by Rajinikanth's popularity and a star-studded cast. Rajinikanth’s latest film Coolie is off to a flying start in North America, with premiere show earnings touching an impressive USD 2.9 million as per distributor Prathyangira Cinemas. The figure instantly made Coolie the biggest Tamil film premiere in North American history and placed it 9th among the highest-grossing Tamil films of all time in the region, an extraordinary feat considering these numbers come from just premiere shows. What’s more,Coolie could go one step further and challenge Allu Arjun’s Pushpa 2 for the record of biggest premiere day collections in North America for an Indian film. Pushpa 2, which released last year had a record-breaking collection of USD 3.34 million from its premiere shows, setting a high bar for every major release since.Pushpa 2 went on to mint over USD 15.26 million by the end of its theatrical run while it’s breakeven number was USD 15 million leaving the distributors with very little profit. Coolie on the other hand will need to cross USD 7.5 million to break even, now the profit of the film is dependent on the upcoming weekend and the strong word of mouth. Given the pace at which Coolie is selling tickets, trade experts say it’s “easily primed” to surpass that figure. The combination of Rajinikanth’s pan-Indian appeal and Lokesh Kanagaraj’s mass entertainer brand has created intense buzz, translating into strong advance sales across Tamil and Telugu speaking diaspora audiences in the United States and Canada.However, the film’s ultimate tally will depend heavily on show count availability, a factor complicated by its high-profile clash with Aditya Chopra’s War 2 starring Hrithik Roshan, Jr NTR, and Kiara Advani, the action spectacle has also released this weekend, commanding premium screens and a significant share of IMAX and PLF (Premium Large Format) slots. This direct competition means Coolie may have fewer screenings than it would in an open weekend, potentially capping its ceiling despite huge demand.Even with the clash, Coolie’s USD 2.9 million start is nothing short of phenomenal. To put it in perspective, Rajinikanth’s 2019 blockbuster Petta earned USD 2.55 million in its entire North American run, while his recent hit Vettaiyan finished at USD 2.83 million and Kamal Haasan’s Vikram earned USD 2.84 million, Coolie has essentially matched or surpassed all of them in just its first few hours.The movie’s performance is also a testament to its wide appeal, powered by a star-studded ensemble featuring Nagarjuna, Soubin Shahir, Shruti Haasan, Sathyaraj, Upendra, and even Aamir Khan in a key role. The casting has given Coolie significant traction across South Indian diaspora markets while also drawing attention in Bollywood-leaning territories.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
