A video of a schoolboy riding a horse to school while being accompanied by a dog has gone viral on social media. The footage, reportedly captured in Meghalaya's hilly terrain, shows the student in his school uniform traveling to school on horseback, with a black dog running alongside.The clip was shared on Instagram by the account 'twinklejoanna' and quickly captured the attention of social media users across platforms. "A casual ride to school," stated the original social media post describing the footage.The combination of the young student's unconventional commute and his faithful canine companion invoked numerous reactions from viewers online.The location appears to be the West Khasi Hills region near Nongstoin, though the exact location and authenticity of the footage could not be independently verified."We saw him Saturday. It's West khasi hills right? Near nongstoin," commented a user, attempting to identify the location."A horse as a ride and a dog to see him off. The coolest guy," said another social media user.The unusual sight of a horse being used for school transportation led to humorous speculation about the school's facilities."I would like to see the parking lot of the school," remarked one curious viewer.Some users drew pop culture references from the scene."Phantom spotted, just in case anybody remembers the phantom," noted one commenter.The video particularly resonated with viewers, who appreciated the cultural aspects of Northeast India."Bro is the AURA himself. This just made my day honestly. People in NE know what they are doing," expressed an enthusiastic viewer.The presence of the dog following the horse and rider captured special attention from viewers."If only I could also go to my school on a horse, while my pet dog would have followed. Just amazing," shared one nostalgic commenter.The video presents a stark contrast to typical urban school commutes, highlighting the diverse transportation methods still prevalent in different parts of India.The footage has become what social media users term as 'aura farming,' referring to content that naturally generates significant online engagement and admiration.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
