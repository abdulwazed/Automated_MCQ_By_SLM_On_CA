Ravi. She cited Ravi's lack of contribution to Tamil Nadu's development and disregard for Tamil identity as reasons. Her act has ignited discussions about student autonomy and political expression within academic ceremonies.  A bold act of protest at Manonmaniam Sundaranar University’s 32nd convocation has become a talking point across Tamil Nadu. Jean Joseph, a PhD graduate in Human Resource Management, chose not to receive her degree from Tamil Nadu Governor R N Ravi, challenging the long-standing tradition of students collecting degrees directly from the Governor, who is also the university’s chancellor.Convocation ceremony in focusThe convocation, held at V.O.C. Auditorium, conferred degrees to 37,376 students from 104 affiliated colleges and the university, spanning bachelor’s, master’s, MPhil, and PhD programmes. 759 graduates were present to receive their degrees in person, including 650 PhD scholars, and 109 medallists were honoured for academic excellence. The ceremony featured a convocation address by A P Dimri, Director of the Indian Institute of Geomagnetism, under the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India.Traditionally, students pose for photographs with the Governor after receiving their certificates. In a surprising move, Joseph accepted her degree from Vice-Chancellor N Chandrasekar instead, bypassing Governor Ravi entirely.A stand for choice and Tamil identityDuring the convocation, Joseph bypassed Governor R N Ravi and chose to receive her degree from Vice-Chancellor N Chandrasekar, breaking with the traditional practice of posing with the Governor. Explaining her decision to TNN, she said she acted “only as a way to register protest against the governor, who has not contributed anything to the development of the state and has shown he is against the welfare of the people of Tamil Nadu.” Adding to this, she mentioned that she “believes in the 'Dravidian' model of governance.”She added further in a statement to ANI, highlighting her perspective on student choice and respect for Tamil culture: “I believe the Governor has done nothing for Tamil Nadu or the Tamil language. Many others, such as the Chief Minister or the Education Minister, are more qualified to present degrees. It should be the student’s choice. My fellow students appreciated my decision. If it were wrong, no one would have congratulated me. I don’t want to take my degree from someone who does not respect our land, language, and identity.”Joseph emphasised that her protest was political in principle, not personal, and many students reportedly supported her for taking a stand for Tamil identity, language, and governance.Academic journeyJean Joseph has an impressive academic background. She completed her B.Com at Hindu College, Nagercoil, followed by an MCA at Mepco College, Sivakasi, before earning her PhD in Human Resource Management from MSU. Her research focused on human resource strategies and organisational development, preparing her for a career in academia and organisational consulting.Reactions and wider debateThe incident has sparked discussions across campuses about student autonomy, ceremonial traditions, and political expression. As reported by TNN, BJP’s Tamil Nadu president, K Annamalai, criticised the move as “unnecessary and useless drama” aimed at political gain. Joseph’s husband, Rajan, serves as the district student wing secretary of the DMK, adding a political dimension to her action.Many educators and students see her decision as an example of how ceremonial traditions can intersect with political awareness and personal principles, particularly in a state like Tamil Nadu, where student activism and regional pride have long been influential.Joseph’s stand has become a reference point for discussions on whether students should have the freedom to choose from whom they receive their degrees, a debate that could shape convocation practices in the years to come.Ready to navigate global policies?
