Initial reactions are divided, praising the action and star performances of Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR, while some criticize the storyline and pacing. The film's grand scale and thrilling moments are highlighted, but concerns arise over the second half's execution and predictable plot elements.  The much-awaited War 2 has finally been released in cinemas around the world, and fans of leading stars Hrithik Roshan with Jr NTR can't keep calm. Fans around the globe got together to celebrate the film's release by rushing to theatres to catch the early shows of the pan-India spy spectacle directed by Ayan Mukerji. The film that was touted to be one of the biggest cinematic events of the year, got a hero's welcome with some fans lining up as early as 4 am on Thursday morning to catch the screening. Some others even fired off crackers and conducted pooja ceremonies outside the theatres to celebrate its release.While fan excitement was sky-high, early Twitter reviews reveal a mixed bag — with praise for the action and star power, but criticism over the storyline, pacing, and execution.Within hours of its release, Twitter was flooded with posts from moviegoers sharing their first impressions. Many fans praised the film’s action-packed first half, admitting, "Very Good First Half."Several praised the engaging pace and larger-than-life moments, particularly the whistle-worthy entry scenes. A fan enthused, “Coolie will get a tough competition! #War2 is a clean Block Buster! What a dance, screen dominance of NTR.” Others appreciated the film’s grand scale and buildup.However, a section of the audience pointed out that while the first half was gripping, the second half felt comparatively weaker, with pacing issues and predictable plot turns. Some even summed up their experience with the blunt verdict saying, “#War2 is a strictly mediocre action thriller, leaning heavily on style over substance! The storyline is somewhat different from the previous spy universe films, which had potential but wasn’t able to fully capitalize on it.”Another summarised their experience as, “An okayish action entertainer. Not great, not bad either – strictly MID. Note: NTR fans should keep their expectations in check. There are moments where you whistle, but there are moments that will frustrate you.”Another claimed that the film's plot was 'recycled' saying, "War 2 is a recycled, same-old template with no genuine highs or enjoyable moments between the leads in a lengthy runtime. Overall it’s a disappointing action film in YRF series after Tiger 3."Still another added, "good back story, but story falls flat & predictable. Lacks emotional connect."Some outright disliked the film, calling out the over-the-top action, and 'wasted' potential of a Hrithik and Jr NTR collab. One said, "The movie feels like small ads of mountain dews stitched together with no screenplay, poor editing, Few cringeworthy dialogues, laughable action sequences twists which can be seen from miles, one expression acting by #JrNTR..big disappointment from #RRR star! The action scenes are so bad,it feels embarassing ( B2 Bomber scene was worst)...so far just Hritik all the way..The much awaited #JanaabeAali is worst song from movie so far! Unintentionally funny with average choreography!!!"Another said, "A rare North–South star combo wasted. NTR is utterly underused, the plot is template, action is bland, and execution is weak—leaving audiences walking out dissatisfied.""War 2 is terrible," said another and added, "The film starts really well and is very engaging till they force the dance sequence out of nowhere. The film is completely derailed out of track just before the 15 mins to interval. It’s all downhill after that."Fans of both stars, however, continue to defend the film’s larger-than-life scale, its stylish cinematography, and the thrill of seeing two powerhouse performers share the screen. "Just watched War 2 here in California. I must say it’s an excellent movie with all actors acting great & the story was awesome with lots of twists & turns. CGI was not the best, but everything else was just good vibes, good story. Fun & paisa vasool," said another viewer.Another claimed that the film "Opens new horizons for Spy Universe." The fan went on to add, "Nothing forced staying exceptionally true to story! Twists that keep you entertained to end and beyond. Action larger than life, scale grandest! Music surreal. Locations breathtaking. Entertainment to the core. Builds up."War 2 sees Hrithik reprise his role as Kabir, a RAW agent with a turbulent past, now facing off against elite operative Vikram, played by Jr NTR. The globe-trotting narrative promises espionage, betrayal, and explosive action sequences — hallmarks of the Spy Universe. Kiara Advani, Ashutosh Rana, and Anil Kapoor also play pivotal roles.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
