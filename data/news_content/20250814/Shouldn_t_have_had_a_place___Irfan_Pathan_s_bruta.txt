Rohit Sharma retired from Tests in May (Image via Getty Images) Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has claimed that Rohit Sharma might have found it difficult to retain his place in the Test team during the latter half of 2024 had he not been the captain.Pathan recalled Rohit’s poor run during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia earlier that year. The opener averaged just 6.20 across three matches before opting out of the final Test in Sydney. “Rohit Sharma is an amazing player in white-ball cricket, but his average in Test cricket that year was 6, so we said that if he was not the captain, he would not have had a place in the team, and this is true,” Pathan said, speaking in a Lallantop video.IRFAN PATHAN FLYING FROM MUMBAI SPOTTED AT AIRPORTGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! At the time, Rohit addressed the decision in an interview with Pathan and Jatin Sapru during the match on January 5. “This is what I say. Stand down. I will say a few words, fifty words will be made out of it. So basically, runs are not coming from my bat, I am not in form, it is an important match, we need players in form, the boys in our batting are not in form, so you cannot carry too many out-of-form players in the team,” Rohit had explained. “It was difficult for me to take this decision but if everything is put in front of us, then this decision was sensible, and I will not think too much ahead. What the team needed at this time, this was the only thought, and there was no other thought apart from that,” he added. Pathan also addressed perceptions that he and others had been overly supportive of Rohit. “People say that we supported Rohit Sharma more than necessary. Of course, when someone comes to interview on your broadcasting channel, you will not misbehave with them, right? You have invited him, so you will behave politely… we had to show that, because he was our guest,” Pathan said.PollDo you think Rohit Sharma would have retained his place in the Test team if he wasn't captain?Yes, definitelyNo, he would have been dropped However, he maintained his stance on Rohit’s place in the side. “We had said that he should keep fighting, but that said, he should not have had a place in the playing XI. If he was not the captain of the team, he would have been dropped.” Rohit later rediscovered his touch in white-ball cricket, guiding India to the Champions Trophy title in March 2025, before retiring from Test cricket on May 7.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
