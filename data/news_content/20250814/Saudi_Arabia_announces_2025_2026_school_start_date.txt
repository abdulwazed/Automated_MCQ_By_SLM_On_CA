Ministry of Education has confirmed the start dates for the upcoming 2025–2026 academic year/Representative Image Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Education has confirmed the start dates for the upcoming 2025–2026 academic year, along with new weekly class schedules across all grade levels and the introduction of a nationwide Artificial Intelligence (AI) curriculum. These changes reflect a careful balance between improving academic delivery, supporting student well-being, and preparing future generations for a technology-driven world in line with Vision 2030.TL;DR:Most Saudi regions will begin school on August 24, 2025; schools in Makkah, Madinah, Jeddah, and Taif will start officially on August 31.The Ministry has released grade-wise weekly class/subject structures to optimize learning while supporting student wellbeing.All grades will experience hands-on, progressive AI modules, starting 2025–2026, to build national digital and analytical skills.Academic year start dates & staggered returnIn most regions, administrative staff and education supervisors resumed work on August 12, 2025, while teachers returned on August 17, with student classes starting on August 24. In high-density education hubs such as Makkah, Madinah, Jeddah, and Taif, the schedule is offset by one week: staff report on August 17, teachers on August 24, and students begin on August 31. This staggered approach aims to allow better coordination, facility readiness, and smoother student transitions in the busiest school zones.Weekly class structure by gradeThe Ministry’s updated timetable allocates 33 weekly periods (each period roughly 45 minutes) for Grades 1 to 6, with younger students covering eight subjects plus activity classes, and older elementary pupils covering ten subjects. Intermediate school students in Grades 7 and 8 have 35 periods with ten subjects, while Grade 9 students also have 35 periods but with an additional non-academic development component. Secondary school students under the General Track System have 32 periods per week, with subjects varying by semester and grade to accommodate advanced specialization while maintaining core learning standards. This shift is designed to sustain rigorous academics while creating room for sports, arts, and other student development programs.AI curriculum rollout: Building future skillsFor the first time in Saudi Arabia’s public education system, students in all grades will be taught artificial intelligence through age-appropriate, practical lessons. Developed in partnership between the National Curriculum Center, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, and the Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA), this program introduces AI concepts step-by-step, linking them to real-life applications. Hands-on projects encourage problem-solving, critical thinking, and creativity, while preparing students to participate in emerging technology sectors. The new curriculum builds on the success of previous high school AI pilots and directly supports Vision 2030’s Human Capability Development Program, aiming to position the Kingdom as a regional leader in digital talent.The 2025–2026 academic year marks a significant milestone for Saudi Arabia’s education system. With region-specific school start dates, an optimized class schedule, and the groundbreaking introduction of AI education from primary to secondary levels, these reforms are designed to modernize learning, promote student well-being, and equip young Saudis with the knowledge and skills to thrive in a rapidly changing, tech-driven global economy.FAQ1.
