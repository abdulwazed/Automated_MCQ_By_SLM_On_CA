File photo NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday paid tribute to victims who suffered during India's 1947 Partition on the Partition Horrors Remembrance Day, remembering the "upheaval and pain endured by countless people" after the unplanned partition.PM Modi said it's the day to honour the grit of people who faced "unimaginable loss and still find the strength to start afresh". "India observes #PartitionHorrorsRemembranceDay, remembering the upheaval and pain endured by countless people during that tragic chapter of our history. It is also a day to honour their grit...their ability to face unimaginable loss and still find the strength to start afresh," PM Modi wrote on X.PollDo you believe that remembering the Partition is important for India's unity?Yes, absolutelyNo, it's not necessaryThe PM further said: "Many of those affected went on to rebuild their lives and achieve remarkable milestones. This day is also a reminder of our enduring responsibility to strengthen the bonds of harmony that hold our country together."Union home minister Amit Shah said August 14 is the day to "remember and honour the pain of those who suffered the tragedy of Partition" and lashed out at the Congress party for dividing the nation -- calling it the dark chapter of history."Today is a day to remember and honour the pain of those who suffered the tragedy of Partition. On this day, the Congress divided the nation, wounding the pride of Mother India. Partition unleashed violence, exploitation, and atrocities, forcing millions to leave their homes. I offer my heartfelt tributes to all those who endured this suffering. The nation can never forget the history and anguish of Partition. I also pay homage to those who lost their lives in this dark chapter of our history," Shah wrote on X.Defence minister Rajnath Singh said: "Every Indian still carries a sense of compassion for those affected families. We remain fully committed to further strengthening social harmony in the country.""I pay tribute to all those brothers and sisters who endured the horrific consequences of hatred and violence following India’s Partition in 1947, and who suffered the loss of lives and property," he wrote on X. External affairs minister S Jaishankar also said that the partition caused "immense suffering and had far-reaching human and strategic consequences.""On #PartitionHorrorsRemembranceDay, we recall the resilience of those who endured this terrible tragedy. There are many lessons to be learnt from this painful chapter," the minister wrote on X.The horror of partitionThe Partition of India in 1947, which created the separate nations of India and Pakistan, was one of the most defining and traumatic events in South Asian history. Born out of political deadlock between the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League, and hastened by the British decision to leave, the division was drawn hastily along religious lines by the Radcliffe Commission. The result triggered one of the largest human migrations in history, with around 14–18 million people crossing borders -- Hindus and Sikhs moving to India, Muslims to Pakistan. The upheaval unleashed horrific communal violence, massacres, abductions, and sexual assaults, leaving more than a million dead and countless others scarred for life. Entire trains of refugees were attacked, villages were wiped out, and families were torn apart overnight. To ensure the memory of this tragedy endures, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2021 declared August 14 as Partition Horrors Remembrance Day (Vibhajan Vibhishika Smriti Diwas). The day is marked with tributes to victims, exhibitions, archival displays, and public messages reflecting on the human cost of Partition, with leaders urging unity and a commitment to never let such divisions and bloodshed occur again.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
