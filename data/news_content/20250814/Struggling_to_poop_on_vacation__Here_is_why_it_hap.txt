Travel-related stress together with feelings of anxiety stemming from plan changes and new environment, causes bowel function to slow down  Have you ever noticed that when you are traveling, your bowel habits go for a toss, even if you never have the issue at home? Travelers commonly experience constipation, which doctors refer to as traveler's constipation. Your digestive system reacts differently to the changes in your daily routine when you travel, thus causing this condition. But how can we fix it? Let's dig deeper...What is traveler’s constipationWhen traveling, most people experience constipation which includes either difficult stool passage, or infrequent bowel movements. The regular bowel movements that people experience usually at home, become disrupted during their travel periods. When traveling, the digestive system operates at a reduced speed, to produce tough and dry stools that become difficult to pass through the body. Most individuals experience this condition temporarily for the first few days of travel, and then it resumes back to normal. However, the condition can result in discomfort and pain that needs proper management.Why does traveler’s constipation happenMultiple elements work together to create constipation issues among travelers. Just like our body, our bowels, too, need a routine. The disruption of daily routines, alters your body's natural circadian rhythm which controls both digestion and bowel movements. Your digestive system experiences disruption because you travel between time zones, and eat at irregular times, and sleep differently than usual.Another major factor is dehydration. Airplane cabins contain dry air, and travelers usually do not consume enough water during flight, or even on the go, while sightseeing. When people do not get enough fluids in their body, the stool turns hard, which makes it hard to pass through the digestive system.Other factorsDiet too, plays a huge role. During your travels, you probably consume more processed food and heavy meals, alongside fewer vegetables and less fiber than you normally would. A diet with insufficient fiber content, leads to delayed digestion which results in constipation.Your intestines need movement to function properly, but travelers spend most of their time inactive during flights and car rides which worsens this condition. Travel-related stress together with feelings of anxiety stemming from plan changes and new environment, causes bowel function to slow down.Symptoms of traveler’s constipationTravelers who experience constipation usually show these typical symptoms:Having fewer than three bowel movements per weekThe stool becomes extremely hard and dry, while causing discomfort or difficulties during bowel movements.Fullness or bloating after eating, or after visiting the bathroom.Straining or pain during bowel movements.The mentioned symptoms produce mild discomfort, but usually do not pose significant threats to health. Medical help should be sought when constipation continues beyond a normal period, or when accompanied by intense pain or bloody stools.How to fix traveler’s constipationHere are some ways to fix this condition:1. Throughout your entire trip, you should consume lots of water because it will make your stools softer. Consuming large amounts of caffeine and alcohol should be avoided, since they have a dehydrating effect.2. Your diet should contain fruits and vegetables, together with whole grains and legumes, as these foods are high in fiber. The fiber content in your diet creates volume in your stool, which leads to regular bowel movements.3. Light walking and other forms of physical exercise will help activate your digestive system to relieve constipation.4. The practice of relaxation techniques which includes deep breathing and meditation, will help you manage stress because it affects digestion.5. You should never delay passing stools because this behavior will worsen your constipation symptoms. You should stick to your regular bathroom schedule while traveling.After consulting your doctor, you can consume supplements or laxatives when traveling.SourcesWhen Travel Stops You Up | Needham Gastroenterology AssociatesWhy You Get Constipated While Traveling - Cleveland ClinicHow can a person manage and prevent travel constipation? - Medical News TodayTraveler's Constipation: A Prospective Cohort StudyDisclaimer: This article is informational only and not a substitute for medical advice"Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie Coolie and War 2."About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.
