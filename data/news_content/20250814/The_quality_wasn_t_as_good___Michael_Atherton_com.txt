One team on the rise, one great team on the decline, an emerging team with absolutely great players at the top of their game,” Atherton said on Sky Sports Cricket. He explained that while 2005 set an unmatched benchmark, this latest series stood out for its unpredictable nature. “I’d probably put this one as the best since ’05 because of those dramatic moments — like Chris Woakes, and Rishabh Pant, and the way the series twisted and turned. So I reckon it’s probably the best series I’ve covered since ’05,” he added.IND vs ENG: Mohammed Siraj reflects on memorable win at The Oval The five-match contest ended 2-2 after India sealed a tense victory in the final Test at The Oval. The last day saw wickets fall quickly and emotions run high in a fiercely fought battle between the two sides.

That series remains remembered for its high-quality cricket, nail-biting finishes and lasting impact on the sport.PollWhich series do you think had more dramatic moments?2025 India-England Series2005 Ashes SeriesWhile Atherton’s verdict doesn't place the series on par or better than the 2005 Ashes, he still placed the India-England clash in elite company.
