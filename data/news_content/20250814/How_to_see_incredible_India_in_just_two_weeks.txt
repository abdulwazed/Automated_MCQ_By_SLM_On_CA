So, the ambitious dream of “seeing all of India,”  will be about a carefully curated itinerary with all the samples of colour, chaos, and charm. No itinerary will be perfect for such an epic trip, but this is how we are planning. If you have better ideas, do share with us, and we would not mind taking one or two detours on the way.2/9Fly into the Golden TriangleStart with Delhi, Agra, and Jaipur, which is often referred to as the holy trinity of first-time India trips. When in Delhi, include Mughal forts, trendy cafés, and popular markets for sure. Then head to Agra for the must-do Taj Mahal visit that will make you feel like you are in a dream. Next up is Jaipur’s palaces, pink-hued streets, and auto-rickshaw rides that will make you believe in colour therapy.3/9Try overnight trainsWhy waste precious sightseeing hours? India’s overnight trains will be a surprising and effective time-saving hack, but only if you plan it well in advance, as getting confirmed tickets can be a task at times, depending on the destination you choose.  Book AC 2-tier for a comfy-ish sleep, and you’ll wake up in a whole new city.4/9Mix metro cities with small towns For maximum coverage, don’t just city-hop. Balance the bustle of Mumbai or Kolkata with quieter, character-packed towns. Like for example Pushkar’s camel markets, Hampi’s boulder-strewn ruins, or Puducherry’s pastel French quarters. India’s small towns are sometimes the most charming surprises that you might not have expected.5/9Pick your mountains or beaches (or you can do both)Two weeks means tough choices. If you crave crisp air and Himalayan views, head north to Manali or Rishikesh. If your idea of bliss involves coconut trees and lazy sunsets, Kerala’s backwaters and Goa’s beaches will deliver. Trying to do both might be a hectic schedule, which will be tempting but ill-advised.6/9Say yes to street food, but with cautionYou’re not truly seeing India until you’ve eaten something from a cart that’s been parked in the same spot since the ’80s. Delhi’s chaat, Kolkata’s kathi rolls, Mumbai’s vada pav, each is a flavour explosion.7/9Follow the art of half-dayForget “one day per city.” In India, a half-day can fit a sunrise temple visit, a chaotic market, a street food lunch, and still leave you time to catch a train. The trick? Early mornings and ruthless prioritising. Pick 2–3 must-sees if you want to cover more in less time.8/9Use domestic flightsIndia is huge. So, domestic flights should be your pick if you need to travel from Jaipur to Kochi or Varanasi to Goa without losing two days on the road. There are budget airlines, and you can score budget tickets if you book early.9/9End with a ‘slow day’Your last 24 hours shouldn’t be a mad dash. Pick one city to just be. Maybe it’s watching the Ganga aarti in Varanasi, drifting on a Kerala houseboat, or sipping chai on a Goan balcony. Let the noise fade, and let the country sink in. India isn’t just about what you see, it’s about how it lingers with you.Follow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous​Jyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunning​indiaCelebrating 79th Independence Day: 10 slogans that inspired India’s freedom movement​indiaGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalindiaIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiindiaAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameindiaLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietindiaBirthday Special: Spine-chilling quotes of Alfred Hitchcock that will keep you up at nightindia10 baby names that mean creativity and visionindiaSet up a mini lotus pond at home with these easy tipsindia Next123 Photostories  Seeds that supercharge muscle growth and overall healthNAFLD in kids: Harvard-trained doctor explains why this silent liver disease is on the riseFrom Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leavesFrom Cristiano Ronaldo’s million-dollar sparkler to Arjun Tendulkar’s intimate proposal: Celebrity engagements that created buzz in 2025Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 symptoms of Liver disease that can be seen on hands and feet5 expensive animal-shaped bags that’ll leave you almost shocked!Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowComplaining all the time?
