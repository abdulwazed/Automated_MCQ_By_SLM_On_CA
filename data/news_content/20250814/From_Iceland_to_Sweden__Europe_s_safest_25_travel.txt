And if safety has been one of your concerns that has made you push back your plans, it’s time to put those worries at rest. You can say hello to peace of mind on your next trip! From Iceland’s glacier-kissed calm to Portugal’s sun-soaked streets, Europe’s safest countries serve up scenic views with zero stress. (Data sourced from Data Pandas)Safety isn’t just about locking doors or avoiding sketchy alleyways,it’s a lifestyle, a mood, and indeed matters wherever you are, especially when you are travelling. As such, the Global Peace Index (GPI), compiled by the Institute for Economics & Peace, ranks countries based on three pillars: societal safety and security, ongoing domestic and international conflicts, and the level of militarisation, can serve as a point of reference when planning that long-awaited trip. Read on to find the safest places on the list.Topping Europe’s safest list is Iceland, scoring 1.107, and that is because of Iceland’s longstanding stability, minimal crime rates, and cohesive society make it a haven for peace seekers.Next up is Ireland with a score of 1.288, where cordial international relations and progressive policies help the Emerald Isle maintain its low-crime, high-peace reputation. Then come the usual suspects for Nordic serenity: Denmark (1.296), Austria (1.300), and Portugal (1.301). If you like your peace served with scenic fjords or sunlit coastlines, these countries check all the boxes.Read more: How to see incredible India i just 2 weeksRounding out the top ten are Slovenia (1.316) and the Czech Republic (1.318)—perfect blends of cultural heritage, modern governance, and safe streets. Switzerland isn’t far behind at 1.357, living up to its “politically stable and secure” reputation. Hungary (1.411) and Finland (1.439) complete the top ten, showing that both Central Europe and the Nordic north have mastered the art of peace.Patterns and trendsA clear trend emerges: Western Europe and Nordic nations dominate the safety charts, consistently scoring high on GPI, thanks to strong institutions, social trust, and political stability. Meanwhile, Eastern European and Eurasian countries tend to occupy the lower rungs, reflecting regional disparities in security and conflict levels. Notably, countries like Ukraine (2.971) and Russia (3.275) scored significantly lower, highlighting heightened instability relative to their western neighbors.Read more: Temples, Taj, and Thar: An epic 15-day adventure in the heart of North IndiaThis geographic divergence paints a picture of Europe as a continent of contrasts: idyllic, safe havens in the west and north, coupled with regions still grappling with security challenges in the east.These safety scores aren’t just numbers, they’re travel guides, lifestyle indicators, and sometimes, reassurance that your dream European adventure won’t require constant vigilance.
