Everyday Health reports that seemingly harmless habits can unexpectedly raise glucose levels. Skipping breakfast, hormonal changes, inactivity, stress, infections, certain medications, poor sleep, and gum disease are key culprits. Monitoring blood glucose alongside daily activities helps identify triggers, enabling better management and reducing diabetes-related complications.  Managing blood sugar levels is vital for living well with type 2 diabetes. While diet and medication are key, everyday habits can also significantly impact blood glucose control. Factors such as stress, sleep quality, physical activity, and even oral health can cause unexpected blood sugar spikes. These hidden triggers may disrupt your efforts, even when you’re following your treatment plan carefully. By understanding how these daily habits affect blood sugar, you can make smarter choices to improve control, reduce fluctuations, and lower the risk of diabetes-related complications over time. Awareness is the first step to better management.8 surprising causes of high blood sugarAccording to Everyday Health, these everyday habits could unexpectedly increase your blood sugar levels and affect diabetes management.1. Skipping breakfastMissing breakfast may seem harmless, but for people with type 2 diabetes, it can cause blood sugar levels to remain elevated throughout the day. Skipping this important meal may impair the function of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, making it harder to regulate glucose after subsequent meals.2. Hormonal changes during menstruationFor women, hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle can lead to noticeable blood sugar swings. Increased levels of oestrogen and progesterone around ovulation and just before the period can make blood sugar harder to manage. Tracking your cycle alongside your blood glucose readings can help anticipate these changes and adjust treatment accordingly.3. Physical inactivityRegular exercise enhances insulin sensitivity and helps cells absorb glucose for energy. Conversely, even a few days of reduced physical activity can cause blood sugar levels to rise. Incorporating consistent movement into your routine is key for maintaining good glucose control and reducing reliance on medications.4. Stress and cortisolStress triggers the release of cortisol, a hormone that can increase blood sugar by reducing insulin sensitivity. Both mental and physical stressors, such as work pressure, relationship issues, or injury, can cause unexpected spikes in glucose. Learning stress management techniques like deep breathing or short walks can help mitigate these effects.5. Infections and illnessWhen your body fights infection, it produces stress hormones that can raise blood sugar levels. This inflammatory response makes it harder to keep glucose in check, which is why sick days require special attention. Discuss with your healthcare provider how to monitor and manage your blood sugar during illness.6. Certain medications and supplementsVarious prescribed drugs and over-the-counter supplements can influence blood sugar. Always inform your doctor about any new medications or supplements to assess their potential impact on your diabetes management.7. Poor sleep qualityLack of sufficient sleep is linked to elevated stress hormones and reduced insulin production. Sleep deprivation can also increase hunger hormones, making dietary control more challenging. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep nightly to support stable blood sugar levels.8. Gum disease and oral healthEmerging research highlights a two-way relationship between diabetes and gum disease. Poor dental health can increase systemic inflammation and infections, which in turn raise blood sugar levels. Good oral hygiene and regular dental visits are especially important for people managing type 2 diabetes.Managing unexpected blood sugar spikesAwareness is the first step to preventing unexpected blood sugar increases. Keep a detailed log of your blood glucose readings along with notes on your activities, stress levels, sleep patterns, and medication changes. This information can help your healthcare team identify triggers and adjust your treatment plan effectively.Also read | How gout increases your risk of developing type 2 diabetes: Know the link between the twoAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.
