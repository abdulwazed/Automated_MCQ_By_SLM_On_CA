It becomes the highest-grossing Indian animated film. The film earns Rs 138.75 crore in India within 20 days. It surpasses several Bollywood blockbusters. Positive word of mouth and strong visuals fuel its success. The film's performance paves the way for future installments. It proves the potential of Indian animation.  In a historic milestone for Indian animation,Ashwin Kumar’s Mahavatar Narsimha has officially entered the list of the Top 80 highest-grossing Hindi films of all time, overtaking some of Bollywood’s most successful live-action blockbusters. The Ashwin Kumar directorial, the first installment in the ambitious seven-part Mahavatar Cinematic Universe, has grossed Rs 138.75 crore in India in just 20 days, edging past Varun Dhawan’s Judwaa 2 (Rs 138.55 crore), Ayushmann Khurrana’s Badhaai Ho (Rs 137.31 crore), and Akshay Kumar’s Toilet: Ek Prem Katha (Rs 134.42 crore).What makes this achievement even more remarkable is that Mahavatar Narsimha is an Indian animated film, while animation as a genre has found success but Indian animation has been on par with its international counterparts.  Not only has Mahavatar Narsimha broken that long-standing barrier, it is now the highest-grossing Indian animated film ever, setting a benchmark that future productions in the space will aspire to match.PollDo you think Mahavatar Narsimha's success will inspire more animated films in India?YesNoThe film’s box office journey has been nothing short of extraordinary. Opening with a modest Rs 1.35 crore on Day 1, Mahavatar Narsimha picked up pace quickly, fueled by positive word of mouth, stunning visuals, and a storyline deeply rooted in Indian mythology. The first major boost came over the weekend, with collections like Rs 3.25 crore (Day 2), Rs 6.8crore (Day 3), with week 1 collection in Hindi ending at Rs 32.45 crore. The film in week 2 saw a bigger jump than week 1 where it minted Rs 54.95 crore from it’s Hindi version.The combination of high-quality animation, compelling voice performances, and deep rooted emotions that blended epic orchestration with devotional undertones created a cinematic experience that appealed across age groups.The film’s success also lays the groundwork for the upcoming installments of the Mahavatar Cinematic Universe, a planned seven-part animated epic chronicling the avatars of Lord Vishnu.For now, Mahavatar Narsimha has not just made history for animation in India it has proved that strong storytelling, rooted in culture but presented with modern technology, can rival and even surpass mainstream Bollywood entertainers.Also the film was expected to experience a drop in it’s collection thanks to the release of Rajinikanth’s Coolie and Hrithik Roshan-Jr NTR’s War 2 taking up most of the screens but muted response to War 2 can make space for Mahavtar Narsimha thus giving a major push to its collection of Rs 185.50 across multiple languages .
