Rahul Dravid bhai had come to play and scored 199 runs. That night, we went to dinner at someone's house. India’s match was going on that day, and Sachin paaji was batting. He was playing a run-a-ball innings. We were both sitting on the side, and people were saying, ‘Sachin should play a little faster.’ But he was playing according to the situation of the match. Rahul bhai whispered in my ear, ‘If they are saying so much to him, then how much would they have said to me?’” Singh recounted.Nicknamed “The Wall” for his rock-solid technique, Dravid was renowned for his patient batting style, often testing the resolve of bowlers and fans alike.
