Waking up at 5:30/6:00am to move my body when my bed was so hard, because that’s when the sleep was sweetest, But those early workouts gave me consistency and discipline, especially with staying committed to my required daily calorie deficit meal plan. Exercising early gave me an automatic energy boost to start my day right."4/11Intermittent fasting"I constantly made sure and was intentional with intermittent fasting detoxing 2-3 days a week, even on days I did not feel like , I made a rule to always include 2-3 days fruit/detox fast, this helped with snatching my waist line."5/11No to "night" outs"My friends didn’t always get it, but I knew my future self would thank me, and it will be all worth it and the end, and Yes it helped me from the endless cycle of having to restart my journey after overindulging whenever I went out. Staying inside helped me save my money and also lose more weight easily."6/11Need over want"This is a hard decision but I noticed, if I wait until I was really hungry before I had something to eat, I always end up over-Eating or excessively snacking later during the day, so I made a decision to eat when it’s my time to eat and not to keep pushing until I’m hungry and this helped eliminate cravings and I was always constantly satisfied with my daily meal portion, I stayed in a calorie deficit easily, and this is important to see results.”7/11Mental struggles“I learnt the hard way that losing weight is more mental than physical. The hardest part wasn’t my body, it was my mind telling me to quit. I had to fight the voice that said “It’s not worth it” and keep going anyway, I had to constantly remind myself that this is beyond weight loss, it's about a lifestyle change, maintaining a healthy body and breaking out of endless procrastination,” she said.8/11Consistency“Rain, cramps, bad mood, a bad day, and even on days when they scale decided to misbehave, I still showed up, even if it’s not 100 percent, because I know what matters is consistency, and to be honest, motivation didn’t get me results, discipline did.”9/11Patience“I’ll keep reminding myself that some weeks, my weight didn’t move at all, and I know it will hurt, but I’ll try my best to keep up showing up and pushing, trusting the process instead of letting frustration win and focusing on other ways of measuring my progress, like taking pictures and retaking my measurements,” she added.10/11Track, track and trackAmaka said tracking was annoying and time-consuming at first, 'but knowing exactly what went into her body kept her from lying to herself about my habits and food portions and helped her stay more on track'.11/11Divine intervention“This was less of a sacrifice. I constantly asked for help and strength from God daily to keep pushing, and he really failed me, because daily my strength failed me. He came through for me above my expectations, continuously renewed my strength, took control over my sugar cravings and blessed my hard work with amazing results.”These views are not generic in nature.
