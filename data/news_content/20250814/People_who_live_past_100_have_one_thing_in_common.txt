People who live past 100 have one thing in common, finds study
A Swedish study tracking older adults reveals that specific blood markers, related to metabolism, inflammation, and organ function, correlate with exceptional longevity. Future centenarians often exhibited healthier, balanced readings in their 60s, suggesting these biomarkers can predict who might live past 100. Maintaining these markers within healthy ranges through lifestyle and monitoring may improve long-term survival prospects.

Future centenarians often exhibited healthier, balanced readings in their 60s, suggesting these biomarkers can predict who might live past 100. Maintaining these markers within healthy ranges through lifestyle and monitoring may improve long-term survival prospects.  What makes some people live to see a full century while others don’t? According to a Swedish study published in GeroScience by researchers from the Karolinska Institute, a surprisingly simple clue may lie within the body, distinguishing future centenarians from the rest of the population. Researchers tracked tens of thousands of older adults over several decades, observing patterns that hinted at exceptional longevity long before participants reached 100. While genetics, diet, exercise, and lifestyle factors continue to influence lifespan, the study found a consistent pattern in certain blood markers that strongly correlated with living past a century. These findings offer an intriguing glimpse into the biological secrets behind extraordinary longevity and could help guide future research on healthy aging.Key biomarkers linked to living past 100 The study analysed twelve blood markers connected to metabolism, inflammation, kidney and liver function, malnutrition, and anaemia. Researchers found that people who eventually reached 100 tended to have healthier, more balanced readings even in their 60s, suggesting that these biomarkers can provide early signals of exceptional longevity.Lower levels observed in future centenarians included:Glucose (blood sugar)Creatinine (kidney function)Uric acid (inflammation)AST/ALT (liver enzymes)Alkaline phosphatase (liver and bone health)Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, tissue damage)Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC, nutrition status)Higher levels observed included:IronTotal cholesterolResearchers noted that the readings of future centenarians were rarely extreme. Instead, most had moderate, stable values, highlighting that a balance in these biomarkers, rather than unusually high or low figures, may be key to longevity. Interestingly, these patterns were remarkably consistent across individuals, suggesting a common physiological profile among those who achieve exceptional age.The findings also suggest that maintaining these markers within healthy ranges may reflect both genetic advantages and lifestyle factors, such as a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and effective management of chronic health conditions. This early physiological advantage, evident even decades before reaching 100, underscores the importance of midlife health as a foundation for long-term survival.How these markers can predict longevityAll but two of the twelve biomarkers were found to have predictive power for reaching 100. Low iron or very low cholesterol appeared to reduce the likelihood, while stable kidney and liver markers, low uric acid, and low-normal blood glucose were strong indicators of longevity. Subtle differences in these measurements were often evident decades before the 100th birthday, highlighting the value of routine blood tests as a tool for assessing long-term survival prospects.Health and lifestyle in the journey to 100Many future centenarians already displayed fewer chronic conditions and healthier overall profiles by their 60s. This suggests that both genetics and lifestyle factors—such as diet, exercise, and preventive healthcare—play important roles. Women represented roughly 85% of those who reached 100, reflecting broader global longevity trends. The combination of healthy blood markers and fewer health issues in midlife appears to set the stage for exceptional longevity.What it means for the rest of usThe study’s findings hint at a practical takeaway: monitoring and managing key physiological markers can offer insight into long-term survival prospects. Paying attention to glucose, cholesterol, iron, inflammation, and kidney and liver health—even later in life—may improve the odds of reaching a century. While genetics still matters, lifestyle and regular health monitoring appear to provide a real opportunity to influence how long and how well we live.About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.
