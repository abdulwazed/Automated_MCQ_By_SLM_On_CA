NEW DELHI: Supreme Court prima facie disagreed on Wednesday with the argument that the Election Commission had no authority to conduct an intensive revision of electoral rolls and observed that it was within the sole domain of the poll panel to decide when and how to conduct the exercise. A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi also said that the SIR being conducted in Bihar is voter friendly and not exclusionary.The bench's remark came when senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for Association for Democratic Reforms, excoriated EC for conducting an "unconstitutional" exercise at its whims and fancies to "delete" voters from the draft Bihar electoral rolls. This also led the justices to emphasise that election laws and rules leave it to the EC's discretion to devise the procedure for conducting SIR for any constituency.Rahul Gandhi Doubles Down On 'Vote Chori' Allegations, Oppn MPs Protest In Parliament Over Bihar SIR"It is the exclusive prerogative of EC to decide how and when to conduct special revision of electoral rolls," the bench said, adding that if there are irregularities or errors in the procedure of conducting SIR in Bihar, it would seek a response from EC and correct it, if needed.PollShould the voter list be static or revised periodically?It should be static.It should be revised periodically."EC has not undone the entire voter list. It has taken the 2003 voter list as a milestone and presumes pre-existence of voters," the bench said.SC: Voter list can't be static, must be revised periodically It can't be argued that there is complete absence of power with EC to conduct special revision of electoral rolls. The law says it can be done constituency-wise and in such a manner as EC deems proper," the bench said.West Bengal, through senior advocates Sankaranarayanan and Kalyan Banerjee, raised the issue of SIR being conducted without mandatory consultation with state govt. The bench said the state's challenge to SIR can wait till the adjudication of the petition against the revision of Bihar's electoral rolls.Senior advocate A M Singhvi attempted to persuade the court to allow the 2003 list, with additions as of the last general elections, to be the electoral roll for the upcoming Bihar elections. "No one is against SIR, if it is conducted in Dec 2025 and the exercise takes a year," he said.The bench disagreed. "Instead of seven documents specified earlier for revision of electoral rolls, EC has expanded it to 11 documents. It shows the exercise is voter friendly and not exclusionary," said the justices.Singhvi said the documents, apart from Aadhaar, ration card and voter ID card, are available only with a minuscule percentage.Sankaranarayanan argued that the right to be included in an electoral roll is a constitutional right if a person did not suffer any of the specified disqualifications. The bench said, "The voter list cannot be static. It must be revised periodically."Advocate Prashant Bhushan said, "I can give guarantee that not more than 25% of the over 7 crore people who submitted enumeration forms have not submitted any document supporting their nationality. Booth-level officers, as per whims and fancies, have not recommended a whopping 10% to 12% of people in... Darbhanga and Kaimur for inclusion in the voter list."He said EC had put the draft voter list on its website after Aug 1 but removed it on Aug 4 after Rahul Gandhi held a press conference about "voter manipulation". SC said, "We do not know of any such press conference."Senior advocate Shadan Farasat said the names of 65 lakh deleted from the draft voter list must be restored. SC said, "We cannot bring the dead back and make them vote." Arguments will continue on Thursday.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousZodiac signs who are known for their simplicityastrologyDipika Kakar’s top 10 gorgeous ethnic looks for festive seasontvJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Movies that made us question everything we thought we knewSara Tendulkar’s protein drinks: How to make them and their benefitsWhy is the Peepal tree worshipped in India5 early symptoms of Diabetes in men that should not be ignoredCardiologist says these blood tests that can predict heart disease risks even before symptoms appearTemples, Taj, and Thar: An epic 15-day adventure in the heart of North IndiaThis is how cooking meat may increase the risk of cancerFrom bullied schoolboy to ₹3,000 crore superstar – Hrithik Roshan’s inspiring journeyHow to see incredible India in just two weeksSeeds that supercharge muscle growth and overall health123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillVanessa BryantDwyane WadeKyrie lrvingNHL Trade RumorsRaj KundraCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteWatch: Meghalaya boy riding horse to school, faithful dog trots along;
