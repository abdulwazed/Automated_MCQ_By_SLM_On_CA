BLA labelled foreign terrorist org as Trump plans to develop Pakistan's 'huge oil reserves'
Despite its SDGT designation in 2019, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) recently faced FTO scrutiny, coinciding with US interest in Balochistan's resources. Trump's plans for oil reserves with Pakistan and visits from associates exploring mineral deals have fueled speculation. The BLA's Majeed Brigade, known for attacks against Pakistani and Chinese interests, has intensified its actions since 2018.

Trump's plans for oil reserves with Pakistan and visits from associates exploring mineral deals have fueled speculation. The BLA's Majeed Brigade, known for attacks against Pakistani and Chinese interests, has intensified its actions since 2018.  Despite being designated as Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) in 2019, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) surprisingly evaded being labelled as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) until now. However, the US state department's sudden interest in the rebel group, particularly its subsidiary Majeed Brigade, has raised eyebrows and sparked curiosity about possible motivations.The development comes close on the heels of US President Donald Trump announcing his plans to develop 'massive oil reserves' with Pakistan. The announcement attracted a response from Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch, who said that reserves of oil, natural gas, copper, lithium, uranium and rare earths were not located in actual Pakistan and belonged to "Republic of Balochistan". Baloch wrote an open letter to Trump warning him that he was misled about "massive oil reserves" in Pakistan by army chief Asim Munir.The visits to Pakistan by Gentry Beach, a close college friend of President Trump's son Donald Trump Jr, have also piqued curiosity, with the latter seeing a potential to cut deals worth billions of dollars in explorations of rare earth minerals, oil and gas, and real estate. A recent deal that Pakistan negotiated with World Liberty Financial (WLF), a cryptocurrency venture in which the Trump family has a 60% stake, has also fuelled speculation.Though it had its roots founded in the 70s, the Majeed Brigade was a little-known entity until a decade ago. The brigade comprises fidayeen (suicide bombers) who have been fighting the Pakistan-China collaboration opposed to its freedom struggle. "It was in the 1970s that Abdul Majeed Baloch carried out a failed assassination bid on Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the former Pakistan PM who dismissed the National Awami Party's govt in Balochistan," recalled a source.However, it was in 2010-11 that the brigade was formally constituted in the memory of Abdul Majeed. Since then, the brigade has carried out numerous suicide attacks against Pakistani security forces and Chinese nationals working for China-Pakistan Economic Corridor projects in Balochistan and Sindh. The attacks have intensified since 2018. Their most lethal hit was on the Jaffar Express, in which BLA claimed it eliminated 214 Pak military personnel.About the AuthorRaj Shekhar JhaRaj Shekhar Jha is a journalist for the Times of India with over a decade of experience in reporting on national security, terrorism, crime and prisons.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Seeds that supercharge muscle growth and overall healthFrom Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leavesTop 5 Getaways in North and South India to Work RemotelyFrom Cristiano Ronaldo’s million-dollar sparkler to Arjun Tendulkar’s intimate proposal: Celebrity engagements that created buzz in 2025Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 expensive animal-shaped bags that’ll leave you almost shocked!Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;
