She acknowledged his role in delivering justice concerning her husband Raju Pal's murder. She credited Adityanath's zero-tolerance policy for the action against Atiq Ahmed, the accused in the 2005 killing. She highlighted the sense of trust the state now has in the Chief Minister.  Samajwadi Party MLA Pooja Pal NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party MLA Pooja Pal on Thursday thanked Uttar Pradesh chief ministerYogi Adityanath for bringing her justice, saying he had “buried” dreaded gangster Atiq Ahmed, who was behind the killing of her husband, Raju Pal.She said CM Yogi's "zero-tolerance policy" against crime delivered justice in the 2005 murder of her husband, who was the BSP MLA."Everyone knows who murdered my husband (Raju Pal). I want to thank the chief minister for bringing me justice and hearing me when nobody else did,” she said during the 24-hour marathon debate on Vision Document 2047. “The CM gave justice to many other women like me in Prayagraj by bringing in policies like zero tolerance that led to the killing of criminals like Atiq Ahmed. Today, the entire state looks at the CM with trust.”She added, “Mere pati ke hatyare Atiq Ahmed ko Mukhya Mantri ne mitti mein milaane ka kaam kiya” (The chief minister has buried my husband’s murderer Atiq Ahmed).Pooja Pal said she raised her voice when no one was ready to stand up to criminals like Atiq Ahmed. “When I started getting exhausted with this fight, CM Yogi Adityanath gave me justice,” she told the House.Raju Pal was shot dead in Prayagraj in 2005, days after his wedding. The main accused, gangster-politician Atiq Ahmed, faced trial for years without a final verdict. In February 2023, Umesh Pal, a key witness in the case, was killed in a daylight attack in Prayagraj’s Sulem Saray area. Several rounds were fired and crude bombs hurled at Umesh and his gunners.The killings reignited pressure on the state’s crackdown against organised crime. Atiq Ahmed and his brother Ashraf were later arrested. On April 15, 2023, both were shot dead by assailants posing as journalists while being escorted for a medical check-up in Prayagraj.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Activists of the left parties take part in a protest rally against alleged illegal detention and torture of Bengali-speaking migrant workers, in Kolkata (PTI photo) NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) concerning the detention and alleged torture of Bengali-speaking migrant workers under suspicion of being Bangladeshi nationals.However, Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi declined to issue an interim order regarding the detentions, listing the matter for next week; noting that such decisions would have implications, particularly for individuals who have entered from neighbouring countries.'Nazi' BJP Targeting 'Bengalis': TMC MP Mahua Moitra's Explosive Interview On Gurugram Crackdown"States where these migrant workers are working have the right to inquire from their state of origin about their bonafide but the problem is in the interregnum. If we pass any interim orders, then it will have consequences, especially those who have illegally come from across the border and need to be deported under the law," the bench said, as quoted by PTI.The top court told advocate Prashant Bhushan, representing the West Bengal Migrant Welfare Board, to await responses from the Central government and nine states: Odisha, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Delhi, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana and West Bengal.The case centres around individuals allegedly facing harassment by states solely for speaking Bengali and possessing Bengali-language documents, following a Ministry of Home Affairs circular, as argued by Bhushan."They are being detained while an inquiry is being held about their bonafide and in some cases, they are even tortured. Kindly pass some interim order that no detention will be held. I have no problem with enquiries but there should not be any detention," the advocate said in his argument.The apex court, however, did acknowledge the necessity to establish procedures to protect legitimate citizens from harassment.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

A video of a schoolboy riding a horse to school while being accompanied by a dog has gone viral on social media. The footage, reportedly captured in Meghalaya's hilly terrain, shows the student in his school uniform traveling to school on horseback, with a black dog running alongside.The clip was shared on Instagram by the account 'twinklejoanna' and quickly captured the attention of social media users across platforms. "A casual ride to school," stated the original social media post describing the footage.The combination of the young student's unconventional commute and his faithful canine companion invoked numerous reactions from viewers online.The location appears to be the West Khasi Hills region near Nongstoin, though the exact location and authenticity of the footage could not be independently verified."We saw him Saturday. It's West khasi hills right? Near nongstoin," commented a user, attempting to identify the location."A horse as a ride and a dog to see him off. The coolest guy," said another social media user.The unusual sight of a horse being used for school transportation led to humorous speculation about the school's facilities."I would like to see the parking lot of the school," remarked one curious viewer.Some users drew pop culture references from the scene."Phantom spotted, just in case anybody remembers the phantom," noted one commenter.The video particularly resonated with viewers, who appreciated the cultural aspects of Northeast India."Bro is the AURA himself. This just made my day honestly. People in NE know what they are doing," expressed an enthusiastic viewer.The presence of the dog following the horse and rider captured special attention from viewers."If only I could also go to my school on a horse, while my pet dog would have followed. Just amazing," shared one nostalgic commenter.The video presents a stark contrast to typical urban school commutes, highlighting the diverse transportation methods still prevalent in different parts of India.The footage has become what social media users term as 'aura farming,' referring to content that naturally generates significant online engagement and admiration.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The court heard arguments highlighting the severity of dog bite incidents and the need for a resolution, while also considering concerns about the removal of stray dogs from the streets and the lack of adequate shelter facilities.  NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday reserved the order on an interim prayer seeking a stay on the order by its two-judge bench over the stray dogs. While hearing, the apex court grilled the local authorities for their inaction, which led to severe problems.Huge uproar erupted after the August 11 order passed by Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan. Taking cognisance of the matter, Chief Justice B R Gavai withdrew the case and posted it for hearing on Thursday. "The whole problem is because of the inaction of local authorities," said the apex court during the hearing. Here are 10 takeaways from SC's hearing: SC's observationThe three-judge bench comprising Justices Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria reserved order on the interim prayer seeking a stay on the August 11 order of picking up strays from the streets of Delhi-NCR.The apex court grilled civic officials, saying, "The whole problem is because of the inaction of local authorities. Everyone who has filed an intervention will have to take responsibility."Children are dying, issue needs to be resolved, Delhi Govt tells SCDelhi government, during the hearing, told SC that the issue of stray dogs needs to be resolved and contested, adding that children are dying due to dog bites, causing rabies.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Delhi government, presented data before the bench saying, over 37 lakh reported dog bites in a year in the country. "Nobody is an animal hater," Mehta told the bench.Mehta told the Supreme Court that it is a contest between a vocal minority vs a silent majority who are suffering because of dog bites.'Vocal minority vs silent majority'Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who was appearing for an NGO, asserted that the situation is "very serious" and the matter needed to be argued in depth.Sibal further sought a stay on the order passed by the apex court on August 11, directing the removal of stray dogs from streets.He asked, "Has the Municipal corporation built shelter homes for dogs? Have the dogs been sterilised? Now, the dogs are being picked up. However, the order states that once sterilised, the stray dogs should not be left out in the community."Singhvi also opposed the two-bench order, saying that dog bites exist, but there have been zero rabies deaths in Delhi this year. "Of course, dog bites are bad, but you cannot create a horror situation like this," he said.The apex court will decide whether the order passed by its division bench on the stray dog issue is to be stayed or not.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

'1 person 1 vote exists since 1951': EC slams Rahul Gandhi, oppn's use of term 'vote chori'; seeks proof
The Election Commission has strongly refuted Rahul Gandhi's "vote chori" allegations, deeming them an attack on Indian voters and election staff. Gandhi claimed widespread vote theft in Karnataka, citing duplicate entries and fake addresses. The ECI challenged Gandhi to provide evidence, but Gandhi insists the data is from the Election Commission itself, daring them to deny its accuracy.

Gandhi claimed widespread vote theft in Karnataka, citing duplicate entries and fake addresses. The ECI challenged Gandhi to provide evidence, but Gandhi insists the data is from the Election Commission itself, daring them to deny its accuracy. File photo NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Thursday hit back at Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi and other INDIA bloc parties over their repeated use of the term “vote chori,” saying such “dirty phrases” were aimed at creating a false narrative. The poll body called it a direct attack on crores of Indian voters and an assault on the integrity of lakhs of election staff.The ECI stressed that the “One Person, One Vote” law has been in place since India’s first elections in 1951-52. The poll body said anyone with proof of a person voting twice should submit it to the commission with a sworn affidavit, instead of branding all voters as “chor” without evidence.PollDo you think the current electoral process in India is transparent?YesNoOn August 7, Rahul Gandhi ran through a presentation at a press conference in New Delhi, where he alleged large-scale "vote chori" (vote theft) in Karnataka’s Mahadevapura assembly segment, claiming over 1 lakh votes were "stolen" through methods such as duplicate entries, fake addresses, and bulk registrations at single addresses. "Our internal polling predicted 16 Lok Sabha seats for Congress in Karnataka; we won nine. In Mahadevapura alone, we found 100,250 votes stolen in five different ways," Gandhi had said, presenting what he called Congress’s internal analysis of voting patterns.Later, the election commission asked Rahul Gandhi to submit a formal declaration supporting his "vote chori" (vote theft) claim, along with the names of electors allegedly wrongfully included in the voter list, in order to initiate necessary proceedings.Reacting to the election commission, Rahul said: "I'm saying it publicly to everybody. Take it as an oath. This is their data, and we are displaying their data. This is not our data". "Interestingly, they haven't denied the information," he further said. "I'm a politician. What I say to the people is my word. I'm saying it publicly to everybody. Take it as an oath. This is their data, and we are displaying their data. This is not our data. This is Election Commission data. Interestingly, they haven't denied the information. They haven't told the voter list that Rahul Gandhi is talking about are wrong. Why don't you say they wrong? Because you know the truth. You know that we know that you have done this across the country," the Congress leader told news agency ANI.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the court that steps are being taken but there are “peculiar situations” in the region."You cannot ignore what happened in Pahalgam... It is for Parliament and the Executive to take a decision," the CJI said.Mehta pointed out that assembly elections were held as promised to the Constitution Bench that had upheld the abrogation of Article 370 and the bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories. He added, “This is not the time for petitioners to muddy the waters.”PollWhat do you think is the most important factor in restoring statehood to Jammu and Kashmir?Ensuring regional security and stabilityProtecting democratic rights and developmentThe petition, filed last year by academician Zahoor Ahmad Bhat and socio-political activist Khurshaid Ahmad Malik, seeks directions to restore statehood within two months. It argues that keeping J&K as a Union Territory for nearly five years has weakened its democratic setup, caused “grave losses” to development, and hurt the rights of its citizens.The plea also says the delay violates the Supreme Court’s earlier directions to restore statehood “at the earliest and as soon as possible,” especially since assembly election results were declared on October 8, 2024.In its December 2023 verdict, the Supreme Court ruled that Article 370, which gave special status to J&K, was only a temporary provision. It held that the President had the power to revoke it after the state’s Constituent Assembly ceased to exist in 1957.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta highlighted the severity of dog bite incidents and rabies deaths, emphasizing the need for a solution balancing animal welfare and public safety. Senior advocates argued against the order to catch stray dogs, questioning the availability of shelter homes and sterilization efforts, as the court reserves its decision.  NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday reserved order on interim prayer seeking a stay on August 11 order of picking up strays from the streets. While lashing out, the apex court said that the problem of stray dogs has arisen "because of the inaction of civic authorities in implementing rules and laws." The SC will decide whether the order passed by its division bench on the stray dog issue is to be stayed or not.Delhi government told the Supreme Court that it has to intervene to check the menace of stray dogs in the country as the three-judge SC bench heard the matter.Vocal minority vs a silent majority Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said that it is a contest between a vocal minority vs a silent majority who are suffering because of dog bites.Mehta told the apex court that the situation is "very serious" and the matter needs to be argued in depth. He said that children are dying and sterilisation does not stop rabies, even if you immunise them. "That does not stop the mutilation of children," he added. Mehta presented a data before Supreme Court saying "37 lakhs dog bites reported in country in 2024. Rabies deaths were 305 deaths for the same year, WHO's modelling shows a much higher number. Nobody is an animal hater." He added that children are unable to go out to play in the open. "The court will have to find a solution. A vocal minority views as against the silent suffering majority view," he continued.Order has to be stayed, says SibalA batch of top senior advocates led by Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Kapil Sibal, who were present for the cause of stray dogs, pleaded to the SC that the court's order passed on Monday to catch stray dogs has to be stayed.Meanwhile, Sibal told SC that the August 11 order directing authorities in Delhi-NCR to start picking up stray dogs needs to be stayed.While seeking a stay, Sibal, who is appearing for an NGO, asked, "Has the Municipal corporation built shelter homes for dogs? Have the dogs been sterilised? Now, the dogs are being picked up. However, the order states that once sterilised, the stray dogs should not be left out in the community." Singhvi also opposed the August 11 order and said dog bites exist, but there have been zero rabies deaths in Delhi this year. "Of course, dog bites are bad, but you cannot create a horror situation like this," he added. Stray dog row   Earlier on Wednesday, Chief Justice B R Gavai withdrew the case from a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan and posted it for rehearing on Thursday before the three-judge special bench comprising Justices Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria. Gavai's announcement came after public outrage over the apex court's directive that it passed on Monday, ordering to removal of all stray dogs and putting them in shelters by Delhi government and civic bodies of Gurugram, Noida and Ghaziabad. The two-judge bench noted that there was an "extremely grim" situation due to stray dog bites resulting in rabies.

NEW DELHI: A parliamentary panel has flagged its concerns over the authenticity of data being fed into the Jal Jeevan Mission’s (JJM’s) Integrated Management Information System (IMIS), noting that the quality of uploaded information is essential to fill the visible gaps in the ambitious scheme of providing functional tap water connection to every rural household in the country.The panel -- standing committee on water resources headed by BJP Lok Sabha MP Rajiv Pratap Rudy -- in its report tabled in Parliament on Monday also noted the absence of annual assessment of the functionality of tap water connections in 2023.The annual assessment of functionality is vital to ensure long-term source and system sustainability and corrective measures by states/UTs based on its findings.PollIs the extension of the Jal Jeevan Mission deadline to 2028 a sign of progress or failure?Sign of progressSign of failure“Being aware of the fact that actual veracity of uploaded information is essential for realising the actual ground situation and filling the visible gaps, the Committee reiterate its recommendation that the department (of drinking water and sanitation) makes sincere efforts to ensure the authenticity of the data being fed on the IMIS,” said the report.While the panel observed that the department has cited a number of steps being taken by it for water quality monitoring and surveillance, it noted that the govt “has not furnished specific reply” on ascertaining the veracity of the information uploaded by the states/UTs on JJM-IMIS.On the panel’s observation over the absence of annual assessment, the govt, in its reply, told the committee that the department has received the final report of the functionality assessment survey.It said the department’s approval of the report is in final stages and will be released and shared with states shortly for requisite course correction.Launched in Aug 2019, the JJM was meant to cover all 19.32 crore (approx) rural households in the country by 2024. However, its deadline has now been extended to 2028.About the AuthorVishwa MohanVishwa Mohan is Senior Editor at The Times of India.

The day serves as a reminder of the human cost of division and the need to strengthen harmony. File photo NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday paid tribute to victims who suffered during India's 1947 Partition on the Partition Horrors Remembrance Day, remembering the "upheaval and pain endured by countless people" after the unplanned partition.PM Modi said it's the day to honour the grit of people who faced "unimaginable loss and still find the strength to start afresh". "India observes #PartitionHorrorsRemembranceDay, remembering the upheaval and pain endured by countless people during that tragic chapter of our history. It is also a day to honour their grit...their ability to face unimaginable loss and still find the strength to start afresh," PM Modi wrote on X.PollDo you believe that remembering the Partition is important for India's unity?Yes, absolutelyNo, it's not necessaryThe PM further said: "Many of those affected went on to rebuild their lives and achieve remarkable milestones. This day is also a reminder of our enduring responsibility to strengthen the bonds of harmony that hold our country together."Union home minister Amit Shah said August 14 is the day to "remember and honour the pain of those who suffered the tragedy of Partition" and lashed out at the Congress party for dividing the nation -- calling it the dark chapter of history."Today is a day to remember and honour the pain of those who suffered the tragedy of Partition. On this day, the Congress divided the nation, wounding the pride of Mother India. Partition unleashed violence, exploitation, and atrocities, forcing millions to leave their homes. I offer my heartfelt tributes to all those who endured this suffering. The nation can never forget the history and anguish of Partition. I also pay homage to those who lost their lives in this dark chapter of our history," Shah wrote on X.Defence minister Rajnath Singh said: "Every Indian still carries a sense of compassion for those affected families. We remain fully committed to further strengthening social harmony in the country.""I pay tribute to all those brothers and sisters who endured the horrific consequences of hatred and violence following India’s Partition in 1947, and who suffered the loss of lives and property," he wrote on X. External affairs minister S Jaishankar also said that the partition caused "immense suffering and had far-reaching human and strategic consequences.""On #PartitionHorrorsRemembranceDay, we recall the resilience of those who endured this terrible tragedy. There are many lessons to be learnt from this painful chapter," the minister wrote on X.The horror of partitionThe Partition of India in 1947, which created the separate nations of India and Pakistan, was one of the most defining and traumatic events in South Asian history. Born out of political deadlock between the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League, and hastened by the British decision to leave, the division was drawn hastily along religious lines by the Radcliffe Commission. The result triggered one of the largest human migrations in history, with around 14–18 million people crossing borders -- Hindus and Sikhs moving to India, Muslims to Pakistan. The upheaval unleashed horrific communal violence, massacres, abductions, and sexual assaults, leaving more than a million dead and countless others scarred for life. Entire trains of refugees were attacked, villages were wiped out, and families were torn apart overnight. To ensure the memory of this tragedy endures, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2021 declared August 14 as Partition Horrors Remembrance Day (Vibhajan Vibhishika Smriti Diwas). The day is marked with tributes to victims, exhibitions, archival displays, and public messages reflecting on the human cost of Partition, with leaders urging unity and a commitment to never let such divisions and bloodshed occur again.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

BLA labelled foreign terrorist org as Trump plans to develop Pakistan's 'huge oil reserves'
Despite its SDGT designation in 2019, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) recently faced FTO scrutiny, coinciding with US interest in Balochistan's resources.

Trump's plans for oil reserves with Pakistan and visits from associates exploring mineral deals have fueled speculation. The BLA's Majeed Brigade, known for attacks against Pakistani and Chinese interests, has intensified its actions since 2018.  Despite being designated as Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) in 2019, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) surprisingly evaded being labelled as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) until now. However, the US state department's sudden interest in the rebel group, particularly its subsidiary Majeed Brigade, has raised eyebrows and sparked curiosity about possible motivations.The development comes close on the heels of US President Donald Trump announcing his plans to develop 'massive oil reserves' with Pakistan. The announcement attracted a response from Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch, who said that reserves of oil, natural gas, copper, lithium, uranium and rare earths were not located in actual Pakistan and belonged to "Republic of Balochistan". Baloch wrote an open letter to Trump warning him that he was misled about "massive oil reserves" in Pakistan by army chief Asim Munir.The visits to Pakistan by Gentry Beach, a close college friend of President Trump's son Donald Trump Jr, have also piqued curiosity, with the latter seeing a potential to cut deals worth billions of dollars in explorations of rare earth minerals, oil and gas, and real estate. A recent deal that Pakistan negotiated with World Liberty Financial (WLF), a cryptocurrency venture in which the Trump family has a 60% stake, has also fuelled speculation.Though it had its roots founded in the 70s, the Majeed Brigade was a little-known entity until a decade ago. The brigade comprises fidayeen (suicide bombers) who have been fighting the Pakistan-China collaboration opposed to its freedom struggle. "It was in the 1970s that Abdul Majeed Baloch carried out a failed assassination bid on Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the former Pakistan PM who dismissed the National Awami Party's govt in Balochistan," recalled a source.However, it was in 2010-11 that the brigade was formally constituted in the memory of Abdul Majeed. Since then, the brigade has carried out numerous suicide attacks against Pakistani security forces and Chinese nationals working for China-Pakistan Economic Corridor projects in Balochistan and Sindh. The attacks have intensified since 2018. Their most lethal hit was on the Jaffar Express, in which BLA claimed it eliminated 214 Pak military personnel.About the AuthorRaj Shekhar JhaRaj Shekhar Jha is a journalist for the Times of India with over a decade of experience in reporting on national security, terrorism, crime and prisons.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Seeds that supercharge muscle growth and overall healthFrom Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leavesTop 5 Getaways in North and South India to Work RemotelyFrom Cristiano Ronaldo’s million-dollar sparkler to Arjun Tendulkar’s intimate proposal: Celebrity engagements that created buzz in 2025Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 expensive animal-shaped bags that’ll leave you almost shocked!Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

"This time I am not going to lose my cool," Justice Pardiwala said at the outset with a smile on his face. The case before it, in which an FIR was filed against a couple for not paying their dues to a seller, who lodged a complaint for recovery of the money, had been adjudicated by the Rajasthan high court. Granting anticipatory bail to the couple, the court said that litigants were forced to move the apex court for relief because proper law was not being applied by lower courts and high courts, which leads to unnecessary litigation and harassment of litigants. In this case, the couple had purchased plywood from a seller and paid Rs 3 lakh but then allegedly refused to pay the balance amount of Rs 12 lakh, making the seller file a case against them. tnnSC: A little application of mind by HCs will curb such litigation   The bench held that the problem of not following well-settled law was prevalent across the country and said a little application of mind by HCs would go a long way in curbing such litigation.Appearing against the couple, state govt questioned their conduct, as they had been on the run. The bench, however, said this could be because of the fear of police.The bench also disapproved of the stand of the public prosecutor before the HC, contending that it would not be possible to recover the money if bail was granted to the couple. "According to the state, police machinery is required to be involved in the recovery of money. Why do you want police to be involved for recovery of money - to squeeze the remaining amount for the seller?" it asked the advocate appearing for the state.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Seeds that supercharge muscle growth and overall healthFrom Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leavesTop 5 Getaways in North and South India to Work RemotelyFrom Cristiano Ronaldo’s million-dollar sparkler to Arjun Tendulkar’s intimate proposal: Celebrity engagements that created buzz in 2025Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 expensive animal-shaped bags that’ll leave you almost shocked!Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court prima facie disagreed on Wednesday with the argument that the Election Commission had no authority to conduct an intensive revision of electoral rolls and observed that it was within the sole domain of the poll panel to decide when and how to conduct the exercise. A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi also said that the SIR being conducted in Bihar is voter friendly and not exclusionary.The bench's remark came when senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for Association for Democratic Reforms, excoriated EC for conducting an "unconstitutional" exercise at its whims and fancies to "delete" voters from the draft Bihar electoral rolls. This also led the justices to emphasise that election laws and rules leave it to the EC's discretion to devise the procedure for conducting SIR for any constituency.Rahul Gandhi Doubles Down On 'Vote Chori' Allegations, Oppn MPs Protest In Parliament Over Bihar SIR"It is the exclusive prerogative of EC to decide how and when to conduct special revision of electoral rolls," the bench said, adding that if there are irregularities or errors in the procedure of conducting SIR in Bihar, it would seek a response from EC and correct it, if needed.PollShould the voter list be static or revised periodically?It should be static.It should be revised periodically."EC has not undone the entire voter list. It has taken the 2003 voter list as a milestone and presumes pre-existence of voters," the bench said.SC: Voter list can't be static, must be revised periodically It can't be argued that there is complete absence of power with EC to conduct special revision of electoral rolls. The law says it can be done constituency-wise and in such a manner as EC deems proper," the bench said.West Bengal, through senior advocates Sankaranarayanan and Kalyan Banerjee, raised the issue of SIR being conducted without mandatory consultation with state govt. The bench said the state's challenge to SIR can wait till the adjudication of the petition against the revision of Bihar's electoral rolls.Senior advocate A M Singhvi attempted to persuade the court to allow the 2003 list, with additions as of the last general elections, to be the electoral roll for the upcoming Bihar elections. "No one is against SIR, if it is conducted in Dec 2025 and the exercise takes a year," he said.The bench disagreed. "Instead of seven documents specified earlier for revision of electoral rolls, EC has expanded it to 11 documents. It shows the exercise is voter friendly and not exclusionary," said the justices.Singhvi said the documents, apart from Aadhaar, ration card and voter ID card, are available only with a minuscule percentage.Sankaranarayanan argued that the right to be included in an electoral roll is a constitutional right if a person did not suffer any of the specified disqualifications. The bench said, "The voter list cannot be static. It must be revised periodically."Advocate Prashant Bhushan said, "I can give guarantee that not more than 25% of the over 7 crore people who submitted enumeration forms have not submitted any document supporting their nationality. Booth-level officers, as per whims and fancies, have not recommended a whopping 10% to 12% of people in... Darbhanga and Kaimur for inclusion in the voter list."He said EC had put the draft voter list on its website after Aug 1 but removed it on Aug 4 after Rahul Gandhi held a press conference about "voter manipulation". SC said, "We do not know of any such press conference."Senior advocate Shadan Farasat said the names of 65 lakh deleted from the draft voter list must be restored. SC said, "We cannot bring the dead back and make them vote." Arguments will continue on Thursday.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousZodiac signs who are known for their simplicityastrologyDipika Kakar’s top 10 gorgeous ethnic looks for festive seasontvJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Movies that made us question everything we thought we knewSara Tendulkar’s protein drinks: How to make them and their benefitsWhy is the Peepal tree worshipped in India5 early symptoms of Diabetes in men that should not be ignoredCardiologist says these blood tests that can predict heart disease risks even before symptoms appearTemples, Taj, and Thar: An epic 15-day adventure in the heart of North IndiaThis is how cooking meat may increase the risk of cancerFrom bullied schoolboy to ₹3,000 crore superstar – Hrithik Roshan’s inspiring journeyHow to see incredible India in just two weeksSeeds that supercharge muscle growth and overall health123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillVanessa BryantDwyane WadeKyrie lrvingNHL Trade RumorsRaj KundraCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteWatch: Meghalaya boy riding horse to school, faithful dog trots along;

The direction was based on findings of an SC-constituted SIT, which gave a stinging report into the functioning of Noida Authority, finding, among other things, decision-making centralised in the hands of a few officers.Accepting SIT's recommendations, a bench of justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi ordered: "In order to infuse transparency and fairness as well as a citizen-centric approach in the day-to-day functioning of Noida, we direct UP chief secretary to place the recommendation... before the council of ministers for an appropriate decision."Till that decision is taken, the bench directed the chief secretary to post a chief vigilance officer, who should be an IPS officer or an officer on deputation from CAG, in Noida for a financial audit.According to SIT, Noida officers were involved in 20 cases of excess payment of compensation to landowners. Led by IPS officer SB Shiradkar, SIT also concluded that Noida's land allotment policies favour builders, and there was a lack of transparency and fairness in the development authority's overall functioning.Form citizen advisory board for Noida in 4 weeks: SC to UP government    It sought an inquiry into assets of officers and their relatives for a proper look at who benefited from excess compensation that Noida paid out.Commenting on the functioning of Noida, SIT said discretionary powers exercised by its officers in allotment of land is such that very soon, there will be no land available in Delhi's neighbouring city for future development purposes. It also flagged the lack of process to garner public view and conduct environment impact assessments for projects in Noida. SIT said residents often complain of delay and inadequate resolution of grievances, as Noida Authority acts reactively rather than proactively.The Justice Kant-led bench directed the chief secretary to set up a citizen advisory board for Noida in four weeks and banned giving effect to any project in Noida without environmental impact assessment and clearance from SC's green bench.In the 20 cases where excess compensation was paid to landowners because of alleged collusion of Noida officials who were identified by SIT, the bench constituted another SIT to conduct a probe into each of these officers and register FIRs on detection of a cognisable offence. It asked the authority to grant sanction for prosecution against delinquent officials within four weeks of SIT seeking it."The SIT headed by a police officer not below the rank of commissioner of police will register preliminary enquiries (PEs) and proceed to inquire into the illustratively highlighted points (in the previous SIT report) and involve experts from forensic account department as well as economic offences wing. If the SIT, after preliminary enquiry, finds commission of cognizable offence, it would register FIRs," the bench said.The court asked this SIT to submit a probe status report but clarified that excess compensation paid to landowners would not be recovered.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousDipika Kakar’s top 10 gorgeous ethnic looks for festive seasontvJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainment Next123 Photostories  Sara Tendulkar’s protein drinks: How to make them and their benefitsWhy is the Peepal tree worshipped in India5 early symptoms of Diabetes in men that should not be ignoredCardiologist says these blood tests that can predict heart disease risks even before symptoms appearTemples, Taj, and Thar: An epic 15-day adventure in the heart of North IndiaThis is how cooking meat may increase the risk of cancerFrom bullied schoolboy to ₹3,000 crore superstar – Hrithik Roshan’s inspiring journeyHow to see incredible India in just two weeksSeeds that supercharge muscle growth and overall healthFrom Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leaves123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillVanessa BryantDwyane WadeKyrie lrvingNHL Trade RumorsShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteHouse panel flags concerns over quality of data for assessing JJM’s performance'Tragic chapter': PM Modi, Amit Shah pay tribute to victims on Partition Horrors Remembrance Day; honour their gritBLA labelled foreign terrorist org as Trump plans to develop Pakistan's 'huge oil reserves'Rajasthan high court order disappointing, but won't lose cool this time: Supreme Court's Pardiwala benchWhen and how to conduct SIR is Election Commission's exclusive domain: Supreme CourtConsider converting Noida to a metropolitan council: Supreme Court to UP govtAll cinemas must screen 1 Bengali film per day: Mamata BanerjeeAdoption law frustrating, needs to be simplified: Supreme CourtDragon-Elephant Tango?

Till now, 12pm to 9pm was considered prime time and so Bengali movies were slotted at 12pm. We've changed the prime-time slot from 3pm to 9pm," minister Aroop Biswas said Wednesday.Earlier, all theatres were required to screen at least 120 Bengali films a year.Information and culture minister Indranil Sen called it a "historic day not only for cinema but for the revival of Bengali asmita and culture".'Screening 1 Bengali film a day will expand language market' Film industry seniors said the decision to screen at least one Bengali film during the 3pm-9pm prime slot could potentially expand the market for Bengali cinema and encourage new producers to invest in language content."This initiative will allow the audience to decide when it is most convenient for them to watch a Bengali film," said actor Prosenjit Chatterjee. Actor-politician Dev said the notification was a "significant win for the Bengali film industry".Multiplex audiences have long complained about the absence of Bengali films in popular late afternoon and evening slots, while directors have expressed frustration that despite positive reviews, their films are often removed from prime slots after only three days.About the AuthorPriyanka DasguptaPriyanka Dasgupta is the features editor of TOI Kolkata.

It said not having children is a social stigma and such parents "want a child badly but the process is cumbersome".The total number of adoptions crossed 4,500 in 2025-26 as of March 31, the highest in 11 years.Average waiting period for adopting kids is 3.5 years However, for many prospective adoptive parents (PAPs), the process of adopting a child continues to be a challenge with an average of 3.5 years waiting period for those seeking infants and young children. The Central Adoption Resource Authority (Cara) dashboard shows there are over 36,616 PAPs across various categories registered to adopt while the number of children available for adoption is merely 2,756."The present adoption process is taking too long. Parents want a child badly but the process is cumbersome and frustrating for them," SC said. It added the existing flaw in the system was reflected in a case that was decided by it a day before, in which four parents from Telangana had adopted children, but not as per the procedure laid down by law, and police thereafter took away custody. The court allowed the plea of the four adoptive parents and restored custody of the children - aged between a few months and three years - to them by invoking its extraordinary power under Article 142 of the Constitution.In this case, the petitioners had adopted the children after they came to know that their biological parents were not willing to keep them. They did not involve the authority concerned in the process and took custody of the children without informing it. But state the police took away the children after it came to know about the adoption, and the children were handed over to the Child Welfare Project Director and Integrated Child Protection Services.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  From Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leavesTop 5 Getaways in North and South India to Work RemotelyFrom Cristiano Ronaldo’s million-dollar sparkler to Arjun Tendulkar’s intimate proposal: Celebrity engagements that created buzz in 2025Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 expensive animal-shaped bags that’ll leave you almost shocked!Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

Why Modi is headed to ChinaDragon-Elephant Tango? Why Modi is headed to ChinaSachin Parashar / TNN /  Aug 14, 2025, 06:52 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLarge  Just a year ago, it would perhaps have taken a big leap of faith for PM Narendra Modi to travel to China. The two countries’ relationship was still on ventilator. The border was relatively quiet, but disengagement of troops at the remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh was still incomplete.Now, as Modi gets ready to visit Tianjin later this month, it seems the most unambivalent thing to do, grounded in a realistic understanding of global uncertainties and the need to reinforce its multialignment.It helps, of course, that the agreement Modi reached with President Xi Jinping on the margins of the Brics summit in Oct — that disputes and differences would not be allowed to disturb border peace — has remained unimpaired. While India’s official announcement is awaited, Modi’s visit is all but certain; so is Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi’s to India next week for talks with NSA Ajit Doval and external affairs minister S Jaishankar.Multilateral, But Still…Granted, Modi’s visit is for a multilateral event: the summit meeting of the SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organisation), a 10-member security-oriented Eurasian grouping dominated by China and Russia, seen as a potential counterweight to Nato. Modi’s last visit to China, in 2018, was also for the SCO summit.Given the state of its ties with China and Pakistan, India is a bit of an outlier in the group, as it doesn’t join others in endorsing initiatives like the BRI (Belt and Road Initiative). In 2023, it also backed out of an economic roadmap as it seemed more aligned with Chinese interests. More recently, India also refused to sign on to a joint statement condemning Israel’s attack on Iran.However, India acknowledges SCO’s role in combating terrorism, particularly in Afghanistan, promoting connectivity that doesn’t undermine sovereignty and territorial integrity, and facilitating its own ties with Central Asia. Modi has used the SCO Heads of State Council meeting, the highest decision-making body of the organisation, to draw attention to cross-border terrorism, without naming Pakistan.SCO has also had an important role to play in bringing India and China together. Russia may not have actively mediated between India and China, but it has nudged both sides to use the forum to engage with each other after 2020’s Galwan clash.The Moscow Consensus, within three months of Galwan — on the margins of the SCO foreign ministers’ meeting in the Russian capital — to ease tensions is a case in point. President Xi Jinping in 2023 also participated in the SCO summit Modi hosted virtually under India’s presidency.However, Modi has also skipped SCO summit meetings. He missed one in Kazakhstan last year. If Modi is travelling to China, it’s because he understands the salience Xi has attached to the Tianjin summit under China’s presidency, prioritising it over Brics this year, and the need to normalise a relationship that he believes is important not just for India and China, but the entire world. Support from China will also be crucial for India’s Brics presidency next year.Peaks & TroughsTrump’s foreign policy has wrongfooted India but, to be fair to the Indian govt, India and China started to rebuild ties long before the US president sent the world careening towards an apocalyptic trade war. In fact, the agreement to end the military standoff in eastern Ladakh happened even before the US presidential elections.By visiting China, Modi is signalling that India is ready to have a sound working relationship with Beijing — as long as border peace and tranquillity is not disturbed. When NSA Doval visited China last Dec, both sides agreed to maintain peace on the ground so that “issues on the border do not hold back the normal development of bilateral relations”.India has not allowed China’s military cooperation with Pakistan — even after Operation Sindoor — to ruin the Sino-Indian thaw, and Beijing was muted in its criticism of India’s first joint patrolling of the South China Sea with the Philippines, suggesting a readiness from both sides to take a long view of the relationship. Modi’s bilateral meeting with Xi, which might see important announcements (such as the resumption of direct flights), is an opportunity for both sides to rebuild trust for a mutually beneficial partnership in areas like trade, investment and emerging technologies, in which China is a global leader.India will expect China to reciprocate by addressing some of its trade restrictions related to manpower and equipment that impact Indian manufacturing, and deliver on the promise to import more to reduce the $100 billion trade deficit. India will also be mindful of China’s efforts to undercut its influence in the neighbourhood and the larger Indo-Pacific. China will expect, as ambassador Xu Feihong told TOI recently, a transparent and non-discriminatory business environment for its companies.The dragon-elephant tango may have just started but, in these circumstances, it will remain accident-prone. The way the relationship has peaked and troughed from the initial Modi years to the Doklam crisis, and again from the excitement over the informal summits to the Galwan despair, serves as an important lesson. The answer probably lies in Modi’s recent remark, quickly endorsed by Beijing, that competition should not be allowed to turn into conflict.So, Is It Bye-Bye America?Not really. Modi has, in the past, attended several SCO summits where he has met Xi — and all it has signified is India’s strategic autonomy. His upcoming visit to China is drawing more attention because of the state of India’s ties with the US.India and the US seemed set to embark on a new phase in the relationship, based on robust and next-generation defence and technology collaborations, along with stronger energy ties, when Trump dropped his tariff bomb, doubling the levy on India for its oil imports from Russia.But it will probably take more than one individual, even if he’s the US president, to do any structural damage to a relationship successive American presidents have called one of the most defining partnerships of the 21st century.Amid calls for India to take on the Trump administration, the govt itself has chosen to avoid confrontation. Trump is known to take maximalist positions ahead of trade agreements, and India is still willing to negotiate. India’s statement that the relationship has weathered such challenges in the past has been received well by the US State Department. The visit to China registers India’s position against Western unilateralism, but India is not giving up on America yet. A possible return of peace in Ukraine can also wipe out half of India’s tariff woes.Three Things To Note For IndiaThere are three things India will guard against, though. The first is whether Trump, chasing a watershed trade deal with China, will remain as committed to the Indo-Pacific as he was during his previous term, when he revived Quad. The tariff issue has cast a shadow on the upcoming Quad summit India has to host in early Nov. If Trump doesn’t come, there will be questions raised about the US’s long-standing policy of dealing with India as a country that can ensure a sustainable balance of power in the region. India’s efforts to restore ties with China help it hedge against this eventuality.Second is the strong counterterrorism cooperation that will likely be diluted by Trump’s remarkable turnaround on Pakistan — from accusing it of hoodwinking US presidents on the issue of terrorism to treating it as a lodestar in the fight against the menace. Re-hyphenating India with Pakistan can potentially cause irreparable damage to relations with India.Third is the impending H-1B overhaul, and the likely impact on Indian professionals in the IT and healthcare sectors. This is sure to ignite another diplomatic firestorm, damaging people-to-people contacts and what India sees as a mutually beneficial economic and technology partnership.All three are issues that will test India’s resolve and push the limits of Indian diplomacy.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  From Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leavesTop 5 Getaways in North and South India to Work RemotelyFrom Cristiano Ronaldo’s million-dollar sparkler to Arjun Tendulkar’s intimate proposal: Celebrity engagements that created buzz in 2025Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 expensive animal-shaped bags that’ll leave you almost shocked!Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

Virk is accused of impersonating law enforcement officers and participating in a Rs 6 crore fraud.  NEW DELHI: ED has arrested Sandeepa Virk, a social media influencer who also ran an online platform with little business, allegedly a front for money laundering.The arrest followed a police case registered in Mohali, with the probe agency conducting raids on Tuesday and Wednesday at multiple locations in Delhi and Mumbai, ED said in a press release.The agency said it found that Virk, who acted in movies and claims to be a cosmetologist, was in regular touch with Angarai Natarajan Sethuraman, a former director of Reliance Capital, which was part of the Anil Ambani group. The ED statement alleged Virk had been communicating with Sethuraman regarding illegal liaising work. It added that this was also confirmed during searches at the residence of Sethuraman, who was a prominent member of the business group's corporate affairs team in Delhi.When contacted, Sethuraman said, "These allegations are entirely baseless" and that he had no connection or involvement with Virk or any transactions related to her.ED alleges diversion of funds by Sethuraman  In a release, ED said, "Besides, diversion of funds for personal benefit has been unearthed during course of search. In 2018, public money of Rs 18 crore approx belonging to Reliance Commercial Finance Ltd was disbursed to Sethuraman by flouting prudent lending norms. The funds were lent under terms that allowed deferment of principal as well as interest, with multiple waivers granted & no due diligence conducted. Besides, home loan of Rs 22 crore was provided by Reliance Capital Limited by violating the prudential norms. Large part of these loans are seen to have been eventually siphoned off and remained unpaid."Sethuraman said that the home loan he received from Reliance Capital was granted following due process and was secured by the property offered as collateral.Following her arrest, Virk was produced before a special court here on Wednesday, which remanded her to ED custody till Aug 14. Virk's arrest came after searches conducted by the agency in Delhi and Mumbai on her premises and those of her close associates,She is accused of impersonating officers of law enforcement agencies, duping individuals, and participating in a Rs 6 crore fraud against complainant Jasneet Kaur, under the pretext of investment in a film project. The main accused in the fraud, Amit Gupta alias Nageshwar Gupta, was declared a proclaimed offender in Oct 2024.The agency claimed during its searches, it seized "incriminating documents" and records, and statements of key persons and associates, including Farrukh Ali, were recorded. ED said its current searches were part of an ongoing investigation into charges against Virk and her associates, who are alleged to have "exerted undue influence through misrepresentation and defrauded individuals by soliciting money under false promises"."Virk has acquired immovable property in her name by making false promises and cheating. She claims to be owner of hyboocare.com, a website purportedly selling FDA-approved beauty products. However, the products listed on the site have been found to be non-existent," the agency said. It added that its probe revealed that the website floated by Virk lacked basics, such as user registration options. Scrutiny of the website uncovered minimal social media engagement, an inactive WhatsApp contact number, and absence of transparent organisational details, all of which reinforce suspicion of non-genuine commercial activity, ED said.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  From Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leavesTop 5 Getaways in North and South India to Work RemotelyFrom Cristiano Ronaldo’s million-dollar sparkler to Arjun Tendulkar’s intimate proposal: Celebrity engagements that created buzz in 2025Kidney damage: From soda to salt, doctor lists everyday American foods that worsen kidney health5 expensive animal-shaped bags that’ll leave you almost shocked!Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

The bill, expected to pass in the upcoming assembly session, increases jail terms and allows arrests without warrants.  DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand cabinet on Wednesday gave its nod to a strict Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Bill, 2025, which provides for a maximum punishment of life imprisonment and fine of up to Rs 10 lakh for "forced conversion". The govt is likely to table the bill in the House, where they have a strong majority, for approval during the three-day monsoon session of assembly commencing on Aug 19.At present, the maximum jail term for such an offence is 10 years and the highest fine is Rs 50,000. The new bill proposes to raise the jail term to 14 years, and, in some cases, to 20 years which may even extend to life imprisonment. Arrests can be made without a warrant and the DM can seize properties acquired through crimes related to conversion. CM Pushkar Singh Dhami told TOI on Wednesday hours after the cabinet decision: "Uttarakhand is Devbhoomi (the land of Gods) and a place where holy saints through the ages came and meditated. In the last few years, there have been instances of demographic changes under the guise of illegal conversions. The proposed amendment is a major step on our part to ensure that the social fabric of the Himalayan state is not changed. Therefore, we have come up with stringent measures to check the illegal practice."Proposal: All offences under new provisions shall be non-bailable  According to the cabinet's proposal, "Whoever receives funds from foreign or (other) entities concerning unlawful religious conversion shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than seven years and which may extend up to 14 years, and shall also be liable to a fine not less than Rs 10 lakh." It further states, "Whoever, with the intent to convert, instils fear for life or property, assaults or uses force, promises marriage or incites or conspires for such conversion, or traffics a minor woman or person or otherwise sells them, or attempts or conspires for this purpose, shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than 20 years and which may extend to life imprisonment, meaning imprisonment for the remainder of that person's natural life, and shall also be liable to a fine."As per the new provisions, concealing religion for marriage is a crime, and offenders could face three to 10 years in prison and a fine of Rs 3 lakh. On "mass conversion", the document says it will attract imprisonment of not less than seven years and up to 14 years, and shall be liable to a fine not less than Rs 1 lakh.Concerning "a minor, woman or a person belonging to a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe, or a disabled or mentally challenged person", the punishment shall be imprisonment not less than five years, which may extend up to 14 years and liable to a fine not less than Rs 1 lakh. For general cases, the jail term would range from three years to 10 years and a fine of Rs 50,000.All offences under the new provisions shall be cognizable and non-bailable and triable by a sessions court. Arrests can be made without a warrant and bail will only be granted if the court is convinced the accused is not guilty and will not repeat the offence. As per the proposal, if any property is acquired through crimes related to conversion, the DM can seize it. The provision mentions: "If the DM has reason to believe that any property in possession of a person, whether movable or immovable, was acquired as a result of an offence under this Act, they may order the seizure of such property, regardless of whether a court has taken cognisance of such offence."Provisions of the Indian Civil Protection Code shall apply to every such seizure, with necessary modifications. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Code, the district magistrate may appoint an administrator for any property seized under subsection (1) and the administrator shall have all powers to manage it in the best interest of such property. The district magistrate may arrange for police assistance for the proper and effective management of such property by the administrator."The amendment has also redefined "inducement", which now means and includes offering any of the following: "Any gift, gratification, easy money, or material benefit in cash or kind. Employment, free education in a school or college run by a religious institution, or a promise to marry or a better lifestyle, divine displeasure or otherwise. Portraying the practices, rituals and ceremonies of one religion in a harmful manner concerning another religion, or glorifying one religion against another."About the AuthorKautilya SinghA Senior Assistant Editor in TOI with an inclination towards political reporting.

The case has been reassigned to a three-judge bench led by Justice Vikram Nath for rehearing.  NEW DELHI: In a significant decision coming two days after Justice J B Pardiwala-led two-judge bench's controversial order for removal of all stray dogs from Delhi and NCR streets, Chief Justice B R Gavai Wednesday withdrew the case from that bench and posted it for rehearing on Thursday before a three-judge special bench led by Justice Vikram Nath.In the much-criticised Aug 11 order, Justices Pardiwala and R Mahadevan had directed Delhi and NCR civic authorities to "start picking up and rounding up stray dogs from all localities of Delhi, Ghaziabad, Noida, Faridabad, Gurgaon as well as areas on the outskirts, and relocate these dogs to designated shelters/pounds."Prompted by pleas from two counsel - one of whom pointed to the order's apparent conflict with a previous judgment of another apex court bench - and the excoriating criticism of SC by animal lovers, activists and the public, CJI Gavai moved speedily to withdraw the matter from Justice Pardiwala's bench and assign it to Justices Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria.Apex court disposed of two dozen pleas last yr On May 9, 2024, a bench of Justices J K Maheshwari and Sanjay Karol had passed an elaborate order disposing of two dozen petitions filed by Kerala, Animal Welfare Board, NGOs and animal lovers appealing against conflicting high court orders on removal of stray dogs.On Wednesday morning, a counsel had mentioned before the CJI that the Aug 11 order was in conflict with last year's SC judgment, which had ordered civic bodies to act with compassion and strictly inaccordance with the Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules, 2023, while dealing with stray dogs.Another counsel appeared before the CJI at 4 pm and complained that while the Aug 11 order was not yet available, authorities had begun implementing it.Also Read: 'Delhi people are fed up of stray dogs': What CM Rekha Gupta said on Supreme Court order; says 'we want to provide relief'In their 2024 judgment, the bench of Justices Maheshwari and Karol had said, "Under all circumstances, there cannot be any indiscriminate killings of canines, and authorities have to take action in terms of the mandate and spirit of the prevalent legislation(s) in place. There is no gainsaying the fact that exhibiting compassion to all living beings is the enshrined constitutional value and mandate and casts obligation on the authorities to maintain it."The Aug 11 order is also not in harmony with the Animal Birth Control rules which prohibit relocation of stray dogs.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Why is the Peepal tree worshipped in India5 early symptoms of Diabetes in men that should not be ignoredCardiologist says these blood tests that can predict heart disease risks even before symptoms appearTemples, Taj, and Thar: An epic 15-day adventure in the heart of North IndiaThis is how cooking meat may increase the risk of cancerFrom bullied schoolboy to ₹3,000 crore superstar – Hrithik Roshan’s inspiring journeyHow to see incredible India in just two weeksSeeds that supercharge muscle growth and overall healthFrom Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leavesTop 5 Getaways in North and South India to Work Remotely123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillVanessa BryantDwyane WadeKyrie lrvingNHL Trade RumorsShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteHouse panel flags concerns over quality of data for assessing JJM’s performance'Tragic chapter': PM Modi, Amit Shah pay tribute to victims on Partition Horrors Remembrance Day; honour their gritBLA labelled foreign terrorist org as Trump plans to develop Pakistan's 'huge oil reserves'Rajasthan high court order disappointing, but won't lose cool this time: Supreme Court's Pardiwala benchWhen and how to conduct SIR is Election Commission's exclusive domain: Supreme CourtConsider converting Noida to a metropolitan council: Supreme Court to UP govtAll cinemas must screen 1 Bengali film per day: Mamata BanerjeeAdoption law frustrating, needs to be simplified: Supreme CourtDragon-Elephant Tango?

The gift builds on decades of Booth’s philanthropy to KU and cements the Gateway project as a civic, athletic, and economic catalyst for Lawrence.David G. Booth net worth: KU alumnus behind historic $300 million gift to University of KansasBooth, a Lawrence High and KU graduate, co-founded Dimensional Fund Advisors in 1981 and is widely credited with bringing financial-science methods to everyday investing. As of June 30, 2025, Dimensional managed $853 billion in assets, underscoring Booth’s stature in global finance.His KU ties are deep: beyond this new gift, Booth has supported the university across athletics and academics for decades including the donation of James Naismith’s original rules of basketball and a foundational football-stadium gift that led to the facility bearing his name. David G. Booth, with an estimated net worth of $5 billion as reported by Celebrity Net Worth, has been a major benefactor of the University of Kansas. In 2004, he donated $9 million to the Booth Family Hall of Athletics. Married to Suzanne Deal with two children, the couple famously purchased James Naismith’s original 13 basketball rules for $4.3 million and donated them to KU, honoring Naismith’s legacy as the university’s basketball founder and nine-season head coach.Booth’s $75 million gift boosts Kansas athletics and Gateway District Phase IIBooth’s commitment does two things:$75 million is designated to jump-start Gateway District Phase II and continue stadium work.The remainder is structured to generate an ongoing income stream that will fund Kansas Athletics “across generations,” providing flexibility in an era of revenue sharing and rapid change in the college landscape as reported by University of KansasKansas AD Travis Goff called the gift “transformative” for accelerating construction and creating new, sustainable revenue. Gateway District Phase II adds 162-room hotel, student housing, and event plazaAs per the local news reports of Kansas, Phase II extends the mixed-use district on the stadium’s east side and is designed to activate the campus edge year-round—not only on game days. Current city-approved plans include:A 162-room hotel connected to the conference center443 beds of student housing~43,000 sq. ft. of retail/restaurant/office~1,000 parking spacesAn outdoor event plazaThese elements were green-lit alongside a package of local incentives that capped public bonds and set accountability provisions.Ku Gateway District Phase I and II: $450M stadium upgrades and east-side expansionPhase I (southwest, west, and north sides; major football complex upgrades) represents about $450 million in investment and will be complete for the Aug. 23 home opener vs Fresno State.Phase II focuses on the east side of the stadium and the surrounding district components outlined above. While KU has not released a final construction timetable, Booth’s gift allows work to move forward after the 2025 season. On August 12, 2025, the Lawrence City Commission approved a package of financial tools—TIF and STAR bond districts among them—worth about $94.6 million to support Phase II (roughly 27% of that phase’s costs). The development agreement includes:A cap on public bonding and evidence-of-completion requirementsA KU commitment to create an off-campus housing office (within 18 months)City access to up to $14.5 million in new district tax revenues for local corridor and stormwater improvementsKU Gateway District to boost tourism, downtown growth, and community relationsCommissioners and stakeholders cited the district’s potential to drive tourism, support downtown, and enhance Lawrence’s town-gown relationship.Beyond bricks and mortar, Booth’s design—front-loading construction while endowing a recurring revenue stream—positions KU to remain strategic and innovative amid new financial realities (e.g., revenue sharing, NIL, conference realignment). The approach gives Kansas the capacity to invest in programs sustainably, rather than relying solely on annual fundraising cycles. Booth’s Long KU legacy: From Naismith’s rules to a reimagined stadiumBooth’s philanthropy spans decades:2004–2011: Support for the Booth Family Hall of Athletics and donation of Naismith’s original rules, now displayed at the DeBruce Center.2017–2018: A $50 million foundational stadium gift and, subsequently, the naming of David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium.2025: The new ~$300 million commitment to propel Gateway Phase II and secure long-term athletics funding.Also Read | This African country has no mobile internet access; here’s the surprising truth behind its digital blackoutAbout the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

One night, thousands dead: Lake Nyos tragedy that killed 1,700 people overnight in Cameroon
In 1986, Lake Nyos in Cameroon experienced a devastating limnic eruption, releasing a massive carbon dioxide cloud that killed approximately 1,700 people and 3,500 animals. This rare phenomenon, caused by the sudden release of accumulated CO2, prompted scientific investigation and the implementation of degassing systems to prevent future disasters.

This rare phenomenon, caused by the sudden release of accumulated CO2, prompted scientific investigation and the implementation of degassing systems to prevent future disasters.  On 21 August 1986, Lake Nyos in northwestern Cameroon became the site of one of the deadliest natural disasters in modern history. A sudden limnic eruption released a massive cloud of carbon dioxide (CO2), a gas denser than air, which swept down the surrounding valleys, suffocating people and livestock in nearby villages. Within hours, approximately 1,700 people and 3,500 animals were killed. This catastrophic event shocked the world, as scientists struggled to understand how a seemingly peaceful volcanic lake could unleash such a lethal, invisible force in mere minutes. Even today, Lake Nyos remains a key case study for natural hazard scientists worldwide.What caused the Lake Nyos disaster? Understanding the mechanics behind the deadly limnic eruptionThe Lake Nyos disaster was caused by a rare natural phenomenon known as a limnic eruption. Limnic eruptions occur when deep lake water becomes saturated with gases, particularly carbon dioxide, which is released suddenly when the water overturns. In the case of Lake Nyos, CO2 had accumulated over decades in the deep layers of the lake, trapped under high pressure. Scientists believe several potential triggers may have initiated the catastrophic outgassing: a minor landslide into the lake, small volcanic activity beneath the lakebed, or unusually heavy rainfall that disturbed the stratified water layers. When the dense CO2-saturated water rose rapidly to the surface, the gas came out of solution explosively, forming a heavy cloud that flowed down surrounding valleys, displacing oxygen and suffocating anything in its path.This rare and unpredictable phenomenon highlights the hidden dangers of certain volcanic lakes, which may appear harmless on the surface but harbor lethal forces beneath.The deadly impact on people and livestock: Eyewitness accounts and the scale of devastationThe CO2 cloud generated by Lake Nyos traveled at speeds of 20–50 kilometres per hour, hugging the ground due to its higher density compared with air. It flowed into nearby villages within a 25-kilometre radius, including Nyos, Kam, Cha, and Subum, instantly killing people and animals. Eyewitnesses described waking to an overwhelming smell of sulfur or rotten eggs, collapsing unconscious, and finding family members lifeless around them. In total, around 1,700 people and 3,500 livestock died within hours, while approximately 4,000 survivors were forced to flee their homes. Many of these survivors suffered from respiratory issues, paralysis, and pressure-induced lesions caused by the suffocating gas.The psychological trauma was also profound, as communities watched family, friends, and neighbors die silently in the night. The disaster devastated local livelihoods, as the loss of livestock and crops left entire villages struggling to recover.Immediate scientific response and long-term degassing efforts: Preventing future disastersThe scale and suddenness of the Lake Nyos disaster prompted urgent scientific study to understand and mitigate future risks. Researchers discovered that CO2 could build up in other deep, stratified volcanic lakes, and preventive measures were urgently needed. In 2001, a permanent degassing system was installed in Lake Nyos.The system involves a pipe inserted into the lake’s deep waters to slowly release CO2 in a controlled manner. Initially, pumps were used to start the process, but as the gas began to escape, it created a self-sustaining flow that continues without external power. Two additional pipes were installed in 2011 to increase safety, and by 2019 scientists confirmed that even a single pipe could maintain safe CO2 levels indefinitely.These measures have drastically reduced the risk of another sudden eruption, ensuring the lake is monitored continuously and that surrounding communities are better protected.Lessons and global significance: How Lake Nyos changed our understanding of natural hazardsLake Nyos is one of only two recorded limnic eruptions in history, the other being Lake Monoun in Cameroon in 1984. These events have shown that certain volcanic lakes, particularly in the East African Rift region, can store large amounts of CO2 over decades, creating a hidden threat that can be triggered suddenly. The Lake Nyos tragedy sparked global scientific interest in understanding such lakes and implementing early-warning systems. Research extended to other African lakes, including Lake Kivu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is far larger and similarly gas-saturated. Although subsequent studies have revised risk levels for Lake Kivu, the Nyos disaster remains a key example of the lethal potential of limnic eruptions. Beyond science, the tragedy highlights the importance of disaster preparedness, community awareness, and international support for vulnerable populations living near high-risk natural sites.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The Ministry of Education has optimized weekly class schedules across grade levels and launched a nationwide AI curriculum. This initiative aims to modernize learning, enhance student well-being, and cultivate digital skills in line with Vision 2030. Ministry of Education has confirmed the start dates for the upcoming 2025–2026 academic year/Representative Image Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Education has confirmed the start dates for the upcoming 2025–2026 academic year, along with new weekly class schedules across all grade levels and the introduction of a nationwide Artificial Intelligence (AI) curriculum. These changes reflect a careful balance between improving academic delivery, supporting student well-being, and preparing future generations for a technology-driven world in line with Vision 2030.TL;DR:Most Saudi regions will begin school on August 24, 2025; schools in Makkah, Madinah, Jeddah, and Taif will start officially on August 31.The Ministry has released grade-wise weekly class/subject structures to optimize learning while supporting student wellbeing.All grades will experience hands-on, progressive AI modules, starting 2025–2026, to build national digital and analytical skills.Academic year start dates & staggered returnIn most regions, administrative staff and education supervisors resumed work on August 12, 2025, while teachers returned on August 17, with student classes starting on August 24. In high-density education hubs such as Makkah, Madinah, Jeddah, and Taif, the schedule is offset by one week: staff report on August 17, teachers on August 24, and students begin on August 31. This staggered approach aims to allow better coordination, facility readiness, and smoother student transitions in the busiest school zones.Weekly class structure by gradeThe Ministry’s updated timetable allocates 33 weekly periods (each period roughly 45 minutes) for Grades 1 to 6, with younger students covering eight subjects plus activity classes, and older elementary pupils covering ten subjects. Intermediate school students in Grades 7 and 8 have 35 periods with ten subjects, while Grade 9 students also have 35 periods but with an additional non-academic development component. Secondary school students under the General Track System have 32 periods per week, with subjects varying by semester and grade to accommodate advanced specialization while maintaining core learning standards. This shift is designed to sustain rigorous academics while creating room for sports, arts, and other student development programs.AI curriculum rollout: Building future skillsFor the first time in Saudi Arabia’s public education system, students in all grades will be taught artificial intelligence through age-appropriate, practical lessons. Developed in partnership between the National Curriculum Center, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, and the Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA), this program introduces AI concepts step-by-step, linking them to real-life applications. Hands-on projects encourage problem-solving, critical thinking, and creativity, while preparing students to participate in emerging technology sectors. The new curriculum builds on the success of previous high school AI pilots and directly supports Vision 2030’s Human Capability Development Program, aiming to position the Kingdom as a regional leader in digital talent.The 2025–2026 academic year marks a significant milestone for Saudi Arabia’s education system. With region-specific school start dates, an optimized class schedule, and the groundbreaking introduction of AI education from primary to secondary levels, these reforms are designed to modernize learning, promote student well-being, and equip young Saudis with the knowledge and skills to thrive in a rapidly changing, tech-driven global economy.FAQ1. When will the 2025–2026 school year start in Saudi Arabia?Most regions start on August 24, 2025, while Makkah, Madinah, Jeddah, and Taif begin on August 31, 2025.2. Why do some cities have later start dates?The staggered schedule eases logistical challenges and prepares facilities in high-density areas.3. What changes have been made to the weekly class schedule?Weekly periods are set at 33 for elementary, 35 for intermediate, and 32 for secondary students, with subjects adjusted by grade.4. What’s new about the curriculum this year?All grades will have age-appropriate AI lessons developed with SDAIA and other partners.5. How does this change support Vision 2030?By teaching AI and digital skills from early grades, it builds a future-ready workforce and strengthens Saudi Arabia’s tech leadership.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Coastal regions face sudden land subsidence and massive waves, posing unprecedented risks to millions. Researchers urge immediate action for improved early-warning systems and resilient infrastructure to minimize potential devastation. Representative image Scientists are warning of a potentially catastrophic mega-tsunami that could strike parts of the US Pacific Coast, triggered by a major earthquake along the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ). Stretching roughly 600 miles from Northern California to Vancouver Island, this fault line accumulates massive tectonic stress as the Juan de Fuca Plate slides beneath the North American Plate. Researchers from Virginia Tech, led by geoscientist Tina Dura, estimate there is a 15% chance of a magnitude 8.0 or greater earthquake occurring along the CSZ within the next 50 years.According to their study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, such an event could suddenly sink coastal land by up to 6.5 feet, dramatically expanding floodplains and generating tsunami waves hundreds of feet high, posing unprecedented risks to millions of residents, critical infrastructure, and ecosystems along the West Coast.US Tsunami: Waves Top 3 Feet, Northern California Still On Alert; Tourists ‘Flee’ Hawaii | WatchTsunami threat along the Cascadia Subduction ZoneThe Cascadia Subduction Zone is one of North America’s most hazardous fault lines, according to the Virginia Tech research team. Over centuries, tectonic stress builds as the oceanic Juan de Fuca Plate is forced beneath the North American Plate. When this stress is released during a major earthquake, coastal regions could experience sudden land subsidence, dramatically increasing floodplain areas and altering shorelines almost instantly. The last great earthquake along this fault occurred in 1700, triggering a tsunami recorded as far away as Japan. The Virginia Tech study emphasizes that a similar event today would have far more devastating effects due to dense populations, developed urban infrastructure, and critical transportation networks along the coast. Researchers warn that rapid inundation could leave little time for evacuation, magnifying the human and economic toll.The potential mega-tsunami threatAccording to simulations conducted by Dura and her team, a major CSZ earthquake could generate a “mega-tsunami” with waves potentially reaching up to 1,000 feet, far surpassing typical tsunami heights of only a few feet. Coastal cities including Seattle, Portland, and towns in northern California could be submerged within minutes. The Virginia Tech study ran tens of thousands of models, showing that thousands more people, buildings, and miles of roads would be exposed to flooding than current hazard maps predict. Researchers emphasize that such an event would combine sudden ground subsidence with extreme wave heights, creating conditions unlike any historical tsunami in the region. The study highlights the urgent need for improved early-warning systems, evacuation planning, and resilient infrastructure to minimize potential loss of life.Areas at highest risk of tsunamiThe Virginia Tech research identifies southern Washington, northern Oregon, and northern California as the regions most vulnerable to flooding from a CSZ mega-tsunami. While Alaska and Hawaii also face tsunami risks due to their own seismic activity, they are geographically farther from the CSZ and would experience less immediate threat. Low-lying coastal zones along the fault line could face permanent inundation, particularly when combined with climate-driven sea level rise projected by 2100. The study underscores that communities must prioritize flood-resilient urban planning, fortification of critical infrastructure, and preparation for long-term displacement scenarios. Emergency planners are advised to use the study’s simulations to guide evacuation routes, reinforce hospitals and shelters, and prepare for cascading impacts to energy, water, and transportation systems.Urgency of preparedness for tsunami and earthquakeLead researcher Tina Dura emphasizes that a mega-tsunami triggered by a CSZ earthquake would be sudden and catastrophic, not a gradual environmental change. The study warns that without proactive disaster planning, evacuation protocols, and resilient construction, a major quake could result in more than 30,000 deaths, damage over 170,000 structures, and incur economic losses exceeding $81 billion. Researchers highlight that combining earthquake and tsunami hazards with projected climate-driven sea level rise makes this a “compound disaster” scenario that demands immediate attention. According to Dura, local governments, policymakers, and coastal residents must act swiftly to implement early-warning systems, strengthen building codes, and conduct community-wide preparedness drills. The Virginia Tech study serves as a critical wake-up call, emphasizing that preparation today could dramatically reduce the human and economic costs of a future mega-tsunami.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Daley reportedly left voicemails celebrating Thompson's death and threatening his family, expressing anger over corporate greed. He was arrested, released under GPS monitoring, and could face a five-year prison sentence if convicted. . A New York man has been charged with cyberstalking a family member of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, accused of leaving threatening voicemails, just hours after Thompson was fatally shot on a Manhattan sidewalk in December. The suspect, Shane Daley, 40, was arrested on Wednesday for reportedly making multiple phone calls to Thompson’s family member in the days following the shooting, leaving messages claiming the killing was justified and Thompson’s family member and children also deserve to die in the same way, reported CBS News.According to a criminal complaint filed in Albany federal court, the suspect left profanity-laced voicemails calling Thompson a “f****** capitalist pig” and claiming he was killed for “profiting off the backs of poor Americans,” as per CNBC.Daley, from Galway, New York, a small town north of Albany, was arrested on account of cyberstalking, made his initial court appearance on Wednesday. He was released under GPS monitoring and is due back in court Thursday afternoon, according to a spokesperson for the US attorney’s office in Albany.Daley’s attorney, Samuel Breslin, said that the allegations are under review.If found guilty, he can face a maximum sentence of five years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000, and up to three years of supervised release."Brian Thompson was gunned down in midtown Manhattan. Daley, as alleged, gleefully welcomed this tragedy and did all that he could to increase the Thompson family's pain and suffering,” stated acting US attorney John A. Sarcone, as cited by CBS News.Daley’s calls were “more than callous and cold-hearted,” said Christopher Raia, the FBI’s New York assistant director in charge. “They were threatening and terrified a family already suffering following the violent death of their loved one,” Raia said, reported CNBC. Thompson, 50, was fatally shot outside the New York Hilton Midtown hotel on December 4, in what the police described as a targeted attack. The suspect, Luigi Mangione, was taken into custody in Pennsylvania after an extensive nationwide manhunt. Prosecutors said he was motivated by anger over perceived corporate greed. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to both state and federal charges.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Federal officers and National Guard troops have been deployed across key areas, leading to increased patrols and arrests. Department of Homeland Security Investigations agents join Washington Metropolitan Police Department officers as they conduct traffic checks at a checkpoint along 14th Street in northwest Washington (AP photo) Residents in parts of Washington DC took to the streets Wednesday to protest President Donald Trump’s takeover of the city’s police department and the surge of federal officers and National Guard troops. The demonstrations, marked by chants and calls for drivers to avoid police checkpoints, came as the White House defended the month-long federal control as necessary to combat crime, despite city data showing violent crime at a decades-low, reported AP.Residents rally against 24/7 presence of federal agentsLaw enforcement set up a vehicle checkpoint along the busy 14th Street Northwest corridor, prompting hecklers to shout, “Go home, fascists” and “Get off our streets.” Some protesters stood before the checkpoint urging drivers to turn away.The protests followed Trump’s unprecedented announcement that his administration would take over the Metropolitan Police Department for at least a month. The city’s Democratic mayor described the move as an “authoritarian push” before later calling it a public safety measure with no clear benchmarks for success. Trump has argued that crime in the city is at “emergency levels,” while local leaders point to statistics showing violent crime at a 30-year low after a sharp rise two years ago.Troops and federal agents patrol key areasFederal officers and National Guard troops were deployed to more high-profile areas Wednesday, with plans for expanded missions on Thursday (local time), according to a National Guard spokesman. Homeland Security Investigations agents patrolled the U Street corridor, Drug Enforcement Administration officers were seen on the National Mall, and FBI agents were stationed along Massachusetts Avenue. DEA agents also joined city police in the Navy Yard neighborhood, while National Guard members were parked nearby.1,450 federal and local officers, on Tuesday night, patrolled the city, making 43 arrests, compared with about two dozen the night before. Councilmember Christina Henderson dismissed the arrest count as “a bunch of traffic stops” and said the administration was trying to disguise how unnecessary the intervention was. “I'm looking at this list of arrests and they sound like a normal Saturday night in any big city,” she said.Trump defends move, signals possible extensionFederal law allows the president to control Washington’s police for up to 30 days without congressional approval. Trump suggested he could seek more time or ask Congress for authority to alter city laws. “We’re gonna do this very quickly. But we’re gonna want extensions. I don’t want to call a national emergency. If I have to, I will,” he said.Later, on Truth Social, he wrote, “DC has been under siege from thugs and killers, but now, DC is back under Federal Control where it belongs.”White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said, “President Trump is delivering on his campaign promise to clean up this city and restore American Greatness to our cherished capital.”The plan also includes clearing homeless encampments. US Park Police have removed dozens of tents since March and plan to dismantle more this week. People are offered shelter and addiction treatment, but those who refuse could be fined or jailed, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.City leaders seek clarity amid crime dropPolice Chief Pamela Smith said the Metropolitan Police Department is down nearly 800 officers and that federal reinforcements would help fill the gap. Mayor Muriel Bowser said officials were not given specific goals for the surge during a meeting with Attorney General Pam Bondi and other federal officials but shared the aim of increasing presence and removing guns from the streets. She previously called Trump’s move “unsettling and unprecedented,” while noting it was within his legal rights regarding the district.Some residents say the increased force is unnerving. “I’ve seen them right here at the subway ... they had my street where I live at blocked off yesterday, actually,” Washington native Sheina Taylor said, quoted by AP. “It’s more fearful now because even though you’re a law-abiding citizen, here in D.C., you don’t know, especially because I’m African American.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Did Taliban divert international aid? US watchdog blames Afghanistan rulers of using force; blocking assistance to minorities
A US watchdog report reveals the Taliban's alleged diversion of international aid in Afghanistan, using coercion and potentially collaborating with UN officials for kickbacks. The report suggests aid is being channeled to favored communities, with allegations of extortion and control over humanitarian operations. These findings raise serious concerns about the transparency and effectiveness of aid distribution in the country.

The report suggests aid is being channeled to favored communities, with allegations of extortion and control over humanitarian operations. These findings raise serious concerns about the transparency and effectiveness of aid distribution in the country. ANI file photo  Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities are reportedly diverting international aid through coercion and other methods, denying assistance to minority communities, and may be working with UN officials to solicit kickbacks, a US watchdog reported on Tuesday. The findings, from the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), are based on accounts from nearly 90 current and former US and UN officials, as well as other sources.India Abstains UN Vote on Afghanistan, Slams ‘Business as Usual’ Approach to Terrorism, Taliban"In Afghanistan, SIGAR found that the Taliban use every means at their disposal, including force, to ensure that aid goes where they want it to go, as opposed to where donors intend," the report said, as per Reuters. SIGAR reported that an Afghan aid worker who contributed to the report was killed after revealing that food aid was diverted to a Taliban military training camp, but it could not confirm who was behind the killing, as per Reuters. Taliban spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat rejected the allegations, saying that government agencies work together to “ensure transparency” and prevent any diversion, noting that aid in Afghanistan is distributed independently.The report claimed that the Taliban makes use of force and other regulatory measures to exert control over aid flow in the country. They also reportedly decide which humanitarian groups are allowed to operate, channeling US-funded assistance to the favored majority Pashtun communities over minority groups, and extorting humanitarian workers.Interviewees alleged that UN officials solicited bribes from companies and aid groups in exchange for contracts, and that Taliban officials allegedly "collude with UN officials to extort bribes from UN contractors and then split the proceeds," said the report, as per Reuters. Between August 2021, when the Taliban seized power, and April 2025, when the Trump administration cut most US assistance, international donors contributed $10.72 billion in aid to Afghanistan, including $3.83 billion from the United States, the report said.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Wildfire in Greece (AP photo) Wildfires intensified across southern Europe on Wednesday, killing at least three people and forcing thousands to evacuate homes in Greece, Spain, Turkey and Albania. In Greece, firefighters worked through the night to protect the port city of Patras, the country’s third-largest city. Flames swept through pine forests and olive groves, burning houses, agricultural sites and dozens of vehicles. The fire service said the risk of more fires remained “very high” in several regions. At least 15 firefighters were injured or treated for burns, smoke inhalation and exhaustion. Residents joined the firefighting effort, using buckets of water and tree branches to beat down flames. Aircraft dropped water over the affected areas. Weeks of heatwaves have stretched firefighting resources across Greece and its neighbours. On the Greek island of Chios, exhausted firefighters were seen sleeping on the roadside after overnight shifts. In Albania, an 80-year-old man died in a fire south of Tirana. Villages in central Albania were evacuated, and explosions were reported in the Korca district due to buried World War II-era shells. Dozens of homes were destroyed.Wildfires rage across southern Europe | BBC News In Spain, a firefighting volunteer died in the Castile and Leon region, where thousands have been displaced. Some evacuees spent the night outdoors. Fires disrupted high-speed rail services between Madrid and Galicia. In Turkey, a forestry worker was killed and four others were injured when a fire truck crashed while responding to a blaze. Turkey has been battling wildfires since late June, with 18 deaths reported so far. France which is recovering from massive recent fires in the southern regions, faced another day of extreme heat, with temperatures reaching 42°C. Authorities restricted public events in high-risk areas. Officials across the region cited lightning storms, farming activities, faulty power lines and arson as possible causes. The European Union has sent ground teams and aircraft to help, including in Montenegro, where large fires continue to burn near the capital, Podgorica.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Canada wildfires (AP photo) Almost 20,000 people in western Canada were on standby on Wednesday as a wildfire swept across Mount Underwood, overlooking the city of Port Alberni. Authorities say the blaze is “out of control” and could spread further. Wildfires are also threatening other parts of the country. In Newfoundland and Labrador, parts of the capital St. John’s were ordered to evacuate on Tuesday after fires intensified. In Nova Scotia, a blaze was burning on the outskirts of Halifax, home to nearly half a million people.Heatwave fuels wildfire crisis across seven provinces | CTV National News at 11 for August 12, 2025As of Wednesday, more than 700 wildfires were burning across Canada, including 161 out of control. Smoke has triggered air quality alerts for tens of millions in Canada and the US, and has travelled across the Atlantic, reaching parts of western Europe. This year is already Canada’s second-worst wildfire season since records began in 1983, with 7.4 million hectares burned, an area nearly as large as Panama. The worst was in 2023, when 17.3 million hectares were destroyed. Experts say climate change is increasing the risk of fires, with higher temperatures, reduced snow, shorter winters, and earlier summers. Fires along the coast, once rare, are now being reported more often.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

He announced federal control over the Metropolitan Police Department, deploying the National Guard to restore order. Trump vowed to liberate the city from thugs and killers, aiming to make it safe, clean, habitable, and beautiful once more. Donald Trump (AP file photo) US president Donald Trump on Wednesday said that Washington’s crime rate was among the highest in the world. He claimed DC’s homicide rate was worse than in cities like Mexico City, Bogota, Islamabad and Addis Ababa, and almost ten times higher than Fallujah in Iraq. Posting on Truth Social, the US president wrote, “If DC were a state, it would have the highest homicide rate of any state in America. The violent crime rate in DC has worsened, and the murder rate has essentially doubled in just over a decade. He also alleged manipulation of crime data. "But these are only the ‘official’ statistics released by corrupt city officials. The real numbers are many times worse. In fact, a precinct commander was just suspended for allegedly manipulating the violent crime statistics, and the DC police union likewise says the real numbers are much higher,” Trump wrote.. He further alleged that the Democrat government of DC had “largely stopped investigating, arresting and prosecuting most crime,” adding that no one was arrested for shoplifting. Trump said DC residents were living in fear and had largely given up on calling the police, instead avoiding the streets after dark. He added, “DC has been under siege from thugs and killers, but now DC is back under federal control where it belongs. The White House is in charge. The military and our great police will liberate this city, scrape away the filth, and make it safe, clean, habitable and beautiful once more!” Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Trump announced that the Metropolitan Police Department would now be under federal authority, with the National Guard deployed to restore order. He said the aim was to make the capital “safe, clean, habitable and beautiful” again.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

One person sustained life-threatening injuries, and two others were critically injured. The bus veered off the road for unknown reasons, prompting an investigation by the Texas Department of Public Safety. AP file photo  A school bus with over 40 children and one adult aboard overturned in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday, the first day of the new school year, injuring 12, as per officials, reported ABC News.The bus was transporting students from Leander Independent School District in northwest Austin, located in Travis County. Out of the 12 people taken to a local hospital from the scene, one person suffered life-threatening injuries and two others were critically injured, Austin-Travis County authorities reported at a Wednesday evening press conference.The rest, who suffered non-life-threatening injuries, were brought to a reunification center for evaluation and to be reunited with their families.The rollover happened after school but before any students were dropped off, as per Bruce Gearing, the superintendent of the Leander Independent School District, reported NBC News.The driver was an experienced veteran and noted that the bus mainly serves students from a local elementary school, Gearing said. He added that it remains unclear how many students were wearing seatbelts at the time of the rollover.“This part of our Leander ISD family has been through so much already this summer with the floods and this tragedy this afternoon is really breaking our hearts,” said Gearing, reported NBC News. “We want each of those students and their families to know that our prayers are with them, our thoughts are with them, and we will do everything that we can in our power to support them,” he added. It is still unclear why the 2024 model bus equipped with seatbelts veered off the right side of the road before overturning, as per an official from the Texas Department of Public Safety. The official pointed out a slight curve in the roadway and said a preliminary investigation is underway.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Trump demands Biden retract his statements, issue an apology, and remove the content. Her attorney asserts Biden's claims are false, disparaging, and widely circulated, threatening legal action if he doesn't comply. Melania Trump, Hunter Biden (AP) US First Lady Melania Trump has issued a $1 billion legal notice to Hunter Biden, alleging that he made "false, defamatory, disparaging, and inflammatory statements" about her regarding her connections with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. She is demanding that he remove the content, retract his statements, and issue a formal apology, warning of potential legal action if he fails to comply, reported Fox News.Alejandro Brito, the attorney serving as litigation counsel for the first lady, called on Biden to "immediately retract the false, defamatory, disparaging and inflammatory statements made about Mrs. Trump," referring to remarks made in a video interview with Channel 5’s Andrew Callaghan that was posted on YouTube early August.In the video interview titled “Hunter Biden Returns,” Biden, the former first son, claims, "Epstein introduced Melania to Trump. The connections are, like, so wide and deep.""Jeffrey Epstein introduced Melania, and that’s how Melania and the first lady and the President met,” Biden said.Brito described the statements as highly obscene and widely circulated across platforms, noting that the video has been republished by numerous media outlets, journalists, and political commentators with massive followings."These false, disparaging, defamatory, and inflammatory statements are extremely salacious and have been widely disseminated throughout various digital mediums," wrote Brito in a letter addressed to Biden and his attorney Abbe Lowell, as reported by Fox News. "Indeed, the video has since been re-published by various media outlets, journalists, and political commentators with millions of social media followers that have disseminated the false and defamatory statements therein to tens of millions of people worldwide."Brito asserted that Biden’s “source” for the false claims was “serial fabulist Michael Wolff,” whose allegations appeared in a Daily Beast article titled “Melania Trump ‘Very Involved’ in Epstein Scandal: Author.”"Given your vast history of trading on the names of others, including your surname, for your personal benefit, it is obvious that you published these false and defamatory statements about Mrs. Trump to draw attention to yourself," Brito added. Brito urged Biden to issue a prominent retraction of the video and all other false or damaging statements about Trump noting that if he does not comply with the demands, “Mrs. Trump will be left with no alternative but to enforce her legal and equitable rights, all of which are expressly reserved and are not waived, including by filing legal action for over $1 Billion Dollars in damages." "You are on notice,” Brito added. Biden failed to meet the deadline to comply with the requests, as per a source familiar with the situation, reported Fox News.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Fears of a second Yalta summit loom as President Trump prepares to meet President Putin, raising concerns among Ukrainians and Europeans about potential land swaps and the redrawing of borders without their representation.

The original Yalta conference, where superpowers divided Europe, serves as a stark reminder of nations' fates being decided by others. 123 The world's superpowers met in 1945 in the Black Sea port of Yalta to divide up Europe after the defeat of Nazi Germany. They drew lines on the map that tore apart countries, effectively delivered Eastern Europe to Soviet occupation and dismembered Poland. And none of those countries were represented. As President Trump prepares to meet President Putin on Friday in Alaska, there is more talk - and anxiety - among Ukrainians and Europeans about a second Yalta. They are not scheduled to be present, and Trump has said he plans to negotiate "land swaps" with Putin over Ukrainian territory. "Yalta is a symbol of everything we fear," said Peter Schneider, who wrote "The Wall Jumper," about the division of Berlin. At Yalta, the world was divided and "countries were handed to Stalin," he said.Yalta, itself in Russian-annexed Crimea, is a symbol for how superpowers can decide the fates of other nations. "It's a linchpin moment, when the European world is divided in two and the fate of Europeans in the East is locked in without any possible say," said Ivan Vejvoda, a Serb political scientist with the Institute for Human Sciences, a research institution in Vienna. "Today's world is different, but decisions are being made on behalf of third countries for whom this is an existential issue," Vejvoda said.Putin's stated aims do not end with Ukraine. As a revisionist, he wants a new "security architecture" in Europe that recognizes the old Soviet sphere of influence.The Yalta meeting of the UK, the Soviet Union and the US, took place in Feb 1945, after France and Belgium had been liberated and the defeat of Germany was inevitable. The summit was followed by a conference in Germany which reconfirmed the division of Europe into Western and Soviet spheres.Franklin D Roosevelt and Winston Churchill were both ailing. Many believed that the two men had been taken in by the promises of Joseph Stalin that he would allow free elections in the countries occupied by the Red Army. "Yalta has gone down in history as many things, but it became a dirty word in Eastern Europe," since a main topic of the conference was its new borders, said Serhii Plokhii, a professor of Ukrainian history at Harvard.Charles de Gaulle, who led the Free French Forces during the World War II, was also not invited to Yalta, Plokhii noted. "Here we see clear parallels between de Gaulle and Europe and Poland and Ukraine," he said. Of course, there are clear differences, Plokhii said. Stalin was troublesome but an ally, who had been instrumental in defeating the Nazis. Roosevelt and Churchill were doing what they could "to better the situation for the territories already occupied by the Red Army." They were not giving up territories the allies held, as Stalin wanted, he said.Today, Plokhii said, Putin wants Ukraine to hand over territories not occupied by Russia. So that also raises another controversial moment in history, at Munich in 1938, when Neville Chamberlain agreed with Adolf Hitler to dismantle Czechoslovakia, which was not represented at those talks, in a doomed effort to keep peace.Putin's demand for unconquered Ukrainian territory is similar to Hitler's demand for the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia in 1938, Timothy Snyder, a historian of the Cold War, said. "If Ukraine is forced to concede the rest of the Donbas, it would concede defensive lines, which is what Czechs had to do," he said. "Hitler's aim was to destroy Czechoslovakia," Snyder said, "and Putin's goal is to destroy Ukraine."

Despite stepping back from politics, Trump wants his daughter, Ivanka, to be involved in the planning and organization of the event. Ivanka's potential participation would mark her return to public events after a three-year break. Ivanka Trump with her father, Donald Trump (Instagram: ivankatrump)  President Donald Trump reportedly wants his daughter, Ivanka Trump, to participate in planning and organizing an Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) cage fight on the White House lawn to commemorate America’s 250th Independence anniversary next year. This comes despite her having stepped back from politics.Since Trump’s reelection for a second term last November, Ivanka has largely stayed out of the public spotlight. However, UFC CEO Dana White said the president wants her involved in the plans for the White House event.“When [Trump] called me and asked me to do it, he said, ‘I want Ivanka in the middle of this,’” White told CBS Mornings. “So Ivanka reached out to me, and her and I started talking about the possibilities, where it would be and, you know, I put together all the renderings.”Ivanka has attended multiple UFC events with her father, as reported by the Independent.White’s relationship with Trump dates back to the early 2000s, when the president hosted some of the first UFC events at his properties. White confirmed that discussions with Trump took place Monday night, and the fight is scheduled for July 4, 2026.Trump, who has attended several UFC events, said the occasion would be one of many celebrations marking the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.Ivanka’s potential involvement would mark her return to public events after a three-year break, during which she has focused on her children and husband, Jared Kushner. In 2022, she stated, “I love my father very much. This time around, I am choosing to prioritize my young children and the private life we are creating as a family. I do not plan to be involved in politics.”Both Ivanka and Kushner played central roles in Trump’s 2016 campaign and served as presidential advisors beginning in 2017. Following the contentious 2020 election and the Capitol Hill riots, Ivanka chose not to participate in her father’s second presidential run.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Gardaí confirmed they are investigating the assault and his injuries are “non-life threatening”.An Indian-origin woman has put a post on Reddit saying her 60-year-old father was harassed by boys, aged around seven and eight, who tried to take his wallet at a bus stop in Dublin on Aug 9.These are just the latest in a string of racist attacks targeting Indians in Ireland which have left the Indian community terrified to step outside.India Day in Ireland, which celebrates the country’s cultural ties, has been postponed this Sunday owing to the wave of hate crimes. The event has been organised by the Ireland India Council since 2015. A Ficci India Day event is going ahead in Dublin on Aug 17.Indian community leaders met Ireland deputy PM Simon Harris on Monday after which he condemned the “despicable acts of violence and racism”.Chairman of the Ireland India Council Prashant Shukla told Ireland AM: “We weren’t worried about the event itself as the Gardaí assured us about safety, but we were worried about the perception it could lead to further attacks. Our message to the Irish community is that these attacks are attacks on your economy and industry. Policing needs to go to the next level. I feel there are not proper investigations and arrests. We are all working, paying taxes and contributing to the economy. No one is getting a free house. People are spreading misinformation that Indians buying houses is causing house prices to go up.”President of Ireland Michael D Higgins on Tuesday also condemned the attacks. “A lot of Indians are reconsidering their choices and may move back to India if the situation doesn’t improve. It is mostly being caused by far-right groups encouraging teenagers to attack immigrants. Indians are the most visible immigrants here,” said Indian national Some Aditya Mandal, who has worked in Dublin for eight years.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle10 baby names that mean creativity and visionLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?Maharashtra’s UNESCO World Heritage Sites and other iconic monuments for history loversRajinikanth completes 50 years in cinema: Lesser-known facts about the ‘Coolie’ star6 lizards that prove reptiles can be adorableHow to unrot your brain: 5 effective steps to sharpen focus and boost mental clarityFrom Mullum Malarum to Kabali: Rajinikanth’s most emotional movies that fans still cherish123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

Dr Ajay Aggarwal, an Indian-origin pain medicine doctor from Houston, has agreed to pay over $2 million to resolve allegations of medical fraud against him, the US Justice Department revealed. Between 2021 and 2023, the 63-year-old doctor billed federally funded health care programs like Medicare and the Department of Labor’s Workers’ Compensation Programs for surgical implants that he never performed. Dr Aggarwal received thousands of dollars per procedure, but patients received simple devices which required no surgery. And all device placements used to take place at Aggarwal's clinic, not a hospital or surgical center. “A doctor who uses simple medical devices on his patients, yet bills Medicare for a sophisticated spinal surgery, is billing the American taxpayer, plain and simple,” said US Attorney Nicholas J Ganjei.. “The Southern District of Texas will ensure that losses to federally funded healthcare programs from fraudulent billing, like what happened here, are recouped and that wrongdoers are held accountable.”PollDoes the healthcare billing system need stricter monitoring to prevent fraud?YesNoA 2023 document of the DOJ revealed that earlier he was accused of giving unnecessary treatment to federal employees with federal workers' compensation benefits and his pharmacy Medley, which was officially owned by his wife, filed the prescriptions. An employee of Medley acted as a whistleblower and said that during his term of employment, he saw patients being sent unnecessary with unnecessary medications being prescribed. In some cases, the patients did not even see or meet Dr Aggarwal. And Medley employees were allegedly instructed to auto-fill medications on a monthly basis and to use pre-printed prescription pads to submit the prescriptions to DOL-OWCP without consideration of medical need. The new fraud of Dr Aggarwal came to be reported at a time when foreign doctors are under fire, while several Republican leaders said US needs more doctors and foreign doctors can fill the gap.

Indian-origin Dr Vinay Prasad returns to FDA weeks after exit
Dr Vinay Prasad, previously ousted from his FDA vaccine chief position due to criticism from Laura Loomer over past anti-Trump comments and drug approval decisions, has been reinstated. This unusual move suggests the influence of RFK Jr within the Trump administration despite pressure from right-wing activists. RFK Jr opposed anti-vaxxer Dr Prasad's exit and remained invested to bring him back.

This unusual move suggests the influence of RFK Jr within the Trump administration despite pressure from right-wing activists. RFK Jr opposed anti-vaxxer Dr Prasad's exit and remained invested to bring him back.  Dr Vinay Prasad is back at his FDA job weeks after exit that was prompted by right-wing activist Laura Loomer's campaigning against Prasad. Dr Vinay Prasad, the Indian-origin vaccine chief of the FDA who was forced to resign in July after far-right activist Laura Loomer led a campaign against him, has been reinstated to his job in an unusual instance. Laura Loomer pointed out the critical comments that Dr Prasad made about President Donald Trump before joining the administration, while some of his decisions to deny drug approvals also came under fire. A Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson confirmed to the New York Times that Dr Prasad is returning to the agency. “At the F.D.A.’s request, Dr. Vinay Prasad is resuming leadership of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research,” Andrew Nixon, a health department spokesman, said in a statement.The NYT report observed that Dr Prasad's rehiring suggests that the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr., and the FDA commissioner, Dr Marty Makary, remain influential enough in the Trump administration to employ someone who had previously expressed disdain for Trump and his followers.Loomer reacted to the reinstatement and called in another "egregious personnel decision". "In another egregious personnel decision under the Trump administration, it is now being reported that longtime progressive Marxist Vinay Prasad who referred to President Trump’s supporters as criminals and compared them to drug addicts after saying he stabbed a Trump voodoo doll to “curse Trump” is apparently back at FDA," Loomer wrote.RFK Jr tapped Dr Prasad in May when the previous head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation left the role. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Dr Prasad gained prominence as an outspoken critic of vaccines and mask mandate. In his short stint at the FDA since May, Dr Prasad limited the use of Covid-19 vaccines and promoted warnings about a rare side effect of the vaccines. When he resigned from his role weeks ago, a department spokesperson told the NYT: "Dr. Prasad did not want to be a distraction to the great work of the FDA in the Trump administration and has decided to return to California and spend more time with his family."Kennedy, however, opposed Prasad's departure from the role and remained invested in bringing him back. Dr Prasad was born and brought up in Ohio and Chicago to Indian immigrant parents.

An Indian-origin techie, Manasi Mishra, who graduated with a computer science degree from Purdue University, revealed in a TikTok video as she was getting ready that the only company that called her for an interview was Chipotle. Titled 'Chipotle Interview GRWM', the TikTok video went viral as she appealed 'somebody pls hire me'. In an interview with New York Times, after the video went viral, Mishra revealed that growing up near Silicon Valley, she was used to the narrative that if she learned to code, worked hard and studied computer science, she could get a six-figure starting salary. But recent graduates are finding it hard because of the spread of AI programming tools and also the recent layoffs at companies like Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft.The NYT story confirmed that Mishra did not get the burrito-making gig at Chipotle, and she finally found a sales position job at a tech company.Mishra's story and the NYT article triggered a major debate on the present job situation, layoff and how much of it should be blamed on foreign workers, AI etc. "This is why I really do feel for Gen Z. This young woman was told her whole life by every authority figure that she should study hard, do well in school, and pursue a career in tech. She went to Purdue, one of the best engineering schools in the country. She studied computer science, not gender ideology or basket weaving," one viral comment read on X. "And still she could not even get a job at Chipotle let alone in her field. She did literally everything “right” but, to what end? This situation is not sustainable. H1B and other work visas, as well as offshoring, are getting out of control and abusive. Policymakers should care about the young generation," the person wrote. Many people commented that the jobs that the Indian-origin person missed must have gone to people from India who are on H-1B.

(Photo: DailyEcho/Padharo) Ankit Vaghela, an Indian-origin restaurant owner in Southampton, was told by the police that they could not come to his 'Padharo' when he called 999 to report a break-in. The vandals broke in and fled with several bottles of expensive alcohol and cash but the police helpline asked them to email the CCTV footage of the three burglars who broke in last week.Vaghela decided to get proactive and review the footage first. He discovered his cash register without the cash, abandoned along with some smashed liquor bottles strewn on a nearby road. “It was very heartbreaking to be told that officers will be able to review the damage in three to five working days and that no forensics was available at the time,” said Vaghela.“There was glass everywhere. As a business, we can’t afford to remain closed and had to get things cleaned up and the glass fixed. We are still struggling to operate smoothly without a proper cash register, which will take time, but are determined to welcome our guests with the same level of service we are known for in the city,” he said.The Hampshire Police said they did not underestimate the July 31 case but they understood that their investigation could start without their immediate attendance at the site, as the offenders were not there. “Every deployment decision is based on informed risk assessments to make sure the most serious cases are prioritised, and officers are on scene where there is an immediate threat to life or a crime in action,” the police force said in a statement.“On this occasion, based on the initial information we were given regarding the offenders no longer being at the scene, our investigation could get underway without any immediate attendance. That investigation is progressing with lines of enquiry identified, such as CCTV, and we are in touch with the victim to provide them updates on our investigation,” added the statement, along with an appeal to the public for any information related to the burglary."It means nothing now, the damage is done. Officers were not willing to visit the restaurant," Vaghela told to local news outlets.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

TOI correspondent from London: A six-year-old Indian-origin girl and an Indian sous chef are the latest victims in the ongoing spate of racist attacks targeting Indian nationals and Indian-origin Irish people in Ireland.The girl, whose family hail from Kottayam, Kerala, was playing outside her house in Waterford City, southeast Ireland, with friends at 7.30pm on Monday evening when a gang of boys and one girl called her a “dirty Indian” and told her to “go back to India”. She was born in Ireland. Five of the gang also punched her in the face, hit her private parts with a bicycle, punched her neck and twisted her hair.Her mother moved to Ireland eight years ago from Kottayam to work as a nurse with her husband and recently became an Irish citizen.The mother said the gang was made up of boys aged 12 to 14 and a girl aged eight. She said her daughter came home in floods of tears and is now too scared to play outside. She told the Irish Mirror: “I never expected that such an incident would happen. I thought she would be safe here. Even in front of our own house she can’t play safely. I am a nurse, I am doing my best to take care of people. I do my work and I am 100% professional. I changed my citizenship, but still we are called dirty people and even my kids are not safe. We came here to fill a labour gap. We are professionals — we have all the certificates…”The mother studied BSc Nursing at University of Calicut and went to Mount Carmel Higher Secondary School in Kottayam.“Gardaí (Irish national police) responded to a report of an alleged assault in the Kilbarry area of Waterford city on the evening of Monday 4 August. Investigations are ongoing,” a Garda spokesperson told TOI.On Wednesday morning Laxman Das from Kolkata, who works as a sous chef at the Anantara The Marker Dublin hotel, was assaulted near the Hilton Hotel by three people while on his way to work. He was taken to St Vincent's University Hospital. His phone, cash and electric bike were stolen.These come following a spate of attacks against Indians in Ireland in recent weeks — on July 19, July 24, July 27, and on Aug 1 when a cab driver was assaulted.The Gardaí said they are still investigating these attacks and no one has been arrested.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning looks of Binny Sebastiantv10 baby names that mean ‘divine light’ or ‘sacred glow’Lifestyle10 Birds with the "wildest dating rituals"LifestyleRaksha Bandhan: 10 iconic lines of famous Hindi poets that capture essence of the festivalLifestyleKarishma Tanna Stuns with Style and SpiritEntertainmentFrom Moong to Chia Sprouts: How to grow your breakfast in balconyLifestyleBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Here’s how much each contestant earns dailytv10 creatures that survive in the deepest parts of the oceanLifestyleRaksha Bandhan: 10 quotes that describe the beautiful bond between brothers and sistersLifestyleHow to do step-by-step Ayurveda hair therapy at homeLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Threads of Love, Threads of Tradition: How different Indian states celebrate Raksha BandhanFrom chapatis to cake: 7 delicious ways to use overripe bananasInternational Cat Day 2025: From Persian to Bengal Cat-- 5 most beautiful and popular pet cat breeds in the world5 diseases moles on your body might indicate and should not be ignoredNot-so popular drinks that help in weightloss10 places in South Africa that aren’t to be missed in a lifetimeMemorable style outings of Princess CharlotteHow Kangana Ranaut turned fame into fearless politicsFrom ₹6 Lakh to ₹40 Lakh: A peek into Kamal Haasan’s ultra-luxe watch closetFrom Archana reacting to a hate comment to son Aaryamann revealing how he impressed girlfriend Yogita Bihani: Archana Puran Singh shares candid moments123Hot PicksGlobal Standard indexUS stocks todayIndia-US tariffIntel CEOMukesh AmbaniUS jobless dataRussia crude oilTop TrendingTom BradyDonald TrumpSouth Park EpisodeCall of DutyMalik BeasleyBattlefield 6 Beta OpensPrivate School in IndianaLuka Doncic Weight LossLinda McMahonLakers RumorsTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteUAE launches national programme to train Emiratis in space mission design and satellite engineering'PM Modi can't, shouldn't bend knee to Donald Trump': US tariffs on India draws rare bipartisan concern in US - watch'Enormous mistake': What Trump's former NSA John Bolton said on India tariffChild assault under false identity: Indian man commits suicide in US jail months after 35-year prison sentence, claim reportsLove gone wild: Indian man faces deportation for harassing UK zoo colleague for 6 months; didn’t stop even after restraining order'Before judging...': Wife of Pakistani man Salman Iftikhar who threatened Virgin Atlantic air hostess with gangrape defends outburstFriedrich Merz halts German military exports to Israel over Gaza issue; urges aid accessGround invasion in Gaza?

The arrest occurred due to possession of a fake resident card. Authorities took him into custody in Niagara Falls, New York. He faces a potential 10-year prison sentence. The arrest is part of 'Operation Take Back America'. This initiative targets illegal immigration.  An Indian national has been arrested in the United States for allegedly possessing a forged alien resident card, according to the Justice Department. Swapnil Ramesh Tejale, 34, was taken into custody following a traffic stop in Niagara Falls, New York, and now faces a federal charge that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.“On July 10, 2025, the Niagara Falls Border Patrol Station received a request from the Niagara Falls Police Department to help identify three individuals that they had encountered during a traffic stop,” said Assistant US Attorney Michael J. Smith, who is prosecuting the case. “Agents arrived at the scene and questioned the three individuals as to their citizenship. Tejale presented a Lawful Permanent Resident Card but voluntarily admitted that the card was fictitious.”Authorities later confirmed that Tejale was in the country unlawfully and did not possess any valid immigration documents. Following his arrest, agents discovered a Social Security card in his name, which was also found to be counterfeit.The case falls under “Operation Take Back America”, a Justice Department initiative aimed at tackling illegal immigration and dismantling transnational criminal organisations. The operation seeks to “repel the invasion of illegal immigration” and “protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime”, the department said.The investigation was led by the US Border Patrol Niagara Falls Station, under the direction of Patrol Agent in Charge Brady Waikal.Tejale’s arrest is part of a series of immigration enforcement actions involving Indian nationals this year. In a related incident, an Indian man from Santa Rosa, California, was sentenced in March to six months in prison for conspiracy to transport aliens for profit. Meanwhile, Manjot Singh, a 25-year-old Indian national, was recently arrested in the Seattle area for repeat offences including robbery, assault, and criminal impersonation. Singh, who entered the U.S. illegally, is currently in ICE custody pending deportation.ICE officials have said that Singh’s arrest is a warning to repeat offenders: “Those who violate US laws while in the country illegally face arrest and deportation.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Viral footage shows firefighters inspecting the scene as the family performed the ritual. (Photo: X) A housewarming ceremony involving a Hindu havan at a Texas home took an unexpected turn when local firefighters arrived at the scene, mistaking the ritual for a fire emergency.The incident was captured on video. The footage has gone viral and has fuelled an online debate over cultural awareness and fire safety. The clip was originally shared on Instagram. It shows a fire truck from the Bedford fire department pulling up outside the house as smoke from the ceremony fills the garage. Inside, an Indian family can be seen performing a traditional havan, a religious ritual involving fire, as part of their housewarming puja.The video includes on-screen text stating, "Cultural misunderstanding 101: A Hindu puja is not a fire emergency. When you're having a housewarming havan and the fire department pulls up."Shortly after the fire crew arrives, they are seen speaking with members of the family and inspecting the area. However, it remains unclear whether any formal action was taken or if any fire codes were violated during the ritual.The footage has since been widely circulated across social media platforms, with users offering differing views on the incident. Some social media users criticised the family for conducting a ritual involving fire in a residential setting, arguing it could pose safety risks. Others defended the family’s right to observe their religious customs, calling the incident a clear example of cultural misunderstanding.No official comment was immeditaely released by the Bedford fire department.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Indian-origin Mathura Sridharan was appointed as Ohio's 12th solicitor general, inviting the wrath of online trolls who questioned why a 'non-US-origin' person was not picked for the post. Sridharan's LinkedIn went viral as critics questioned her credibility -- forcing Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost to issue a clarification, or a clapback at the trolls. Dave Yost, who announced Mathura's promotion, said Mathura is wrongly being portrayed as a non-American. "A few commenters have asserted incorrectly that Mathura is not American. She is a United States citizen, married to a US citizen, and the child of naturalized US citizens," he said. "If her name or her complexion bother you, the problem is not with her or her appointment," he added."Mathura is brilliant… she won her argument at SCOTUS last year. Both the SGs she worked under (Flowers & Gaiser) recommended her. I told her when I originally hired her I needed her to argue with me. She does… All the time! Excited to promote her. She will serve Ohio well," Yost wrote.Yost's clapback also met trolling as people commented that she is not "American-American". "Is she a Christian? That’s the biggest factor that concerns me. Based on the bindi on her forehead, I worry she is not," one wrote. "Another American job… given away to foreigners," another wrote. "She's Indian. They all have a loyalty first to other Indians. horrible pick. Totally un-American. the GOP is pathetic," a third user wrote."No one with the last name 'Sridharan' fought in the US Civil War. She's not an American," another wrote.Before joining the Ohio Solicitor’s Office, Mathura clerked for Judge Steven J. Menashi of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and Judge Deborah A. Batts of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York.

Ravishankar was the chief digital officer of Air New Zealand before getting the major promotion which is the first for an Indian-origin person in the country.New Zealand Herald, Radio New Zealand, 1News said they had to disable comments as they can't allow hatred. The New Zealand Herald issued a statement in which it clarified that there were several racist comments owing to which they had to take the extreme step. "We appreciate the high level of interest in this story but cannot safely moderate it at this time," the news outlet said in a post in the comment thread."We want to foster a safe online community by reducing instances of hate, racism, abuse and misinformation. We welcome your feedback on articles but there has to be some parameters, and these are explained in our community house rules...We cannot tolerate hate. We cannot tolerate abuse towards individuals in our stories or other commenters," the company's social media policy says. Radio New Zealand had to do the same on the social media post on Ravishankar's appointment. "Under RNZ's comments policy, we will proactively disable comments on posts which may attract abusive or harmful comments or when resources are required elsewhere," a spokesperson for RNZ said. "In this instance, the comments were disabled after our monitoring found racist comments," the spokesperson said. "We want people to feel safe and respected on our community forums and will continue to proactively disable comments where necessary. We will not tolerate harmful communications."1News said it received a large number of comments on the post that announced Ravishankar's appointment and a vast majority were inappropriate. Who is Nikhil Ravishankar?Nikhil Ravishankar was born in India but brought up in New Zealand. He studied in New Zealand -- holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) from the University of Auckland. Before joining Air New Zealand, Ravishankar was Chief Digital Officer at Vector New Zealand (from 2017), and also worked as a Managing Director at Accenture across Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand, and in senior technology roles at Spark (formerly Telecom NZ).About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

After her TikTok video went viral, another ICE official offered help. Chatterjee highlights the broader issue of poor ICE communication, impacting immigrants facing detention and difficult bond policies, leading some to abandon their asylum claims. Trisha Chatterjee (Picture source: LinkedIn) Trisha Chatterjee, an Indian-origin immigration lawyer in Ohio, has alleged she was given the number of a Taco Bell outlet when she called ICE for urgent client support. Chatterjee posted about the incident on TikTok, where it went viral and ultimately led to help from another ICE official. But she says the larger issue lack of clear access to immigration authorities continues to cause serious harm to her clients."I called and they answered and they said, 'Hello, Taco Bell?' And I said, 'Taco Bell?' And the guy who was working said, 'Yeah, Taco Bell. Ma'am, you called me," Chatterjee recalled."I was in such disbelief," she said. "So, I called the ICE officer back, just really frustrated with what had just happened. He says, 'Oh, I'm sorry. I was trying to lighten the mood and make you laugh.'"ICE has denied the accusation. Homeland security called it a “lie and a smear.” Chatterjee stood by her version of events.Who is Trisha Chatterjee? Trisha Chatterjee is an Indian-origin immigration lawyer based in Greater Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio. She graduated from Miami University in 2020 and the University of Dayton School of Law in 2023.She works with the law office of Emily Feliz Garcia, a small immigration firm in Springdale. Before this, she worked at Abdallah law offices.For the last two years, she has handled immigration cases, especially those involving clients detained at the Butler County Jail in Ohio, which has a contract with ICE.Chatterjee was trying to submit "stay of removal" applications—urgent paperwork that can pause deportation for clients with pending immigration cases. ICE requires these to be submitted in person at the Detroit field office, but she hoped to file them locally in Blue Ash.After being unable to reach anyone by phone or email, she finally spoke to an ICE officer who gave her a phone number that turned out to be for Taco Bell. When she called back, the officer reportedly said he was trying to make her laugh.She posted a video about the incident on TikTok, which gained over 38,000 views. Many users sympathised, and one even helped her connect with a helpful ICE official in Blue Ash, who is now assisting her.Chatterjee said the larger problem is the lack of access and communication with ICE. She also highlighted how a stricter bond policy is making it harder for immigrants to stay out of detention during legal proceedings. Bonds can cost up to $50,000 and must be paid upfront.According to Chatterjee, some clients are abandoning their asylum cases or choosing to self-deport out of fear. She mentioned recent local arrests of people attending ICE check-ins, which has only deepened anxiety in immigrant communities.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani faces criticism for visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam due to his past support for defunding the police. Critics accuse Mamdani of shifting his stance for political gain, especially after his 2020 tweets resurfaced. Mamdani defends his actions, clarifying his current position on public safety and police funding. Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is facing backlash after visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam, as critics pointed to his past 2020 tweet supporting "defund the police" stance.The controversy erupted after Mamdani, who recently returned from a trip to Uganda, visited the grieving family of officer Islam, one of four victims killed in a mass shooting in Midtown Manhattan. Zohran Mamdani’s SECRET Wedding Triggers Fury Amid Local Tragedy | WATCHThe shooter, Shane Tamura, opened fire on Monday, killing Islam and three others before shooting himself.Sharing a post on X, Mamdani wrote: “Two days ago, an act of senseless violence took the lives of Officer Didarul Islam, Wesley LePatner, Aland Etienne, and Julia Hyman. Today, I visited Officer Islam's family and learned of his legacy. I ask you to join me in honoring the memory of these four New Yorkers.”However, the post quickly drew criticism, with users referencing Mamdani’s previous tweets during the height of the “Defund the Police” movement in 2020.Many accused him of changing his stance for political gain. One user wrote, “You can't go from defund the police to never mind I love the police. You're asking New Yorkers to forgo their guns meanwhile you just had a wedding in Uganda with armed guards.”While another posted, “Zohran Mamdani exposed as a total fraud. Mocking cops, calling them racist, then acting like he cares? No loyalty to America. He belongs in Uganda, not leading NYC. Deport him and protect our city!”Earlier at a press conference following his visit to the officer’s home in The Bronx, Mamdani addressed the criticism and attempted to clarify his position saying: “I am not defunding the police; I am not running to defund the police.”“Over the course of this race, I’ve been very clear about my view of public safety and the critical role that the police have in creating that public safety,” he added.Standing alongside members of the Bangladeshi American Police Association—of which Officer Islam was a member—and labor union 32BJ, which represented another victim, Aland Etienne, Mamdani tried to strike a unifying tone.During the peak of the "Defund the Police" movement in 2020, Zohran Mamdani repeatedly called for major cuts to the NYPD budget. In one post, he wrote, “We don’t need an investigation to know that the NYPD is racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety. What we need is to #DefundTheNYPD.”In another, he said, “There is no negotiating with an institution this wicked & corrupt. Defund it. Dismantle it. End the cycle of violence,” referencing budget talks around proposed NYPD cuts.Now, Mamdani has distanced himself from those remarks. When asked about them, he responded, “My statements in 2020 were made amidst a frustration that many New Yorkers held at the murder of George Floyd.”Mamdani claimed that his current stance is more nuanced, stating that his previous posts were “clearly out of step” with his recent campaign platform. He now supports maintaining the NYPD headcount while reducing its overtime budget.Despite this clarification, skepticism remains. Many police officers and political observers have accused Mamdani of shifting positions purely for political gain in a city where public safety remains a top concern for voters, New York Post reported.Adding to the political firestorm, former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams, who are both trailing Mamdani in early polling for the 2025 mayoral race, weighed in shortly after the shooting. Mamdani fired back, accusing Cuomo of politicising the tragedy saying, “It is beyond me that politicians are looking to use these days to score such cynical political points, on the very day that I held the father of Officer Islam in my arms and he could not utter a single word.”“For the former governor to spend an entire day speaking almost exclusively about me and barely about the New Yorkers who have been killed is indicative of the very politics New Yorkers want to leave in the past,” he added.All three, Mamdani, Cuomo, and Adams are expected to attend officer Islam’s funeral on Thursday.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The high court found him guilty of rape and outrage of modesty, following incidents at his Jurong West shop in 2021. Despite his denials and claims of erectile dysfunction, the judge deemed the victim's testimony credible.  An Indian national was sentenced to more than 14 years in jail on Thursday by the Singapore high court for sexually assaulting a minor, reports the Straits Times.Ramalingam Selvasekaran was handed a sentence of 14 years, three months and two weeks after being found guilty of rape and two counts of outrage of modesty after assaulting an 11-year-old at his provision shop in Jurong West.According to the court, the assaults occurred between 4.50 pm and 5.05 pm on October 28, 2021. The girl had visited Ramalingam’s store and returned later to buy ice cream. Prosecutors said he led her into a back area and forced her to perform oral sex. After the incident, the girl sought help from a passerby, who called the police.Ramalingam represented himself during the trial, which began on January 16. He was convicted on all charges on 7 July.“The fact that she had not run off after the first act of molest, or that she did not resist the assaults, or inform her grandfather, were all to my mind sufficiently explained, particularly given that she was still young and immature,” said Justice Aidan Xu, who found the girl’s account credible and consistent.Ramalingam’s earlier statements to police reportedly included admissions of hugging, kissing, and oral sex. However, he later denied any wrongdoing, claiming he was suffering from erectile dysfunction and that no DNA evidence was found on the victim.The judge ruled that these claims did not undermine the girl’s testimony. “While there was no dispute that Ramalingam suffered from erectile dysfunction, the prosecution’s expert witness gave a cogent explanation that oral rape remained possible,” Justice Xu was quoted as saying to Straits Times.Following sentencing on July 30, Ramalingam said he would appeal and was granted bail of S$80,000. He attempted to negotiate with the judge over the conditions, asking for the removal of his electronic tag and exemption from reporting to the Police Cantonment Complex. Both requests were denied.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

A Hindu temple in Melbourne’s eastern suburb of Boronia was defaced with racist graffiti this week prompting widespread condemnation and police investigation.As reported by The Brisbane Times and The Sydney Morning Herald, offensive red graffiti with the words “Go home” and other racial slurs were found daubed across the Shree Swaminarayan Temple on Wadhurst Drive, as well as two nearby Asian-operated restaurants Kingsland Chinese Restaurant and Charles King Dumpling.Police said a healing centre on Mountain Highway was also defaced the same night, bringing the total number of sites attacked to four. “There is absolutely no place at all in our society for hate-based and racist behaviour,” Victoria Police said in a statement. Authorities confirmed that all four incidents are being treated as linked and that an investigation is under way.PollShould harsher penalties be implemented for hate crimes?Yes, definitelyNo, current laws are sufficient'An attack on our right to worship'Makrand Bhagwat, President of the Hindu Council of Australia’s Victoria chapter, told Australia Today the vandalism of the temple was “heartbreaking” for the community. “Our temple is meant to be a sanctuary of peace, devotion and unity,” he said. “To have it targeted in this way feels like an attack on our identity, our right to worship and freedom of religion.”Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan sent a personal message of support to temple management. “What happened this week was hateful, racist and deeply disturbing,” she wrote. “It wasn’t just vandalism – it was a deliberate act of hate, designed to intimidate, isolate, and spread fear.”Local interfaith networks, including the City of Greater Knox’s Multifaith Network, have expressed support. “We want to show that love and solidarity triumph over hate,” said community leader Vikrant Thakur.Indian man targeted in racist attackThis came after a 23-year-old Indian man, Charanpreet Singh, was brutally attacked and left unconscious on a street in Adelaide following a reported racist assault linked to a parking dispute. According to 9News, the men allegedly told Singh to "f--- off, Indian" before launching a violent, unprovoked assault.“They just said ‘f--- off, Indian’, and after that they just started punching,” Singh said. “I tried to fight back, but they beat me until I was unconscious.”He sustained serious injuries, including brain trauma and facial fractures. A 20-year-old from Enfield was arrested and charged, but others involved remain at large.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Singh and his wife were allegedly ambushed by a group of men who shouted racial slurs before inflicting serious injuries. The incident has sparked outrage and renewed calls for enhanced safety measures for international students in the area.  An Indian international student has been hospitalised with serious injuries after a violent assault in Australia's Adelaide that is being investigated as a possible racially motivated attack. The incident has sparked outrage across the Indian community and renewed calls for better safety measures for international students.Charanpreet Singh, 23, was with his wife near Kintore Avenue on Saturday evening (July 19) when they were allegedly ambushed by a group of five men. According to Australia Today, the couple had just parked their car to view the city’s light displays around 9:22pm when the attackers emerged from another vehicle.Viral video shows assaultEyewitnesses and video footage shared on social media reportedly show the men striking Singh with what appeared to be metal knuckles or sharp objects, while shouting racial abuse including: “F--- off, Indian”. The attackers then fled the scene, leaving Singh unconscious and seriously injured on the road.PollWhat should be prioritized to improve safety for international students?Awareness campaigns and community supportStronger law enforcement and quicker actionSingh, who spoke to 9News from his hospital bed, said the altercation began over a car parking dispute but escalated into a racially charged assault. “They just said, ‘F--- off, Indian,’ and after that they just started punching,” he recalled. “You can change anything in your body, but you can’t change the colours.”He sustained facial fractures and brain trauma, and was taken by emergency services to the Royal Adelaide Hospital for overnight treatment. The assault has left members of the local Indian community shaken, with many expressing solidarity with Singh online.“When things like this happen, it makes you feel like you should go back,” Singh said.Police investigation under waySouth Australia Police confirmed they were called to Kintore Avenue shortly before 9.30pm and found Singh with facial injuries. “He was taken to hospital for treatment. Investigations are continuing,” a police spokesperson told The Indian Sun. One man, a 20-year-old from Enfield, has been arrested and charged with assault causing harm. The other suspects remain at large.Authorities are reviewing CCTV footage from the area and have urged witnesses to come forward. “We ask anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers,” the police said.Premier Peter Malinauskas has condemned the incident, calling it “completely unwelcome in our state”. He added, “Any time we see any evidence of any racial attack, it is just not consistent with where the majority of our community are at.”Another attack in DublinThis follows another attack targeting an Indian individual. An Indian man in his 40s was hospitalised after being brutally attacked by a group of teenage boys in a violent, racist assault in Dublin on Saturday evening. The gang falsely accused him of inappropriate behaviour with children before beating him and pulling down his trousers. “Gardaí in Tallaght were alerted to an incident at Parkhill Road... Investigations are ongoing,” police said. Councillor Baby Pereppadan said, “He couldn’t speak much because of the shock.” Sinn Féin’s Seán Crowe added, “You are sowing hate, fear, and division.” A protest is planned for July 26 to condemn rising racist violence in Ireland.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Her exit, surprising to many, opens an opportunity for the U.S. Treasury to propose a successor amidst global trade dynamic shifts. Gopinath, the first female chief economist, joined the IMF in 2019 and was promoted in 2022. Gita Gopinath (File photo) NEW DELHI: Gita Gopinath, the second-in-command at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), will step down at the end of August to return to her position at Harvard University, the IMF announced on Monday.The timing of Gita Gopinath’s exit has taken many within the IMF by surprise and is believed to have been prompted by her own decision, reported news agency Reuters. Having originally left Harvard to serve at the Fund, she is now set to resume her role as professor of economics at the university. Her departure opens a window for the US Treasury to propose a successor—an opportunity that comes as President Donald Trump pushes to reshape global trade dynamics and curb the country’s persistent trade deficits through sweeping tariffs on imports worldwide. Gopinath, who joined the IMF in 2019 as its first-ever female chief economist, was elevated to First Deputy Managing Director in January 2022. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva will appoint her successor “in due course,” the statement added.Gopinath had served as the first female chief economist of the Washington-based global lender for three years. Gopinath's research has been published in many top economics journals. Prior to her appointment as IMF Chief Economist, she was the John Zwaanstra Professor of International Studies and Economics in the economics department of Harvard University. Before joining the faculty of Harvard University in 2005, she was an assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.Gopinath, who considers herself a product of the Indian education system, she completed her schooling in Mysuru. She had her first brush with macro-economic challenges while doing her bachelor’s degree at Lady Shri Ram College, Delhi, with India experiencing its first major external financing and currency crisis in 1990-91. “This inspired me to pursue graduate work in economics and was the foundation for my interest in international finance,” she had told in an interview in 2010.Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.AI Masterclass for Students.

One of the group took his metal water bottle and hit him above the eye, causing heavy bleeding. He was taken to hospital where he received eight stitches. Gardaí confirmed they are investigating the assault and his injuries are “non-life threatening”.An Indian-origin woman has put a post on Reddit saying her 60-year-old father was harassed by boys, aged around seven and eight, who tried to take his wallet at a bus stop in Dublin on Aug 9.These are just the latest in a string of racist attacks targeting Indians in Ireland which have left the Indian community terrified to step outside.India Day in Ireland, which celebrates the country’s cultural ties, has been postponed this Sunday owing to the wave of hate crimes. The event has been organised by the Ireland India Council since 2015. A Ficci India Day event is going ahead in Dublin on Aug 17.Indian community leaders met Ireland deputy PM Simon Harris on Monday after which he condemned the “despicable acts of violence and racism”.Chairman of the Ireland India Council Prashant Shukla told Ireland AM: “We weren’t worried about the event itself as the Gardaí assured us about safety, but we were worried about the perception it could lead to further attacks. Our message to the Irish community is that these attacks are attacks on your economy and industry. Policing needs to go to the next level. I feel there are not proper investigations and arrests. We are all working, paying taxes and contributing to the economy. No one is getting a free house. People are spreading misinformation that Indians buying houses is causing house prices to go up.”President of Ireland Michael D Higgins on Tuesday also condemned the attacks. “A lot of Indians are reconsidering their choices and may move back to India if the situation doesn’t improve. It is mostly being caused by far-right groups encouraging teenagers to attack immigrants. Indians are the most visible immigrants here,” said Indian national Some Aditya Mandal, who has worked in Dublin for eight years.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle10 baby names that mean creativity and visionLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Can root canal treatment cause Breast Cancer? 5 facts to knowChitrangda Singh's powerful performances and personal moments that touched heartsOne cup boiled egg vs one cup paneer: Which has more protein and how to eatFrom New York to Miami: Cities in the U.S. every party lover should visit before hitting 40!Why do Bengalis start their meal with something as bitter as Neem Begun?Maharashtra’s UNESCO World Heritage Sites and other iconic monuments for history loversRajinikanth completes 50 years in cinema: Lesser-known facts about the ‘Coolie’ star6 lizards that prove reptiles can be adorableHow to unrot your brain: 5 effective steps to sharpen focus and boost mental clarityFrom Mullum Malarum to Kabali: Rajinikanth’s most emotional movies that fans still cherish123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillCardi BTaylor Swift New Heights PodcastGabrielle UnionPatrick MahomesShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteCiara becomes first to receive Benin citizenship under new descendants lawGovt tightens OCI rules: Overseas citizenship holders risk losing status;

Dr Ajay Aggarwal, an Indian-origin pain medicine doctor from Houston, has agreed to pay over $2 million to resolve allegations of medical fraud against him, the US Justice Department revealed. Between 2021 and 2023, the 63-year-old doctor billed federally funded health care programs like Medicare and the Department of Labor’s Workers’ Compensation Programs for surgical implants that he never performed. Dr Aggarwal received thousands of dollars per procedure, but patients received simple devices which required no surgery. And all device placements used to take place at Aggarwal's clinic, not a hospital or surgical center. “A doctor who uses simple medical devices on his patients, yet bills Medicare for a sophisticated spinal surgery, is billing the American taxpayer, plain and simple,” said US Attorney Nicholas J Ganjei.. “The Southern District of Texas will ensure that losses to federally funded healthcare programs from fraudulent billing, like what happened here, are recouped and that wrongdoers are held accountable.”PollDoes the healthcare billing system need stricter monitoring to prevent fraud?YesNoA 2023 document of the DOJ revealed that earlier he was accused of giving unnecessary treatment to federal employees with federal workers' compensation benefits and his pharmacy Medley, which was officially owned by his wife, filed the prescriptions. An employee of Medley acted as a whistleblower and said that during his term of employment, he saw patients being sent unnecessary with unnecessary medications being prescribed. In some cases, the patients did not even see or meet Dr Aggarwal. And Medley employees were allegedly instructed to auto-fill medications on a monthly basis and to use pre-printed prescription pads to submit the prescriptions to DOL-OWCP without consideration of medical need. The new fraud of Dr Aggarwal came to be reported at a time when foreign doctors are under fire, while several Republican leaders said US needs more doctors and foreign doctors can fill the gap.

The OCI card can also be revoked if they are charge-sheeted for an offense that carries a potential jail term of seven years or more, according to a recent notification.  Indian-origin foreign nationals holding an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card could now lose it if they face serious criminal charges or convictions, the government has announced.In a fresh gazette notification, the ministry of home affairs said that the OCI registration will be cancelled if the holder is sentenced to imprisonment for two years or more, or is named in a charge sheet for an offence carrying a jail term of seven years or more."In exercise of the powers conferred by the clause (da) of section 7D of the Citizenship Act, 1955 (57 of 1955), the central government hereby states that an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) registration shall be liable to get cancelled when a person has been sentenced to imprisonment for term of not less than two years or has been charge-sheeted for an offence entailing punishment of imprisonment for seven years or more," the notification said, as cited by PTI.PollShould stricter rules be applied to Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) cardholders?NoYesThe OCI card allows Indian-origin foreign nationals to visit India without a visa. The scheme, introduced in August 2005, enables registration as OCI for all persons of Indian origin who were citizens of India on January 26, 1950 or later, or were eligible to become citizens on that date, except for those who are, or have been, citizens of Pakistan, Bangladesh or any other country specified by the government in the official gazette.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Indian-origin Dr Vinay Prasad returns to FDA weeks after exit
Dr Vinay Prasad, previously ousted from his FDA vaccine chief position due to criticism from Laura Loomer over past anti-Trump comments and drug approval decisions, has been reinstated. This unusual move suggests the influence of RFK Jr within the Trump administration despite pressure from right-wing activists. RFK Jr opposed anti-vaxxer Dr Prasad's exit and remained invested to bring him back.

This unusual move suggests the influence of RFK Jr within the Trump administration despite pressure from right-wing activists. RFK Jr opposed anti-vaxxer Dr Prasad's exit and remained invested to bring him back.  Dr Vinay Prasad is back at his FDA job weeks after exit that was prompted by right-wing activist Laura Loomer's campaigning against Prasad. Dr Vinay Prasad, the Indian-origin vaccine chief of the FDA who was forced to resign in July after far-right activist Laura Loomer led a campaign against him, has been reinstated to his job in an unusual instance. Laura Loomer pointed out the critical comments that Dr Prasad made about President Donald Trump before joining the administration, while some of his decisions to deny drug approvals also came under fire. A Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson confirmed to the New York Times that Dr Prasad is returning to the agency. “At the F.D.A.’s request, Dr. Vinay Prasad is resuming leadership of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research,” Andrew Nixon, a health department spokesman, said in a statement.The NYT report observed that Dr Prasad's rehiring suggests that the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr., and the FDA commissioner, Dr Marty Makary, remain influential enough in the Trump administration to employ someone who had previously expressed disdain for Trump and his followers.Loomer reacted to the reinstatement and called in another "egregious personnel decision". "In another egregious personnel decision under the Trump administration, it is now being reported that longtime progressive Marxist Vinay Prasad who referred to President Trump’s supporters as criminals and compared them to drug addicts after saying he stabbed a Trump voodoo doll to “curse Trump” is apparently back at FDA," Loomer wrote.RFK Jr tapped Dr Prasad in May when the previous head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation left the role. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Dr Prasad gained prominence as an outspoken critic of vaccines and mask mandate. In his short stint at the FDA since May, Dr Prasad limited the use of Covid-19 vaccines and promoted warnings about a rare side effect of the vaccines. When he resigned from his role weeks ago, a department spokesperson told the NYT: "Dr. Prasad did not want to be a distraction to the great work of the FDA in the Trump administration and has decided to return to California and spend more time with his family."Kennedy, however, opposed Prasad's departure from the role and remained invested in bringing him back. Dr Prasad was born and brought up in Ohio and Chicago to Indian immigrant parents.

An Indian-origin techie, Manasi Mishra, who graduated with a computer science degree from Purdue University, revealed in a TikTok video as she was getting ready that the only company that called her for an interview was Chipotle. Titled 'Chipotle Interview GRWM', the TikTok video went viral as she appealed 'somebody pls hire me'. In an interview with New York Times, after the video went viral, Mishra revealed that growing up near Silicon Valley, she was used to the narrative that if she learned to code, worked hard and studied computer science, she could get a six-figure starting salary. But recent graduates are finding it hard because of the spread of AI programming tools and also the recent layoffs at companies like Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft.The NYT story confirmed that Mishra did not get the burrito-making gig at Chipotle, and she finally found a sales position job at a tech company.Mishra's story and the NYT article triggered a major debate on the present job situation, layoff and how much of it should be blamed on foreign workers, AI etc. "This is why I really do feel for Gen Z. This young woman was told her whole life by every authority figure that she should study hard, do well in school, and pursue a career in tech. She went to Purdue, one of the best engineering schools in the country. She studied computer science, not gender ideology or basket weaving," one viral comment read on X. "And still she could not even get a job at Chipotle let alone in her field. She did literally everything “right” but, to what end? This situation is not sustainable. H1B and other work visas, as well as offshoring, are getting out of control and abusive. Policymakers should care about the young generation," the person wrote. Many people commented that the jobs that the Indian-origin person missed must have gone to people from India who are on H-1B.

(Photo: DailyEcho/Padharo) Ankit Vaghela, an Indian-origin restaurant owner in Southampton, was told by the police that they could not come to his 'Padharo' when he called 999 to report a break-in. The vandals broke in and fled with several bottles of expensive alcohol and cash but the police helpline asked them to email the CCTV footage of the three burglars who broke in last week.Vaghela decided to get proactive and review the footage first. He discovered his cash register without the cash, abandoned along with some smashed liquor bottles strewn on a nearby road. “It was very heartbreaking to be told that officers will be able to review the damage in three to five working days and that no forensics was available at the time,” said Vaghela.“There was glass everywhere. As a business, we can’t afford to remain closed and had to get things cleaned up and the glass fixed. We are still struggling to operate smoothly without a proper cash register, which will take time, but are determined to welcome our guests with the same level of service we are known for in the city,” he said.The Hampshire Police said they did not underestimate the July 31 case but they understood that their investigation could start without their immediate attendance at the site, as the offenders were not there. “Every deployment decision is based on informed risk assessments to make sure the most serious cases are prioritised, and officers are on scene where there is an immediate threat to life or a crime in action,” the police force said in a statement.“On this occasion, based on the initial information we were given regarding the offenders no longer being at the scene, our investigation could get underway without any immediate attendance. That investigation is progressing with lines of enquiry identified, such as CCTV, and we are in touch with the victim to provide them updates on our investigation,” added the statement, along with an appeal to the public for any information related to the burglary."It means nothing now, the damage is done.

In a separate incident, Laxman Das, an Indian sous chef in Dublin, was attacked and robbed while going to work. These incidents follow a series of recent assaults targeting Indians in Ireland, raising concerns about racism.  TOI correspondent from London: A six-year-old Indian-origin girl and an Indian sous chef are the latest victims in the ongoing spate of racist attacks targeting Indian nationals and Indian-origin Irish people in Ireland.The girl, whose family hail from Kottayam, Kerala, was playing outside her house in Waterford City, southeast Ireland, with friends at 7.30pm on Monday evening when a gang of boys and one girl called her a “dirty Indian” and told her to “go back to India”. She was born in Ireland. Five of the gang also punched her in the face, hit her private parts with a bicycle, punched her neck and twisted her hair.Her mother moved to Ireland eight years ago from Kottayam to work as a nurse with her husband and recently became an Irish citizen.The mother said the gang was made up of boys aged 12 to 14 and a girl aged eight. She said her daughter came home in floods of tears and is now too scared to play outside. She told the Irish Mirror: “I never expected that such an incident would happen. I thought she would be safe here. Even in front of our own house she can’t play safely. I am a nurse, I am doing my best to take care of people. I do my work and I am 100% professional. I changed my citizenship, but still we are called dirty people and even my kids are not safe. We came here to fill a labour gap. We are professionals — we have all the certificates…”The mother studied BSc Nursing at University of Calicut and went to Mount Carmel Higher Secondary School in Kottayam.“Gardaí (Irish national police) responded to a report of an alleged assault in the Kilbarry area of Waterford city on the evening of Monday 4 August. Investigations are ongoing,” a Garda spokesperson told TOI.On Wednesday morning Laxman Das from Kolkata, who works as a sous chef at the Anantara The Marker Dublin hotel, was assaulted near the Hilton Hotel by three people while on his way to work. He was taken to St Vincent's University Hospital. His phone, cash and electric bike were stolen.These come following a spate of attacks against Indians in Ireland in recent weeks — on July 19, July 24, July 27, and on Aug 1 when a cab driver was assaulted.The Gardaí said they are still investigating these attacks and no one has been arrested.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Stunning looks of Binny Sebastiantv10 baby names that mean ‘divine light’ or ‘sacred glow’Lifestyle10 Birds with the "wildest dating rituals"LifestyleRaksha Bandhan: 10 iconic lines of famous Hindi poets that capture essence of the festivalLifestyleKarishma Tanna Stuns with Style and SpiritEntertainmentFrom Moong to Chia Sprouts: How to grow your breakfast in balconyLifestyleBigg Boss Malayalam 7: Here’s how much each contestant earns dailytv10 creatures that survive in the deepest parts of the oceanLifestyleRaksha Bandhan: 10 quotes that describe the beautiful bond between brothers and sistersLifestyleHow to do step-by-step Ayurveda hair therapy at homeLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Threads of Love, Threads of Tradition: How different Indian states celebrate Raksha BandhanFrom chapatis to cake: 7 delicious ways to use overripe bananasInternational Cat Day 2025: From Persian to Bengal Cat-- 5 most beautiful and popular pet cat breeds in the world5 diseases moles on your body might indicate and should not be ignoredNot-so popular drinks that help in weightloss10 places in South Africa that aren’t to be missed in a lifetimeMemorable style outings of Princess CharlotteHow Kangana Ranaut turned fame into fearless politicsFrom ₹6 Lakh to ₹40 Lakh: A peek into Kamal Haasan’s ultra-luxe watch closetFrom Archana reacting to a hate comment to son Aaryamann revealing how he impressed girlfriend Yogita Bihani: Archana Puran Singh shares candid moments123Hot PicksGlobal Standard indexUS stocks todayIndia-US tariffIntel CEOMukesh AmbaniUS jobless dataRussia crude oilTop TrendingTom BradyDonald TrumpSouth Park EpisodeCall of DutyMalik BeasleyBattlefield 6 Beta OpensPrivate School in IndianaLuka Doncic Weight LossLinda McMahonLakers RumorsTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn WorldEntire WebsiteUAE launches national programme to train Emiratis in space mission design and satellite engineering'PM Modi can't, shouldn't bend knee to Donald Trump': US tariffs on India draws rare bipartisan concern in US - watch'Enormous mistake': What Trump's former NSA John Bolton said on India tariffChild assault under false identity: Indian man commits suicide in US jail months after 35-year prison sentence, claim reportsLove gone wild: Indian man faces deportation for harassing UK zoo colleague for 6 months; didn’t stop even after restraining order'Before judging...': Wife of Pakistani man Salman Iftikhar who threatened Virgin Atlantic air hostess with gangrape defends outburstFriedrich Merz halts German military exports to Israel over Gaza issue; urges aid accessGround invasion in Gaza?

The arrest occurred due to possession of a fake resident card. Authorities took him into custody in Niagara Falls, New York. He faces a potential 10-year prison sentence. The arrest is part of 'Operation Take Back America'. This initiative targets illegal immigration.  An Indian national has been arrested in the United States for allegedly possessing a forged alien resident card, according to the Justice Department. Swapnil Ramesh Tejale, 34, was taken into custody following a traffic stop in Niagara Falls, New York, and now faces a federal charge that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.“On July 10, 2025, the Niagara Falls Border Patrol Station received a request from the Niagara Falls Police Department to help identify three individuals that they had encountered during a traffic stop,” said Assistant US Attorney Michael J. Smith, who is prosecuting the case. “Agents arrived at the scene and questioned the three individuals as to their citizenship. Tejale presented a Lawful Permanent Resident Card but voluntarily admitted that the card was fictitious.”Authorities later confirmed that Tejale was in the country unlawfully and did not possess any valid immigration documents. Following his arrest, agents discovered a Social Security card in his name, which was also found to be counterfeit.The case falls under “Operation Take Back America”, a Justice Department initiative aimed at tackling illegal immigration and dismantling transnational criminal organisations. The operation seeks to “repel the invasion of illegal immigration” and “protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime”, the department said.The investigation was led by the US Border Patrol Niagara Falls Station, under the direction of Patrol Agent in Charge Brady Waikal.Tejale’s arrest is part of a series of immigration enforcement actions involving Indian nationals this year. In a related incident, an Indian man from Santa Rosa, California, was sentenced in March to six months in prison for conspiracy to transport aliens for profit. Meanwhile, Manjot Singh, a 25-year-old Indian national, was recently arrested in the Seattle area for repeat offences including robbery, assault, and criminal impersonation. Singh, who entered the U.S. illegally, is currently in ICE custody pending deportation.ICE officials have said that Singh’s arrest is a warning to repeat offenders: “Those who violate US laws while in the country illegally face arrest and deportation.”About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Viral footage shows firefighters inspecting the scene as the family performed the ritual. (Photo: X) A housewarming ceremony involving a Hindu havan at a Texas home took an unexpected turn when local firefighters arrived at the scene, mistaking the ritual for a fire emergency.The incident was captured on video. The footage has gone viral and has fuelled an online debate over cultural awareness and fire safety. The clip was originally shared on Instagram. It shows a fire truck from the Bedford fire department pulling up outside the house as smoke from the ceremony fills the garage. Inside, an Indian family can be seen performing a traditional havan, a religious ritual involving fire, as part of their housewarming puja.The video includes on-screen text stating, "Cultural misunderstanding 101: A Hindu puja is not a fire emergency. When you're having a housewarming havan and the fire department pulls up."Shortly after the fire crew arrives, they are seen speaking with members of the family and inspecting the area. However, it remains unclear whether any formal action was taken or if any fire codes were violated during the ritual.The footage has since been widely circulated across social media platforms, with users offering differing views on the incident. Some social media users criticised the family for conducting a ritual involving fire in a residential setting, arguing it could pose safety risks.

Indian-origin Mathura Sridharan was appointed as Ohio's 12th solicitor general, inviting the wrath of online trolls who questioned why a 'non-US-origin' person was not picked for the post. Sridharan's LinkedIn went viral as critics questioned her credibility -- forcing Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost to issue a clarification, or a clapback at the trolls. Dave Yost, who announced Mathura's promotion, said Mathura is wrongly being portrayed as a non-American. "A few commenters have asserted incorrectly that Mathura is not American. She is a United States citizen, married to a US citizen, and the child of naturalized US citizens," he said. "If her name or her complexion bother you, the problem is not with her or her appointment," he added."Mathura is brilliant… she won her argument at SCOTUS last year. Both the SGs she worked under (Flowers & Gaiser) recommended her. I told her when I originally hired her I needed her to argue with me. She does… All the time! Excited to promote her. She will serve Ohio well," Yost wrote.Yost's clapback also met trolling as people commented that she is not "American-American". "Is she a Christian? That’s the biggest factor that concerns me. Based on the bindi on her forehead, I worry she is not," one wrote. "Another American job… given away to foreigners," another wrote. "She's Indian. They all have a loyalty first to other Indians. horrible pick. Totally un-American. the GOP is pathetic," a third user wrote."No one with the last name 'Sridharan' fought in the US Civil War. She's not an American," another wrote.Before joining the Ohio Solicitor’s Office, Mathura clerked for Judge Steven J. Menashi of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and Judge Deborah A. Batts of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. She holds a Juris Doctor from New York University School of Law, a Master’s Degree in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as a Bachelor’s Degree in Economics and in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Following Nikhil Ravishankar's appointment as Air New Zealand's CEO, media outlets in New Zealand disabled social media comments due to a surge of racist remarks targeting his Indian ethnicity.

News organizations like New Zealand Herald, Radio New Zealand, and 1News cited their inability to moderate the hateful content as the reason for shutting down comments.   After Indian-origin Nikhil Ravishankar was appointed as the new chief executive of Air New Zealand, the country's media said they had to disable comments on social media as there was a barrage of racist remarks targeting Ravishankar's ethnicity. Ravishankar was the chief digital officer of Air New Zealand before getting the major promotion which is the first for an Indian-origin person in the country.New Zealand Herald, Radio New Zealand, 1News said they had to disable comments as they can't allow hatred. The New Zealand Herald issued a statement in which it clarified that there were several racist comments owing to which they had to take the extreme step. "We appreciate the high level of interest in this story but cannot safely moderate it at this time," the news outlet said in a post in the comment thread."We want to foster a safe online community by reducing instances of hate, racism, abuse and misinformation. We welcome your feedback on articles but there has to be some parameters, and these are explained in our community house rules...We cannot tolerate hate. We cannot tolerate abuse towards individuals in our stories or other commenters," the company's social media policy says. Radio New Zealand had to do the same on the social media post on Ravishankar's appointment. "Under RNZ's comments policy, we will proactively disable comments on posts which may attract abusive or harmful comments or when resources are required elsewhere," a spokesperson for RNZ said. "In this instance, the comments were disabled after our monitoring found racist comments," the spokesperson said. "We want people to feel safe and respected on our community forums and will continue to proactively disable comments where necessary. We will not tolerate harmful communications."1News said it received a large number of comments on the post that announced Ravishankar's appointment and a vast majority were inappropriate. Who is Nikhil Ravishankar?Nikhil Ravishankar was born in India but brought up in New Zealand. He studied in New Zealand -- holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) from the University of Auckland. Before joining Air New Zealand, Ravishankar was Chief Digital Officer at Vector New Zealand (from 2017), and also worked as a Managing Director at Accenture across Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand, and in senior technology roles at Spark (formerly Telecom NZ).About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

After her TikTok video went viral, another ICE official offered help. Chatterjee highlights the broader issue of poor ICE communication, impacting immigrants facing detention and difficult bond policies, leading some to abandon their asylum claims. Trisha Chatterjee (Picture source: LinkedIn) Trisha Chatterjee, an Indian-origin immigration lawyer in Ohio, has alleged she was given the number of a Taco Bell outlet when she called ICE for urgent client support. Chatterjee posted about the incident on TikTok, where it went viral and ultimately led to help from another ICE official. But she says the larger issue lack of clear access to immigration authorities continues to cause serious harm to her clients."I called and they answered and they said, 'Hello, Taco Bell?' And I said, 'Taco Bell?' And the guy who was working said, 'Yeah, Taco Bell. Ma'am, you called me," Chatterjee recalled."I was in such disbelief," she said. "So, I called the ICE officer back, just really frustrated with what had just happened. He says, 'Oh, I'm sorry. I was trying to lighten the mood and make you laugh.'"ICE has denied the accusation. Homeland security called it a “lie and a smear.” Chatterjee stood by her version of events.Who is Trisha Chatterjee? Trisha Chatterjee is an Indian-origin immigration lawyer based in Greater Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio. She graduated from Miami University in 2020 and the University of Dayton School of Law in 2023.She works with the law office of Emily Feliz Garcia, a small immigration firm in Springdale. Before this, she worked at Abdallah law offices.For the last two years, she has handled immigration cases, especially those involving clients detained at the Butler County Jail in Ohio, which has a contract with ICE.Chatterjee was trying to submit "stay of removal" applications—urgent paperwork that can pause deportation for clients with pending immigration cases. ICE requires these to be submitted in person at the Detroit field office, but she hoped to file them locally in Blue Ash.After being unable to reach anyone by phone or email, she finally spoke to an ICE officer who gave her a phone number that turned out to be for Taco Bell. When she called back, the officer reportedly said he was trying to make her laugh.She posted a video about the incident on TikTok, which gained over 38,000 views. Many users sympathised, and one even helped her connect with a helpful ICE official in Blue Ash, who is now assisting her.Chatterjee said the larger problem is the lack of access and communication with ICE. She also highlighted how a stricter bond policy is making it harder for immigrants to stay out of detention during legal proceedings. Bonds can cost up to $50,000 and must be paid upfront.According to Chatterjee, some clients are abandoning their asylum cases or choosing to self-deport out of fear. She mentioned recent local arrests of people attending ICE check-ins, which has only deepened anxiety in immigrant communities.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The alleged abuse occurred in Contra Costa County, according to the district attorney’s office.Jennifer Powell, 45, has also been charged with 24 counts in a related felony complaint. Both Bhagwagar and Powell are being held at the Martinez detention facility. Bhagwagar’s bail has been set at $15 million.The charges in both cases carry possible prison terms of 15 years to life. Bhagwagar is expected to be arraigned Wednesday in Martinez, California.“Our office stands firmly committed to protecting children and holding those who cause harm accountable,” said Contra Costa county district attorney Diana Becton in a statement. “Every child deserves to feel safe, protected and heard when an injustice like this occurs.”According to the Contra Costa county sheriff’s office, detectives had been investigating Bhagwagar since April. His arrest was made with the assistance of Homeland Security Investigations after a warrant was issued.A short video published by aviation blog View From the Wing shows officers with badges exiting the plane’s cockpit.Delta Air Lines released a statement saying it was “appalled by reports of the charges related to the arrest” and confirmed that Bhagwagar had been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation. “Delta has zero tolerance for unlawful conduct,” the airline said.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani faces criticism for visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam due to his past support for defunding the police. Critics accuse Mamdani of shifting his stance for political gain, especially after his 2020 tweets resurfaced. Mamdani defends his actions, clarifying his current position on public safety and police funding. Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is facing backlash after visiting the family of fallen NYPD officer Didarul Islam, as critics pointed to his past 2020 tweet supporting "defund the police" stance.The controversy erupted after Mamdani, who recently returned from a trip to Uganda, visited the grieving family of officer Islam, one of four victims killed in a mass shooting in Midtown Manhattan. Zohran Mamdani’s SECRET Wedding Triggers Fury Amid Local Tragedy | WATCHThe shooter, Shane Tamura, opened fire on Monday, killing Islam and three others before shooting himself.Sharing a post on X, Mamdani wrote: “Two days ago, an act of senseless violence took the lives of Officer Didarul Islam, Wesley LePatner, Aland Etienne, and Julia Hyman. Today, I visited Officer Islam's family and learned of his legacy. I ask you to join me in honoring the memory of these four New Yorkers.”However, the post quickly drew criticism, with users referencing Mamdani’s previous tweets during the height of the “Defund the Police” movement in 2020.Many accused him of changing his stance for political gain. One user wrote, “You can't go from defund the police to never mind I love the police. You're asking New Yorkers to forgo their guns meanwhile you just had a wedding in Uganda with armed guards.”While another posted, “Zohran Mamdani exposed as a total fraud. Mocking cops, calling them racist, then acting like he cares? No loyalty to America. He belongs in Uganda, not leading NYC. Deport him and protect our city!”Earlier at a press conference following his visit to the officer’s home in The Bronx, Mamdani addressed the criticism and attempted to clarify his position saying: “I am not defunding the police; I am not running to defund the police.”“Over the course of this race, I’ve been very clear about my view of public safety and the critical role that the police have in creating that public safety,” he added.Standing alongside members of the Bangladeshi American Police Association—of which Officer Islam was a member—and labor union 32BJ, which represented another victim, Aland Etienne, Mamdani tried to strike a unifying tone.During the peak of the "Defund the Police" movement in 2020, Zohran Mamdani repeatedly called for major cuts to the NYPD budget. In one post, he wrote, “We don’t need an investigation to know that the NYPD is racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety. What we need is to #DefundTheNYPD.”In another, he said, “There is no negotiating with an institution this wicked & corrupt. Defund it. Dismantle it. End the cycle of violence,” referencing budget talks around proposed NYPD cuts.Now, Mamdani has distanced himself from those remarks. When asked about them, he responded, “My statements in 2020 were made amidst a frustration that many New Yorkers held at the murder of George Floyd.”Mamdani claimed that his current stance is more nuanced, stating that his previous posts were “clearly out of step” with his recent campaign platform. He now supports maintaining the NYPD headcount while reducing its overtime budget.Despite this clarification, skepticism remains. Many police officers and political observers have accused Mamdani of shifting positions purely for political gain in a city where public safety remains a top concern for voters, New York Post reported.Adding to the political firestorm, former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams, who are both trailing Mamdani in early polling for the 2025 mayoral race, weighed in shortly after the shooting. Mamdani fired back, accusing Cuomo of politicising the tragedy saying, “It is beyond me that politicians are looking to use these days to score such cynical political points, on the very day that I held the father of Officer Islam in my arms and he could not utter a single word.”“For the former governor to spend an entire day speaking almost exclusively about me and barely about the New Yorkers who have been killed is indicative of the very politics New Yorkers want to leave in the past,” he added.All three, Mamdani, Cuomo, and Adams are expected to attend officer Islam’s funeral on Thursday.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The high court found him guilty of rape and outrage of modesty, following incidents at his Jurong West shop in 2021. Despite his denials and claims of erectile dysfunction, the judge deemed the victim's testimony credible.  An Indian national was sentenced to more than 14 years in jail on Thursday by the Singapore high court for sexually assaulting a minor, reports the Straits Times.Ramalingam Selvasekaran was handed a sentence of 14 years, three months and two weeks after being found guilty of rape and two counts of outrage of modesty after assaulting an 11-year-old at his provision shop in Jurong West.According to the court, the assaults occurred between 4.50 pm and 5.05 pm on October 28, 2021. The girl had visited Ramalingam’s store and returned later to buy ice cream. Prosecutors said he led her into a back area and forced her to perform oral sex. After the incident, the girl sought help from a passerby, who called the police.Ramalingam represented himself during the trial, which began on January 16. He was convicted on all charges on 7 July.“The fact that she had not run off after the first act of molest, or that she did not resist the assaults, or inform her grandfather, were all to my mind sufficiently explained, particularly given that she was still young and immature,” said Justice Aidan Xu, who found the girl’s account credible and consistent.Ramalingam’s earlier statements to police reportedly included admissions of hugging, kissing, and oral sex. However, he later denied any wrongdoing, claiming he was suffering from erectile dysfunction and that no DNA evidence was found on the victim.The judge ruled that these claims did not undermine the girl’s testimony. “While there was no dispute that Ramalingam suffered from erectile dysfunction, the prosecution’s expert witness gave a cogent explanation that oral rape remained possible,” Justice Xu was quoted as saying to Straits Times.Following sentencing on July 30, Ramalingam said he would appeal and was granted bail of S$80,000. He attempted to negotiate with the judge over the conditions, asking for the removal of his electronic tag and exemption from reporting to the Police Cantonment Complex. Both requests were denied.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The incidents, condemned by authorities and community leaders, are being treated as linked. This follows a separate racist assault in Adelaide, where an Indian man was brutally attacked after being told to "f--- off, Indian."  A Hindu temple in Melbourne’s eastern suburb of Boronia was defaced with racist graffiti this week prompting widespread condemnation and police investigation.As reported by The Brisbane Times and The Sydney Morning Herald, offensive red graffiti with the words “Go home” and other racial slurs were found daubed across the Shree Swaminarayan Temple on Wadhurst Drive, as well as two nearby Asian-operated restaurants Kingsland Chinese Restaurant and Charles King Dumpling.Police said a healing centre on Mountain Highway was also defaced the same night, bringing the total number of sites attacked to four. “There is absolutely no place at all in our society for hate-based and racist behaviour,” Victoria Police said in a statement. Authorities confirmed that all four incidents are being treated as linked and that an investigation is under way.PollShould harsher penalties be implemented for hate crimes?Yes, definitelyNo, current laws are sufficient'An attack on our right to worship'Makrand Bhagwat, President of the Hindu Council of Australia’s Victoria chapter, told Australia Today the vandalism of the temple was “heartbreaking” for the community. “Our temple is meant to be a sanctuary of peace, devotion and unity,” he said. “To have it targeted in this way feels like an attack on our identity, our right to worship and freedom of religion.”Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan sent a personal message of support to temple management. “What happened this week was hateful, racist and deeply disturbing,” she wrote. “It wasn’t just vandalism – it was a deliberate act of hate, designed to intimidate, isolate, and spread fear.”Local interfaith networks, including the City of Greater Knox’s Multifaith Network, have expressed support. “We want to show that love and solidarity triumph over hate,” said community leader Vikrant Thakur.Indian man targeted in racist attackThis came after a 23-year-old Indian man, Charanpreet Singh, was brutally attacked and left unconscious on a street in Adelaide following a reported racist assault linked to a parking dispute. According to 9News, the men allegedly told Singh to "f--- off, Indian" before launching a violent, unprovoked assault.“They just said ‘f--- off, Indian’, and after that they just started punching,” Singh said. “I tried to fight back, but they beat me until I was unconscious.”He sustained serious injuries, including brain trauma and facial fractures. A 20-year-old from Enfield was arrested and charged, but others involved remain at large.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Singh and his wife were allegedly ambushed by a group of men who shouted racial slurs before inflicting serious injuries. The incident has sparked outrage and renewed calls for enhanced safety measures for international students in the area.  An Indian international student has been hospitalised with serious injuries after a violent assault in Australia's Adelaide that is being investigated as a possible racially motivated attack. The incident has sparked outrage across the Indian community and renewed calls for better safety measures for international students.Charanpreet Singh, 23, was with his wife near Kintore Avenue on Saturday evening (July 19) when they were allegedly ambushed by a group of five men. According to Australia Today, the couple had just parked their car to view the city’s light displays around 9:22pm when the attackers emerged from another vehicle.Viral video shows assaultEyewitnesses and video footage shared on social media reportedly show the men striking Singh with what appeared to be metal knuckles or sharp objects, while shouting racial abuse including: “F--- off, Indian”. The attackers then fled the scene, leaving Singh unconscious and seriously injured on the road.PollWhat should be prioritized to improve safety for international students?Awareness campaigns and community supportStronger law enforcement and quicker actionSingh, who spoke to 9News from his hospital bed, said the altercation began over a car parking dispute but escalated into a racially charged assault. “They just said, ‘F--- off, Indian,’ and after that they just started punching,” he recalled. “You can change anything in your body, but you can’t change the colours.”He sustained facial fractures and brain trauma, and was taken by emergency services to the Royal Adelaide Hospital for overnight treatment. The assault has left members of the local Indian community shaken, with many expressing solidarity with Singh online.“When things like this happen, it makes you feel like you should go back,” Singh said.Police investigation under waySouth Australia Police confirmed they were called to Kintore Avenue shortly before 9.30pm and found Singh with facial injuries. “He was taken to hospital for treatment. Investigations are continuing,” a police spokesperson told The Indian Sun. One man, a 20-year-old from Enfield, has been arrested and charged with assault causing harm. The other suspects remain at large.Authorities are reviewing CCTV footage from the area and have urged witnesses to come forward. “We ask anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers,” the police said.Premier Peter Malinauskas has condemned the incident, calling it “completely unwelcome in our state”. He added, “Any time we see any evidence of any racial attack, it is just not consistent with where the majority of our community are at.”Another attack in DublinThis follows another attack targeting an Indian individual. An Indian man in his 40s was hospitalised after being brutally attacked by a group of teenage boys in a violent, racist assault in Dublin on Saturday evening. The gang falsely accused him of inappropriate behaviour with children before beating him and pulling down his trousers. “Gardaí in Tallaght were alerted to an incident at Parkhill Road... Investigations are ongoing,” police said. Councillor Baby Pereppadan said, “He couldn’t speak much because of the shock.” Sinn Féin’s Seán Crowe added, “You are sowing hate, fear, and division.” A protest is planned for July 26 to condemn rising racist violence in Ireland.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Her exit, surprising to many, opens an opportunity for the U.S. Treasury to propose a successor amidst global trade dynamic shifts. Gopinath, the first female chief economist, joined the IMF in 2019 and was promoted in 2022. Gita Gopinath (File photo) NEW DELHI: Gita Gopinath, the second-in-command at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), will step down at the end of August to return to her position at Harvard University, the IMF announced on Monday.The timing of Gita Gopinath’s exit has taken many within the IMF by surprise and is believed to have been prompted by her own decision, reported news agency Reuters. Having originally left Harvard to serve at the Fund, she is now set to resume her role as professor of economics at the university. Her departure opens a window for the US Treasury to propose a successor—an opportunity that comes as President Donald Trump pushes to reshape global trade dynamics and curb the country’s persistent trade deficits through sweeping tariffs on imports worldwide. Gopinath, who joined the IMF in 2019 as its first-ever female chief economist, was elevated to First Deputy Managing Director in January 2022. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva will appoint her successor “in due course,” the statement added.Gopinath had served as the first female chief economist of the Washington-based global lender for three years. Gopinath's research has been published in many top economics journals.

Harris courts Republicans with events on abortion rights, border security, and small business creation, while Trump takes stances that upset some conservatives. Both aim to expand their coalitions before the election. Kamala Harris trolled for 'fake accent'Kamala Harris trolled for 'fake accent' Kamala Harris trolled for 'fake accent'Kamala Harris trolled for 'fake accent' Kamala Harris trolled for 'fake accent'1234 In a surprising turn of events, US presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are blurring party lines as they vie for votes in the final stretch of a highly competitive election.Harris has been actively courting Republican voters, hosting events focused on issues such as abortion rights, border security, and small business creation, which have featured Republican officials.The Democratic National Convention even granted speaking slots to seven Republicans last month, and outside groups are spending millions to help Harris connect with disaffected opposing party members.Simultaneously, Harris has adopted a more assertive foreign policy stance, pledging to include a Republican in her Cabinet if elected and openly discussing her gun ownership."If somebody breaks in my house they're getting shot. Sorry," Harris told Oprah Winfrey, surprising the television star with her candour. Harris' strong support for US leadership on the global stage has already earned her the backing of more than 100 Republican national security and foreign policy officials who previously served under various presidents, including Dick Cheney.Trump, on the other hand, has taken positions that have irked some conservatives. He recently called for a federal cap on credit card interest rates at 10%. He expressed support for a federal law mandating insurance companies to cover in vitro fertilization (IVF), despite opposition from social conservatives who believe embryos used in the process should be protected.Barbara Comstock, a former Republican congresswoman from Virginia who co-chaired Nikki Haley's GOP presidential campaign, now supports Harris, citing her call for an expanded child care tax credit, support for a tough bipartisan immigration bill, and a foreign policy stance in contrast to Trump's admiration for leaders like Vladimir Putin.Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii and now a top Trump ally, describes Trump's policy approach as "common sense," highlighting his support for criminal justice reform and a foreign policy philosophy that seeks to avoid US involvement in global conflicts like the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Despite the candidates' embrace of policies that appeal to the other side, their priorities still largely align with their party's traditions.Trump opposes abortion rights and plans to vote to uphold a Florida law banning abortions after six weeks, while Harris supports abortion rights as protected under Roe v. Wade, backs a ban on assault weapons, and wants to extend prescription drug cost caps to all Americans.As the election draws near, both candidates are working to expand their coalitions. Trump's spokesman, Brian Hughes, argues that the GOP nominee has appeal among African Americans, Hispanics, and labour union members, citing the Teamsters Union's decision not to endorse either candidate as a significant win for Trump.Meanwhile, Harris, who has only been in the presidential race for eight weeks, is beginning to articulate specific policy plans that favour liberal policies in most cases, such as combating climate change, supporting labour unions, and pushing for voting rights legislation to combat racial discrimination.

(AP) WASHINGTON: The United States said Thursday that Russia is on the verge of unleashing a massive military attack against Ukraine, dismissing Moscow's claim to be pulling forces back, as artillery fire hit a Ukrainian kindergarten.In a dramatic, previously unscheduled speech to the United Nations in New York, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said intelligence showed Moscow could order an assault on its neighbor in the "coming days."With US and other Western governments saying they see no evidence of Russia's claim to be withdrawing, Blinken challenged the Kremlin to "announce today with no qualification, equivocation or deflection that Russia will not invade Ukraine.""Demonstrate it by sending your troops, your tanks, your planes, back to their barracks and hangers," he said.Russia denies any invasion plans but warned of "military-technical measures" if its far-reaching demands for a US and NATO pullback from eastern Europe aren't satisfied.The United States said late Thursday that Blinken and his Moscow counterpart Sergei Lavrov had agreed to meet next week -- provided there was no invasion before then.Keeping up the pressure, President Joe Biden accused Moscow of preparing a "false flag operation" as a pretext for an attack."They have not moved any of their troops out. They've moved more troops in," Biden said. "Every indication we have is that they're prepared to go into Ukraine."He added, however, that diplomacy is not dead. "There is a path. There is a way through this," he said.Biden will hold a phone meeting Friday with the leaders of Germany, Britain, France, the European Union and NATO to discuss the Ukraine crisis.Russia has massed enormous air, land and sea forces around Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin and officials say the troops are only conducting practice exercises.However, Putin has made clear that the price for removing any threat would be Ukraine agreeing never to join NATO and for the Western alliance to pull back from a swath of eastern Europe, effectively splitting the continent into Cold War-style spheres of influence.The United States said that it had received Putin's response to its offers of a diplomatic solution to the crisis, but did not give any reaction to the contents.The Russian foreign ministry indicated that there was little to discuss."In the absence of will on the American side to negotiate firm and legally binding guarantees on our security from the United States and its allies, Russia will be forced to respond, including with military-technical measures," the foreign ministry said."We insist on the withdrawal of all US armed forces in Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Baltics."Russia also expelled the number two US diplomat in Moscow, the US State Department said, condemning the "unprovoked" action.Russia took over Ukraine's Crimea region and began backing heavily armed separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Lugansk regions in 2014, sparking a war that has already cost thousands of lives.Sporadic fighting remains common in the east, and the Ukrainian army accused the pro-Russian separatists of 34 ceasefire breaches on Thursday, 28 of them using heavy weapons.The potentially most serious incident -- an example of the kind of spark that many fear could ignite far more intense fighting -- was the shelling of a kindergarten in the village of Stanytsia-Luganska. Children were inside but none were hit.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted that the attack "by pro-Russian forces is a big provocation."Russian news agencies quoted authorities in the separatist Lugansk region saying they blamed Kyiv after the situation on the frontline "escalated significantly."Western capitals say they are also concerned by the Russian parliament's request that Putin grant unilateral recognition of independence for the separatists in eastern Ukraine."If this request were accepted, it would... demonstrate a Russian decision to choose a path of confrontation over dialogue," British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said.Putin earlier this week claimed with no evidence that Ukraine is committing "genocide" in the eastern region.Moscow has made several announcements of troop withdrawals this week and on Thursday said that tank units had begun returning to their bases from near Ukraine.The United States, NATO and Ukraine all said they had seen no evidence of a pullback, with Washington saying Russia had in fact moved 7,000 more troops near the border.According to US officials, there are now about 150,000 Russian troops arrayed in offensive groupings on the southern, eastern and northern borders of Ukraine.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  5 signs of a master manipulator, as per psychology5 traditional Indian hair oils for hair growthBigg Boss Kannada 11: Full and final list of contestantsFrom Golla getting his first seat on the flight to missing the last cable car in Interlaken; A look at Bharti Singh and Haarsh Limbachiyaa's first Europe Trip with their little munchkin5 sneakers you should stay away from; a Nike shoe is also on the list!5 body language tips to appear more confidentTop 5 Indian states with the highest per capita incomeWeekly Horoscope: September 30th to October 6th, 20247 vegetables that reduce belly fat quickly5 psychology tricks to make people magically like you123Hot PicksTirupati Laddu Case Hearing LiveDaylight Savings 2024Erika Carr UtahPakistan Job CutsNepal FloodsAir Canada FinedStock Market TodayTOP TRENDINGRafale Marine Flight JetsHarvard Application ProcessWho is Parita ParekhPaul HeymanDelhi Dwarka ExpresswayWWE Royal RumbleBad Blood 2024Carlos AlcarazMohammed SirajBrain Exercises to Boost MemoryTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website9 Timeless Skills That Will Always Be in Demand7 Effective Ways for Professionals to Enhance Productivity and Cultivate Inner Peace12 Effective Ways to Improve Handwriting for ExamsStock market crash today: BSE Sensex plunges over 1,200 points; Nifty50 ends below 25,850 - top reasons markets have tankedTNA Star Eric Young shared his thoughts on the docuseries about WWE’s former chairmanWho is Parita Parekh, youngest Indian entrepreneur and a Stanford alumnaSeventeen KIIT Athletics Who Participated in Paris Olympics & Paralympics Felicitated By Varsity'Team India ka Ghajini kaun hai?' - Rohit Sharma answers10 Common Habits That Could Be Hindering Your SuccessJ&K police head constable Bashir Ahmed killed after gunning down terrorist in Kathua encounterAs Biden calls for ceasefire, Israel tells US it will launch ground offensive in Lebanon soonHigh stakes in J&K polls phase 3: 415 candidates vie for 40 constituenciesKashmir’s ‘X factor’: Is he only a vote cutter or is he the real deal?'Fanatic theocrats leading you to abyss': Netanyahu warns IraniansMuda case: K'taka CM's wife offers to surrender 14 plotsSA20 Auction: Players, squads, date - everything you need to knowExplained: Silicon-carbon batteries have arrived in phones.

And scientists say the exceptionally hot year is part of a long-term warming trend that shows hints of accelerating. Two U.S. science agencies - NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - and a private measuring group released their calculations for last year's global temperature on Thursday, and all said it wasn't far behind ultra-hot 2016 and 2020. Six different calculations found 2021 was between the fifth and seventh hottest year since the late 1800s. NASA said 2021 tied with 2018 for sixth warmest, while NOAA puts last year in sixth place by itself, ahead of 2018. Scientists say a La Nina - natural cooling of parts of the central Pacific that changes weather patterns globally and brings chilly deep ocean water to the surface - dampened global temperatures just as its flip side, El Nino, boosted them in 2016.  Still, they said 2021 was the hottest La Nina year on record and that the year did not represent a cooling off of human-caused climate change but provided more of the same heat. "So it's not quite as headline-dominating as being the warmest on record, but give it another few years and we'll see another one of those" records, said climate scientist Zeke Hausfather of the Berkeley Earth monitoring group that also ranked 2021 the sixth hottest. "It's the long-term trend, and it's an indomitable march upward." Gavin Schmidt, the climate scientist who heads NASA's temperature team, said "the long-term trend is very, very clear. And it's because of us. And it's not going to go away until we stop increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere." The last eight years have been the eight hottest on record, NASA and NOAA data agree. Global temperatures, averaged over a 10-year period to take out natural variability, are nearly 2 degrees (1.1 degrees Celsius) warmer than 140 years ago, their data shows.  The other 2021 measurements came from the Japanese Meteorological Agency and satellite measurements by Copernicus Climate Change Service i n Europe and the University of Alabama in Huntsville. There was such a distinctive jump in temperatures about eight to 10 years ago that scientists have started looking at whether the rise in temperatures is speeding up. Both Schmidt and Hausfather said early signs point to that but it's hard to know for sure. "I think you can see the acceleration, but whether it's statistically robust is not quite clear," Schmidt said in an interview. "If you just look at the last the last 10 years, how many of them are way above the trend line from the previous 10 years? Almost all of them." The global average temperature last year was 58.5 degrees (14.7 Celsius), according to NOAA. In 1988, NASA's then-chief climate scientist James Hansen grabbed headlines when he testified to Congress about global warming in a year that was the hottest on record at the time. Now, the 57.7 degrees (14.3 Celsius) of 1988 ranks as the 28th hottest year on record.  Last year, 1.8 billion people in 25 Asian, African and Middle Eastern nations had their hottest years on record, including China, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Iran, Myanmar and South Korea, according to Berkeley Earth. The deep ocean, where most heat is stored in the seas, also set a record for warmth in 2021, according to a separate new study. "Ocean warming, aside from causing coral bleaching and threatening sea life and fish populations we rely upon for roughly 25% of our protein intake globally, is destabilizing Antarctic ice shelves and threatens massive ... sea level rise if we don't act," said study co-author Michael Mann, a Pennsylvania State University climate scientist. The last time Earth had a cooler than normal year by NOAA or NASA calculations was 1976. That means 69% of the people on the planet - more than 5 billion people under age 45 - have never experienced such a year, based on United Nations data. North Carolina state climatologist Kathie Dello, 39, who wasn't part of the new reports but said they make sense, said, "I've only lived in a warming world and I wish that the younger generations did not have to say the same. It didn't have to be this way."End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  Bigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial show5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the world​Bigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8​Bigg Boss 18: From Shehzada Dhami making serious allegations against Rajan Shahi to Alice Kaushik opening up about her parents’ demise: Major highlights from the show5 types of people one should completely avoid for peace in life, as per psychology10 most powerful countries in the world in 20245 minimalist habits to stop wasting your time​10 most educated countries of the world​From Aamir Khan's warm surprise with son Junaid to a musical tribute; A look at Amitabh Bachchan's 82nd Birthday celebration on the sets of Kaun Banega Crorepati 167 vegetables that reduce belly fat quicklyHow tall are Trump family membersTGIKS 2: From impersonating legendary cricketer MS Dhoni to revealing secrets from the World Cup: Top moments featuring Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and others123Hot PicksAssembly Election Result 2024 DateIsrael Hezbollah War Live2024 Nobel Prize in MedicineHaryana Assembly Constituencies 2024AIIMS Doctors Candle MarchPakistan Airport ExplosionChennai Air Show ChaosTOP TRENDINGElection Result Date and TimeKayla NicoleBasit AliWorld Richest FamilyThe San Francisco 49ersIsrael MossadRRB JE Exam DatePresident MuizzuJimmy UsosSadhguru QuotesTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteElection Results 2024 Live: Stage set in J&K, Haryana for first major BJP vs Congress showdown since Lok Sabha pollsTravis Kelce's Ex Kayla Nicole Delivers a Powerful 'Mental Health' Message While Facing Backlash from Taylor Swift Fans"Travis Kelce's career is over": Travis Kelce’s time in Kansas City may be numbered as the Chiefs decided to re-sign one of their familiar faces9 Powerful Quotes to Motivate Students Towards Success Through Hard WorkTop 10 Largest Economies In The World 2025: India To Become 4th Largest Economy Soon!

Israel on Thursday approved a fourth dose of vaccine for people with weakened immune systems, and Britain’s National Health Service said its hospitals would erect field wards to help deal with the surge in coronavirus cases.Several US states hit their all-time case records for coronavirus cases this week, disrupting the lives of millions of Americans. New York Mayor-elect Eric Adams vowed to keep the city’s vaccine mandate for private-sector employees in place, and the CDC issued a blunt warning to potential travelers: “Avoid cruise travel regardless of vaccination status.”Health officials are trying to encourage more Americans to get a booster shot — just over one-third of fully vaccinated adults have received one — and warn that the unvaccinated face the greatest risk of severe illness and death from omicron.“Our CDC guidance has been very clear that people should get their boost when they are eligible,” Dr. Rochelle PWalensky, the CDC director, told reporters this week. “That is both for — because of waning immunity and because we need more protection against Omicron.”Walensky said Wednesday that even as daily case counts had climbed by roughly 60% in the past week, hospitalizations and deaths were still relatively low, a suggestion that omicron might be less lethal. She and Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, cited international research hinting at the same conclusion.Studies have shown that while two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine have provided strong protection as the delta variant swarmed the country, omicron can evade the defenses of fully vaccinated people, heightening fears about the risks for young people.More than 70% of people 12 and older in the United States are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. Around one-quarter of children between 5 and 11 have received at least one dose. Children under 5 are still not eligible for a vaccine.The latest surge has caused a concerning rise in hospitalizations among children. But early data suggests that omicron appears to be causing milder illness for children, similar to findings for adults. And hospital officials and physicians have said that nearly all children hospitalized with Covid-19 were unvaccinated or partially vaccinated.Children can better withstand coronavirus infections but in rare instances can still become very sick and even die. At least 1.8 million adolescents between 12 and 15 years old have tested positive for the virus, according to the CDC.A series of studies published Thursday by the agency underscored how important vaccination can be for children and adolescents. In one study spanning July through early December that examined hundreds of adolescents in Arizona, researchers said two doses of the vaccine reduced the risk of infection by 92%.Two other CDC studies showed that there were few serious side effects reported among 5- to 11-year-olds who had received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and that pediatric hospitalizations occurred mostly among children who had not been fully vaccinated.A recent South African study showed that the effectiveness of Pfizer’s vaccine against severe illness and hospitalization was about 70% after two doses, against omicron in particular.Of the three federally authorized coronavirus shots, Pfizer-BioNTech's is the only vaccine approved for use in people under 18.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory committee is planning to meet by the middle of next week to weigh in on whether to recommend the changes in the FDA’s booster policy. If the committee agrees with the FDA’s authorizations, Walensky is expected to promptly endorse the revisions.Dr. Kathryn M. Edwards, a vaccine expert and professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said the FDA’s expected decision was justified.“We’re having a lot of suggestions and a lot of experience with omicron that it’s infecting people that have been boosted. But fortunately, we’re not seeing a lot of severe disease,” she said. “So I think if you look at the immune responses, at least in adults, you’ll see that this booster dose does enhance your neutralization capacity against omicron.”Other vaccine experts said the administration’s continued attention to offering boosters to younger, healthier people was misguided.Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, said research on vaccine effectiveness, including against omicron, had revealed that two doses offer substantial and durable protection against severe disease, including in adolescents — the purpose of vaccination, he said.A booster dose could increase a person's protection for several months, he said, but delivering extra shots to young Americans was “focusing on the people who are already protected.”The Biden administration, he added, should instead direct more attention to reaching the unvaccinated, a point he said was backed up by the overwhelming majority of hospitalized children he had seen in Philadelphia being unvaccinated.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the worldBigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial show​Bigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8​10 most powerful countries in the world in 20247 vegetables that reduce belly fat quickly​10 most educated countries of the world​How tall are Trump family membersTGIKS 2: From impersonating legendary cricketer MS Dhoni to revealing secrets from the World Cup: Top moments featuring Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and othersWhere the zodiac signs would prefer to liveFrom Bharti Singh- Elvish Yadav getting summoned in Rs 500 crore fraud case to Khushi Mali replacing Palak Sindhwani in Taarak Mehta: Top TV newsSunny Deol's 'Gadar', Shah Rukh Khan's 'Devdas', Rishi Kapoor's 'Chandni': Movies allegedly rejected by GovindaOptical illusion psychology test: The first thing you see reveals the hidden flaw affecting your relationships123Hot PicksIsrael Hezbollah War LiveBhopal Factory Drug SeizeGang Attack in HaitiAIIMS Doctors Candle MarchPakistan Airport ExplosionChennai Air Show ChaosHurricane Milton EvacuationTOP TRENDINGKarachi Airport BlastKayla NicoleWorld Richest FamilyThe San Francisco 49ersIsrael MossadPrince WilliamPresident MuizzuChinese Spy BallonsRishabh PantSadhguru QuotesTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website"Travis Kelce's career is over": Travis Kelce’s time in Kansas City may be numbered as the Chiefs decided to re-sign one of their familiar facesTravis Kelce's Ex Kayla Nicole Delivers a Powerful 'Mental Health' Message While Facing Backlash from Taylor Swift Fans'Diddy List': Names of celebrities connected to Sean Combs viral3 dead in Chennai after Indian Air Force air showFour spectators dead after Chennai air showPresident Muizzu in India: 'Will never hurt India's security interests, Maldives first but will prioritise ties with India'1 dead, 10 injured in massive explosion near Karachi airportIAF quietly shooting down 'Chinese spy balloons' at high altitudes'Wouldn't have given birth': Gaza mother struggles to provide for newborns amid conflictRishabh Pant's Masterclass: How India conquered the fortress GabbaMiracle at 17,000 ft: How two US & UK climbers were rescued from HimalayasRahul's heartfelt cooking session with Dalit man, his family;

Lance Lowry (Agency photo) NEW YORK: At a Georgia state House of Representatives hearing on prison conditions in September, a corrections officer called in to testify, interrupting his shift to tell lawmakers how dire conditions had become. On a "good day," he told lawmakers, he had maybe six or seven officers to supervise roughly 1,200 people. He said he had recently been assigned to look after 400 prisoners by himself.There weren't enough nurses to provide medical care. "All the officers ... absolutely despise working there," said the officer, who didn't give his name for fear of retaliation. In Texas, Lance Lowry quit after 20 years as a corrections officer to become a long-haul trucker because he couldn't bear the job any longer. Watching friends and coworkers die from COVID-19, along with dwindling support from his superiors, wore on him. "I would have liked to stay till I was 50," said Lowry, 48. "But the pandemic changed that." Staff shortages have long been a challenge for prison agencies, given the low pay and grueling nature of the work. But the coronavirus pandemic - and its impact on the labor market - has pushed many corrections systems into crisis. Officers are retiring and quitting in droves, while officials struggle to recruit new employees. And some prisons whose populations dropped during the pandemic have seen their numbers rise again, exacerbating the problem. There is no one thing pushing prison employees out in high numbers now. Some are leaving for new opportunities as more places are hiring. University of Michigan economist Betsey Stevenson pointed to the increased risk of COVID-19 for people working in prisons. "When jobs become riskier, it becomes harder to attract workers," she wrote in an email. "By failing to protect prisoners from COVID, the criminal justice system not only created an unfair risk of severe illness and death for the incarcerated, but the increased COVID risk to employees has undoubtedly contributed to staffing shortages." Unions representing prison officers in states including Massachusetts and California and at the federal level also claim vaccine mandates will drive out unvaccinated employees and exacerbate understaffing, though it's unclear how big of an impact those rules will have. "There are dozens of reasons to leave and very few to stay," said Brian Dawe, national director of One Voice United, a nonprofit supporting corrections officers. "Understaffing, poor pay, poor benefits, horrendous working conditions. Officers and their families in many jurisdictions have had enough." Employers from construction companies to restaurants are having difficulty hiring and keeping people. Nearly 3% of American workers, 4.3 million, quit their jobs in August, according to new data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the stakes are higher in prisons, where having fewer guards means significantly more dangerous conditions for incarcerated people. And for the officers left behind, worsening shortages have made an already difficult job unbearable, many say. In Georgia, some prisons report up to 70% vacancy rates. In Nebraska, overtime hours have quadrupled since 2010, as fewer officers are forced to work longer hours. Florida has temporarily closed three prisons out of more than 140 because of understaffing, and vacancy rates have nearly doubled there in the last year. And at federal prisons across the country, guards are picketing in front of their facilities over understaffing, while everyone from prison teachers to dentists is pulled in to cover security shifts. In recent weeks, reporters from The Marshall Project and The Associated Press have spoken with workers, officials, attorneys and people incarcerated in more than a dozen prison systems to understand the consequences of the staffing shortfalls. The federal Bureau of Prisons says about 93% of its front-line guard positions are filled, with little more than 1,000 vacancies, though workers in many prisons say they're feeling the pinch as others are conscripted to fill in for missing officers. Asked last week in a U.S. Senate hearing about federal prison staffing, Attorney General Merrick Garland said, "I agree this is a serious problem at the Bureau of Prisons." Garland told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco was working with the bureau to address staffing issues. Inside prisons, growing shortages mean a rise in lockdowns. Restrictions that might have begun as a way to stop the spread of COVID-19 have continued because there aren't enough guards to supervise activities. Some incarcerated people say they can't take classes, participate in group therapy sessions or even work out in the recreation yard or take a shower. That can force those in general population into de facto solitary confinement, and those already in segregation into near-total lockdown. "If we get rec once a week, that's a good week," said Anthony Haynes, who is on Texas' death row in a unit that is barely half-staffed. "We don't always get showers." A spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice did not respond to Haynes' claims but acknowledged that staffing is a challenge in Texas' prisons. "Before COVID-19, staffing was frequently impacted by economic surges and competing employment opportunities," said spokesman Robert Hurst in an email. "The pandemic has exacerbated these issues. We also recognize that the job of the correctional officer is one of the most difficult in all of state government." He added that Texas has closed six of its more than 100 facilities in the last year due to staffing problems. Kansas has cut job training and reduced supervision for people after they're released. Two-thirds of the men in Nebraska's prisons can't see visitors on the weekends - when most families are free to travel - because of understaffing. Dr. Homer Venters, a former chief medical officer for the jail system in New York City, inspects conditions in prisons around the country for court cases. Understaffing will lead to an increase in preventable prison deaths, he said, as the quality of care reaches new lows. "Things are much worse behind bars now than they have been for a long time," Venters said. "There are so many staff that have left. That means that basic clinical services, like getting to scheduled appointments, just isn't happening the way it was even five years ago."End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  Bigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial showSchengen visa denials: 5 countries with the highest rejection ratesSanjay Dutt-Manyata to Hardik Pandya-Natasa Stankovic: Bollywood couples who renewed their wedding vows5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the world8 animals that help Earth heal and how5 psychology tips to be more mature in life and relationships10 most powerful countries in the world in 2024From getting kicked out from Shark Tank India 4 to marrying a Mexico-based model, buying India’s first : Times when Deepinder Goyal made headlines​Bigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8​123Hot PicksUS Election Timeline 2024World's Fastest JetsDelhi Drugs in NamkeenHarris vs Trump Latest PollsUP Scholarships Non-Creamy LayerMahadev Betting AppStock market todayTOP TRENDINGRic FlairNavi Mumbai AirportPrince HarryNFL Week SeasonActor NithinIPL FranchisesAyudha Puja DateRatan TataKali Crown BangladeshDiddy ListTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website“When you know, you know”: Russell Wilson’s Wife Ciara Revealed That She Knew Wilson Was The One After Their First DateTollywood actor Nithin arrested for snatching gold chain in HyderabadRatan Tata’s successor: Noel Tata appointed chairman of Tata TrustsDiwali 2024 Date: When is Deepawali?

(Agency photo) NEW YORK: US President Thomas Jefferson's statue, a presence for more than a century in the New York City Council chamber, is coming down following a public commission reassessment of the legacy of the founding father who was also a slaveholder. The New York City Public Design Commission voted unanimously on Monday to dismantle the 7-foot (2.13-meter) bronze likeness of Jefferson, which has watched over proceedings in the most populous U.S.city since 1915. The commission agreed to lend the 187-year-old statue long-term to the New-York Historical Society. It is a plaster model of a statue still on display in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. "Jefferson embodied some of the most shameful parts of our country's long and nuanced history," Councilperson Adrienne Adams, co-chair of the council's Black, Latino and Asian Caucus, told the commission. "It is time for the city to turn the page and move forward." Similar monuments have become a target of anti-racism protests in recent years. Statues of Civil War Confederate leaders have also been dismantled.Jefferson's place in U.S. history is complex. Having written that "all men are created equal" as the primary author of the Declaration of Independence, he also enslaved more than 600 people and fathered at least six children with Sally Hemings, a woman he enslaved. Not everyone supported the removal of the statue. Sean Wilentz, a American history professor at Princeton University, wrote in a letter read to the commission: "The statue specifically honors Jefferson for his greatest contribution to America, indeed, to humankind."

(Getty Images)  WASHINGTON: Pakistan and its intelligence service have played a key role in fostering the Taliban and allowing it to eventually take over Afghanistan, a top Republican lawmaker has alleged, stating that it is disgusting to watch Islamabad celebrate the group's victory that will bring "untold brutality" to Afghans.Congressman Steve Chabot, Co-Chair of the India Caucus, said in his address to the virtual gala of Hindu Political Action Committee on Sunday that he applauds the Indian government for welcoming the Afghan religious minorities who have a good reason to fear persecution at the hands of the Taliban and their evil rule.“In contrast, we all know that Pakistan and particularly its intelligence services played a key role fostering the Taliban and allowing them to eventually take over. It's just disgusting to watch Pakistani officials celebrate the victory of this group that will bring untold brutality to the Afghan people,” Chabot said.“Pakistan's own persecution of religious minorities, however, gets a lot less attention here in America than it deserves. We would do well to educate our fellow citizens about these abuses. Persecution is particularly manifests in the heinous practice of the kidnapping, force conversion to Islam and forced marriage of underage Hindu girls to older Muslim men,” he said.Such allegations are not mere hearsay, he noted.Major news organisations and human rights groups have documented the practice with so many heartbreaking stories of girls in their early teens taken from their families, and traffic into forced marriages. These abuses are often just ignored, said the Congressman.In his address, Chabot said that with roughly 6 million Hindus in America, Hindus are unquestionably an integral part of society throughout the United States.“Through strong work ethic and high educational attainment, Hindus exemplify the American dream. These virtues also allow Hindus to take on key roles in communities across the country, and also give back to those communities in so many ways,” he said.That is why the reports of a rise in discrimination against Hindu Americans around the country are so concerning, he rued, adding that there is no place in America for such discrimination.“We must all seek ways to bring it to an end,” Chabot added.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  Bigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial show5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the world​Bigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8​Bigg Boss 18: From Shehzada Dhami making serious allegations against Rajan Shahi to Alice Kaushik opening up about her parents’ demise: Major highlights from the show5 types of people one should completely avoid for peace in life, as per psychology10 most powerful countries in the world in 20245 minimalist habits to stop wasting your time​10 most educated countries of the world​From Aamir Khan's warm surprise with son Junaid to a musical tribute; A look at Amitabh Bachchan's 82nd Birthday celebration on the sets of Kaun Banega Crorepati 167 vegetables that reduce belly fat quicklyHow tall are Trump family membersTGIKS 2: From impersonating legendary cricketer MS Dhoni to revealing secrets from the World Cup: Top moments featuring Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and others123Hot PicksAssembly Election Result 2024 DateIsrael Hezbollah War Live2024 Nobel Prize in MedicineHaryana Assembly Constituencies 2024AIIMS Doctors Candle MarchPakistan Airport ExplosionChennai Air Show ChaosTOP TRENDINGElection Result Date and TimeKayla NicoleBasit AliWorld Richest FamilyThe San Francisco 49ersIsrael MossadRRB JE Exam DatePresident MuizzuJimmy UsosSadhguru QuotesTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteElection Results 2024 Live: Stage set in J&K, Haryana for first major BJP vs Congress showdown since Lok Sabha pollsTravis Kelce's Ex Kayla Nicole Delivers a Powerful 'Mental Health' Message While Facing Backlash from Taylor Swift Fans"Travis Kelce's career is over": Travis Kelce’s time in Kansas City may be numbered as the Chiefs decided to re-sign one of their familiar faces9 Powerful Quotes to Motivate Students Towards Success Through Hard WorkTop 10 Largest Economies In The World 2025: India To Become 4th Largest Economy Soon!

(Reuters Photo) WASHINGTON: Democrats face a test of unity in the US House of Representatives on Monday as they begin work on two ambitious spending plans that would devote trillions of dollars to transportation infrastructure and social programs.While centrist Democrats are eager to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that has already won approval in the Senate, liberals say they must prioritize a $3.5 trillion budget blueprint that would expand spending on child care and education.Both measures are priorities for Democratic President Joe Biden.The first test will come on Monday evening when the House is due to vote on a package that would advance both spending bills, as well as a separate voting rights proposal.That would clear the way for a final vote on the budget plan and the voting rights bill on Tuesday, but would not set a timeline for passage of the infrastructure bill.Nine moderates who are pushing the House to first pass the infrastructure bill have threatened to vote against the package. That could potentially scuttle it in the House, where Democrats hold a 220-212 majority."There is a standoff with some of our colleagues who have decided to hold the infrastructure bill hostage for months, or kill it altogether if they don’t get what they want in the next bill," they wrote in the Washington Post on Monday.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has sided with liberals who worry they might lose leverage on the social spending effort if they first pass the infrastructure bill. She wants the House to complete work on both bills by Oct. 1."Any delay to passing the budget resolution threatens the timetable for delivering the historic progress and the transformative vision that Democrats share," Pelosi wrote fellow Democrats on Saturday.No Republicans are expected to support the budget resolution plan, which sets the broad outline for spending on education, childcare, healthcare and climate measures favoured by Biden and pays for them with tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations.Crucially, the budget resolution plan would allow Democrats to pass those spending measures on a simple majority vote in the Senate, rather than the 60 votes required for most legislation in that chamber.The Senate is split 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats. Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris has the power, however, to cast the tie-breaking vote.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  Bigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial show​Bigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8​5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the worldFrom 'Bigg Boss' star to fitness icon: Shehnaaz Gill's inspiring weight loss journey10 most powerful countries in the world in 2024Universe Guidance For Each Zodiac SignTop 10 Largest Economies In The World 2025: India To Become 4th Largest Economy Soon!

(Reuters Photo)  WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden is brushing off criticism of his administration's chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal because he and his aides believe the political fallout at home will be limited, according to White House allies and administration officials.Biden and his top aides argue they are managing an evacuation mission https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/afghanistan-edge-after-anti-taliban-protest-east-kabul-calm-airlift-goes-2021-08-19 as well as could be expected given the faster-than-anticipated takeover of the country by the Taliban, and are seeking to draw attention back to the choice to get U.S.troops out of the country.The strategy is based on internal and public polling that shows the Afghanistan withdrawal had been by far the most popular decision Biden has made, even though the issue was not central for most voters."The public opinion is pretty damn clear that Americans wanted out of the ongoing war and don't want to get back in. It's true today and it's going to be true in six months," said one Biden ally. "It isn't about not caring or being empathetic about what's going on over there but worrying about what's happening in America."Biden has faced criticism even from some fellow Democrats for his handling of the crisis.But White House officials believe Americans' horror over graphic images https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/small-afghan-girl-is-lifted-crowd-capturing-desperation-flee-kabul-2021-08-19 of the chaos in Kabul and pleas from Afghans who fear they will be killed by the Taliban will morph into support for the president's decision to pull troops from the country by Aug. 31 after a 20-year war.They expect the Afghanistan story to recede from the headlines, replaced by the resurgence in COVID-19 cases, the economic recovery and other issues, people familiar with the matter said.A White House spokesperson declined to comment.Biden aides honed talking points weeks ago to be used even in the worst-case scenarios of a withdrawal, some of which have come to pass, including emphasizing that leaving Afghanistan was the right decision."The idea that somehow, there's a way to have gotten out without chaos ensuing, I don't know how that happens," Biden told ABC News on Wednesday. "There is no good time to leave Afghanistan. Fifteen years ago would've been a problem, 15 years from now. The basic choice is am I going to send your sons and your daughters to war in Afghanistan in perpetuity?"In recent days, Biden has also assailed the Afghan military for refusing to fight, denounced the now-ousted Afghan government and declared he inherited a bad withdrawal agreement from his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump.The strategy has obvious risks, political experts say. "The concern is that it's going to undercut his credibility as commander in chief," said Jim Manley, once a top aide to former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. "If the Taliban revert to what they've done in the past, and I assume that's going to be the case, it's going to be a lot of bad images coming out of that country."INADEQUATE RESPONSEThe Afghanistan messaging is increasingly at odds with an emerging consensus within the administration that the White House, Defense and State departments as well as the U.S. intelligence community's planning for the current situation was inadequate and needs to be fully reviewed once the mission of evacuating key people from Afghanistan is complete and the 5,200 U.S. troops now in Kabul are gone."We're at the Pentagon and even we know it could have been better," said one official. "A lot better." Members of the U.S. Congress also plan to investigate what went wrong.Public opinion, at least for now, is mixed. A majority of both Republican and Democratic voters say https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-approval-drops-lowest-level-this-year-after-taliban-takeover-2021-08-17 the swift capitulation of the Afghan government "is evidence why the U.S. should get out of the conflict."Reuters/Ipsos polling this week found that 31% of American adults agreed that the United States should continue its military operations in Afghanistan, up from the 25% who felt the same way in a 2012 poll.Yet Ipsos polling https://tmsnrt.rs/3k4cwxs conducted on Monday also showed fewer than half of Americans liked the way Biden had steered the U.S. military and diplomatic effort in Afghanistan this year. They currently rate his performance worse than the other three presidents who presided over the United States' longest war, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Trump.Biden's overall approval sank to 46% of American adults in Reuters/Ipsos polling, the lowest recorded in weekly polls since he took office in January.Republicans, including Trump, have started weaponizing the withdrawal as an issue to undermine faith in Biden as commander in chief.Most Democrats are likely to embrace public support of the withdrawal decision, and the issue should die down before the November 2022 congressional elections, said one adviser working on Democratic congressional campaigns.She added, however: "The Biden administration will likely have to defend every negative headline that comes out of Afghanistan during his tenure, so that is a real unknown."End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Photostories  From being 3 months pregnant while sitting on the hotseat to her son calling Amitabh Bachchan 'dadu'; Shruthy Daga opens up about her 'arranged marriage', KBC14 Journey and more9 morning habits that can bring down cholesterol levels within a monthLaughter Chefs: From Bharti Singh- Krushna Abhishek getting emotional to Nia Sharma getting teary eyed on missing Sudesh Lehri: Top moments from the recent episodeAstro-Numerology October 2024: Sanjay B Jumaani's Predictions for Each Number (1-9)5 traditional Indian hair oils for hair growth5 herbal drinks that help in reducing blood sugar levelsHappy Gandhi Jayanti 2024: Images, Wishes, Messages, Quotes, Pictures and Greeting CardsFrom Prince Narula - Yuvika Chaudhary to Keith Sequeira - Rochelle Maria Rao; Couples who found love in the Bigg Boss houseOptical illusion psychology test: What you see first reveals what you truly want in a relationship5 body language tips to appear more confidentWinter is coming: 5 places in India for a winter vacation in October5 signs of a master manipulator, as per psychology123Hot PicksIsrael Hezbollah War LiveOldest Miss UniverseErika Carr UtahPakistan Job CutsJ&K Phase 3 Elections LiveAir Canada FinedStock Market TodayTOP TRENDINGTimeless SkillHelicopter Crashes PuneIran Israel ConflictIND vs PAK T20 World CupBrittany MahomesMorne MorkelGaurav TanejaMichael VaughanRahul GandhiBrain Exercises to Boost MemoryTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire Website"Tears of Joy and Sorrow: Brittany Mahomes’ Heartfelt Reflection Amid Family Health Struggles"'Diddy List': Names of celebrities connected to Sean Combs viralHow tall is JD Vance?

The Daniel K Inouye Solar Telescope, at the summit of Haleakalā volcano on Maui, was supposed to open last fall. But Thomas Rimmele told Hawaii Public Radio on Wednesday that the Covid-19 travel restrictions set back construction on its critical systems.He hopes the current schedule won't be affected by newly surging coronavirus cases and any additional restrictions. Rimmele was expecting to return to Maui as early as this week. "November 15 is what we're shooting for. We just had a big review, the final construction review that was conducted by the National Science Foundation," Rimmele said. "(The scientists) are getting really anxious to get their observations and data done." The telescope has received about 100 proposals from researchers for an initial observing window of two-and-a-half months. Picking, which scientists get to go first, depends heavily on atmospheric conditions and what objects are visible on a given day.  He said one quarter or even a fifth of the proposals may be approved for the first cycle. "We are highly oversubscribed and people will have to submit proposals again for the next cycle," he said. "That's just how it works."The National Solar Observatory said the Inouye telescope will be able to reveal features three times smaller than anything scientists are able to see on the Sun currently. The Hawaii Supreme Court in 2016 affirmed a permit for the solar telescope's construction. The next year, more than 100 protesters tried to block a construction convoy heading to the telescope site, citing the sacredness of Haleakala's summit. Maui police had then arrested six people.

Cricket's Rs 1,400 crore question: Should India even play Pakistan in the Asia Cup?
Pakistan’s latest meltdown against West Indies is another instance of their struggles across formats. The Asia Cup in UAE which could see them clash vs India thrice, provided both qualify for final, was meant to trigger hype and boost the broadcasters’ revenue. However, with Pakistan’s form and record vs India being so poor, one wonders how enthused cricket fans will be about what was a marquee match not too long ago

The Asia Cup in UAE which could see them clash vs India thrice, provided both qualify for final, was meant to trigger hype and boost the broadcasters’ revenue. However, with Pakistan’s form and record vs India being so poor, one wonders how enthused cricket fans will be about what was a marquee match not too long ago India could meet Pakistan thrice in the Asia Cup that will be played in September in the UAE. The debate over whether India should face Pakistan in the upcoming Asia Cup has divided opinion across the country, reflecting ongoing discussions about one of cricket’s most storied rivalries.Proponents argue that an India–Pakistan clash should proceed, asserting that the intense rivalry significantly boosts revenues, adding substantially to the coffers like no other cricket match-up. They contend that India, often regarded as the subcontinent’s ‘big brother’, has a role in financially sustaining other cricket-playing nations.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Conversely, opponents maintain that engaging in cricket matches with a nation they were at war with merely months earlier is untenable. They argue that there is no compelling reason to schedule cricket fixtures while broader bilateral tensions between the two neighbours remain unresolved.Amidst this heated debate, a common understanding among fans persists that the India–Pakistan rivalry remains cricket’s most heated and eagerly anticipated encounter. However, this perception warrants re-examination.Is the rivalry still as fierce? India and Pakistan last contested a Test match 18 years ago. Over the past 15 years, they have played 16 One Day Internationals (ODIs), with India securing twelve victories, and thirteen T20 matches, of which India has won ten.A snapshot of Pakistan's win-loss record since the 2022 T20 World Cup. The International Cricket Council (ICC) marketed the India–Pakistan match as the premier clash at the T20 World Cup in the United States last year. In the tournament, Pakistan not only lost to India but also to the hosts and the minor team USA in the first round.On Tuesday, the West Indies achieved a comprehensive victory over Pakistan in the third ODI in Tarouba, bowling them out for a mere 92 runs, underscoring the team’s ongoing struggles. Apart from home and away wins against Bangladesh earlier this year, the national team’s ODI performances have been lacklustre over the past two years.These statistics resurface regularly. Considering that India and Pakistan could potentially meet three times in the Asia Cup – during the league stage, the Super Four, and potentially the final – one wonders if it will live up to its anticipated status.India will meet Pakistan on September 14 in the group stage of the Asia Cup 2025.From an economic perspective, the India–England and India–Australia fixtures have seen exponential growth in recent years. For instance, the recent Anderson–Tendulkar Trophy, a five-Test series, recorded the highest-ever viewership numbers for digital broadcasts. Furthermore, the 2017 Border–Gavaskar series in India, followed by the 2024 leg in Australia, have become the highest-grossing bilateral cricket events to date.For the India–Pakistan rivalry to achieve similar financial success, the quality of cricket between the two nations would need a significant improvement. The primary benefits of India participating in the Asia Cup are twofold: firstly, assured financial gains for cricket boards across the subcontinent through media rights revenue; secondly, fostering goodwill ahead of discussions when India hosts the 2026 T20 World Cup.India vs Pakistan in last 15 yearsODI Matches: 17India wins: 12Pakistan wins: 4No Result: 1T20I matches: 13India wins: 10Pakistan wins: 3With media rights revenues valued at approximately Rs 1,400 crore for three tournaments (plus approximately Rs 290 crore from ground rights), each cricket board is guaranteed a minimum of Rs 290 to 332 crore over six years – an outcome unattainable without India’s involvement. In the context of the T20 World Cup, media rights revenues are several times higher than those of the Asia Cup.Ultimately, it is the financial stakes of the India–Pakistan match that remain high, while on-field competitiveness has diminished to a mere myth.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

PAK vs WI |Shoaib Akhtar - Babar aur Rizwan kab match winners banenge? ’
Following Pakistan's defeat against West Indies, Shoaib Akhtar criticized Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan for failing to be match-winners. West Indies defeated Pakistan by 202 runs, clinching the ODI series 2-1 after Jayden Seales's six-wicket haul dismantled Pakistan's batting lineup. Akhtar emphasized the need for Babar Azam to accelerate his scoring after reaching fifty, converting good starts into match-winning performances.

Ali fears a heavy loss against India and suggests that a defeat to Afghanistan would be less impactful than losing to their arch-rivals. Pakistan cricket team during the second ODI against West Indies. (ANI) Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali, among others, have raised concern about the team's chances in the Asia Cup after a harrowing defeat against West Indies in the third ODI. West Indies came from 0-1 down in the series to clinch it 2-1, ending a 34-year drought over the 1992 World Cup winners.In the third match, played in Tarouba, Pakistan managed only 92 runs while chasing a target of 295. The 202-run loss was Pakistan's fourth biggest loss in their ODI history."I pray India refuse to play against Pakistan in the Asia Cup, just like how they did at the World Championships of Legends. Itni buri tarah maarenge na vo, ki aapki soch hai," Basit Ali said on The Game Plan YouTube channel.Basit Ali further addressed the possibility of losing to Afghanistan, stating: "If we lose to Afghanistan, no one would care much in this country. But everyone goes mad the moment you lose to India."PollWill Pakistan's performance improve in the upcoming Asia Cup?Yes, they will bounce backNo, it will be more of the sameThe Pakistani batting order crumbled from the start of their chase, with three top-order wickets falling within the first three overs. Openers Saim Ayub and Abdullah Shafique, along with captain Mohammad Rizwan, were dismissed without scoring any runs.Star batter Babar Azam could only contribute 9 runs, while Salman Agha managed 30 runs before his dismissal. The entire innings concluded in just 29.2 overs, with West Indies bowler Jayden Seales delivering an exceptional performance, taking 6 wickets for 18 runs.The loss against West Indies came despite Pakistan's earlier success in the T20I series against the same opposition, which they won 2-1 under Salman Agha's leadership.The upcoming Asia Cup, scheduled to take place in the UAE, will be played in the T20 format, serving as preparation for next year's T20 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.Pakistan's T20 squad composition may differ from their ODI team, as neither Babar Azam nor Mohammad Rizwan participated in the successful T20I series against West Indies, a pattern that might continue in the Asia Cup.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

'Shouldn't have had a place': Irfan Pathan's brutal take on Rohit Sharma playing Test cricket in 2024
Irfan Pathan suggested that Rohit Sharma's place in the Test team was potentially in jeopardy during 2024 due to poor performances, particularly highlighting his struggles in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Pathan acknowledged the perception of biased support towards Sharma, and argued that he only kept his place in the squad because he was captain.

Rohit Sharma retired from Tests in May (Image via Getty Images) Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has claimed that Rohit Sharma might have found it difficult to retain his place in the Test team during the latter half of 2024 had he not been the captain.Pathan recalled Rohit’s poor run during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia earlier that year. The opener averaged just 6.20 across three matches before opting out of the final Test in Sydney. “Rohit Sharma is an amazing player in white-ball cricket, but his average in Test cricket that year was 6, so we said that if he was not the captain, he would not have had a place in the team, and this is true,” Pathan said, speaking in a Lallantop video.IRFAN PATHAN FLYING FROM MUMBAI SPOTTED AT AIRPORTGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! At the time, Rohit addressed the decision in an interview with Pathan and Jatin Sapru during the match on January 5. “This is what I say. Stand down. I will say a few words, fifty words will be made out of it. So basically, runs are not coming from my bat, I am not in form, it is an important match, we need players in form, the boys in our batting are not in form, so you cannot carry too many out-of-form players in the team,” Rohit had explained. “It was difficult for me to take this decision but if everything is put in front of us, then this decision was sensible, and I will not think too much ahead. What the team needed at this time, this was the only thought, and there was no other thought apart from that,” he added. Pathan also addressed perceptions that he and others had been overly supportive of Rohit. “People say that we supported Rohit Sharma more than necessary. Of course, when someone comes to interview on your broadcasting channel, you will not misbehave with them, right? You have invited him, so you will behave politely… we had to show that, because he was our guest,” Pathan said.PollDo you think Rohit Sharma would have retained his place in the Test team if he wasn't captain?Yes, definitelyNo, he would have been dropped However, he maintained his stance on Rohit’s place in the side. “We had said that he should keep fighting, but that said, he should not have had a place in the playing XI. If he was not the captain of the team, he would have been dropped.” Rohit later rediscovered his touch in white-ball cricket, guiding India to the Champions Trophy title in March 2025, before retiring from Test cricket on May 7.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Ravindra Jadeja faces scrutiny over his ODI strike rate. Axar Patel emerges as a strong contender, showcasing impactful performances. Washington Sundar is also in contention. India's Ravindra Jadeja  (AP/PTI) A lull in India’s cricketing calendar allows space and time for various stories to come out. With the country still delusional over the team’s thrilling six-run victory at The Oval to square the series against England 2-2, media reports emerged that Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, two batting stalwarts and players, who had already bid adieu to Tests and T20Is, could be playing in their last 50-over series Down Under in Oct.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! For fans of the two players, who were expected to bow out only after the 50-over World Cup in Oct-Nov 2027 in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia, it came as a shock. The fan clubs of the two players, always at war on social media, were united in grief after reading reports of their probable exit from ODIs as they directed their collective ire at chief selector Ajit Agarkar and coach Gautam Gambhir. While plenty was discussed about the white-ball futures of both Rohit and Virat and how unfair it was to make the two stalwarts go through the grind of playing Vijay Hazare Trophy and India A games to prove themselves, another cricketer might be skating on thin ice when it comes to his white-ball future.Ravindra Jadeja, the Saurashtra stalwart, might have had his best series as a batter in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy with 516 runs and six half-centuries, but his strike rate in ODIs has been a subject of debate as it has not been at par with the pace at which runs are scored in the format lately. In 204 ODIs, his 2,806 runs have been scored at a strike rate of 85.44. The fact that he has batted at No.7 or lower, a position where big-hitters walk in and target the boundaries, puts additional scrutiny on those numbers. In fact, in the 11 games that he has batted in at No.6, his average of 30 and strike rate of 81.44 also does not meet modern requirements. Jadeja’s last outing at that number was his laborious 22-ball 9 in the 2023 World Cup final at Ahmedabad, where he was strangely sent in ahead of Surya Kumar Yadav, curiously to inject some pace in the innings that had got stuck as KL Rahul and Virat Kohli erred on the side of caution while rebuilding the innings after India lost three wickets for 81 runs. Jadeja has batted at No.7 98 times in 148 matches and has scored 2,000 runs at 83.41. In 2023, that strike rate had dropped to 79.16. With the death overs of modern ODI batting requiring explosive skills, India would be justified in looking at someone with a wider range of strokes and greater power.PollWho do you think is more crucial for India’s ODI success moving forward?Ravindra JadejaAxar PatelWashington Sundar In Axar Patel, they probably have an ideal like-for-like replacement. The lanky Gujarat southpaw batted at No.5 in the 2024 T20 World Cup final against South Africa at Barbados, and, despite India stuttering at 34 for 3, belted a momentum-changing 31-ball 47 that allowed Kohli the freedom to drop anchor and bat deep. Axar was a floater in the batting order during the victorious campaign and had been used tactically, especially as a hitter against spin on the sluggish pitches in the Caribbean. On spin-friendly surfaces in the sub-continent, West Indies and Dubai, he has been used to break the monotony of right-handers following each other. In the Champions Trophy in the UAE, his 30-ball 27 in the semifinal against Australia and his 29, which included the tactical takedown of Mitchell Santner of New Zealand in the final, made the equation more comfortable for the lower order. Axar’s average of 22.37 may not appear earth-shattering, but the fact that he has scored those runs at 91.47 at crucial times makes him an attractive package in ODIs. In Indian victories, he has scored his runs at 97.97. Because his batting has come along wonderfully, Axar’s bowling is seldom discussed. Finger spinners, thanks to modern batting-friendly field restrictions and rules, have been reduced to cannon fodder. However, his fastish round-arm finger spin has cost India only 4.49 runs per over. He may not have had a five-wicket haul to show for his efforts yet in the 63 times he has bowled in ODIs, but that could be because he has completed his quota of 10 overs just 29 times in his career. His average (32.94) and strike rate (43.9) also make him a useful option. Jadeja, who has bowled in 196 innings in the 204 times he has played for India in the blue jersey, has picked up 231 scalps at 35.41 and an economy rate of 4.85. His strike rate of 43.7 is better, though, than Axar’s. What goes in favour of Axar is the fact that he often bowls in the powerplay in T20s and in the IPL and wouldn’t be averse to doing it in the ODIs too. The speed at which he bowls and the height at which the balls comes down makes charging at him difficult for batters. Both Jadeja and Axar are assets in the field. But India now also have another talented spin-bowling all-rounder in the form of Washington Sundar, who can strike it big in the end overs and is technically adept to bat in the top-6. The fact that he is still only 25, is a safe fielder and an excellent powerplay bowler, makes him an attractive option for captains and coaches to lend balance to the team and field a long batting order. Both Rohit and Virat probably lost the right to go to England because of a sustained poor run in Tests. In ODIs, though, their numbers have been excellent. It is only their age and the fact they would be 40 and 39 respectively when the 2027 ODI World Cup comes around that has made the management wary about picking them beyond Australia. Jadeja too would be close to 39 when the World Cup is staged in 2027.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

The double ton in Birmingham is obviously something I’ll cherish forever and will be one of the highlights of my tour to England.”Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Gill’s numbers backed up his words. He was the standout performer in the Anderson Tendulkar Trophy, scoring 754 runs in 10 innings at an average of 75.40. July alone brought him 567 runs in three Tests at an average of 94.50, including three centuries and a career-best 269 at Edgbaston. That innings was not only a personal milestone but also the spark for India’s comeback after losing the series opener in Leeds.PollDo you believe Shubman Gill will continue to excel as India's captain in future series?Yes, definitelyProbablyUncertainNo, I don't think so His 430-run aggregate in Birmingham is one of the highest in Test history and the best by any visiting batter in England. Along the way, Gill surpassed Sunil Gavaskar’s record for most runs in a Test series as Indian captain and became the first Asian to score more than 700 runs in a series on English soil. While he had lean patches at Lord’s and The Oval, his earlier contributions ensured India finished the series 2-2. The award is Gill’s fourth, cementing his status as one of the game’s most consistent and impactful players.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

The comment referenced Root's record against Hazlewood, who has dismissed him 10 times in 31 innings at an average of 31.40.Speaking to Sky Sports Root responded to Warner's comments with composure, saying: "Just that. I have no control over how people perceive the game or discuss it in an interview. Nothing new, is it? You know there are going to be storylines and people wanting to hype up a big series. Does not really change anything. It is sort of irrelevant to me. What can I do about it? Just make sure it is not a talking point in six months or 100 days' time."The English batter further added: "When you get out there, you have to got to try and impact the game and help your team get off to a good start. Business as usual as far as I am concerned. I guess it is all part of the fun. We will see what happens out there [with Warner at Lord's during The Hundred, where they are playing for Trent Rockets and London Spirit respectively]. It is not really in my nature to get too verbal."PollWill Joe Root score a century in the Ashes series?Yes, definitelyNo, not likelyMaybe, depends on conditionsRoot's performance in Australia has been notable despite not scoring a century there. He has accumulated 892 runs in 14 Tests and 27 innings, maintaining an average of over 35 with nine half-centuries and a highest score of 89.The pre-series verbal exchanges between players from both teams are considered a common strategy to create psychological pressure before the matches begin.Both Root and Warner will face each other at Lord's during The Hundred tournament, where they represent Trent Rockets and London Spirit respectively, before the Ashes series begins.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

RR reportedly approached Chennai Super Kings, expressing interest in Ravindra Jadeja or Ruturaj Gaikwad in exchange for Samson, but CSK is unwilling to release these key players. Ruturaj Gaikwad, Sanju Samson and Ravindra Jadeja. The uncertainty over Sanju Samson’s future with Rajasthan Royals has grown, with fresh reports indicating that the franchise is actively working on potential trade options for their captain. As reported by Cricbuzz, RR have reached out to multiple IPL franchises to check if they are interested in acquiring the India wicketkeeper-batter. Lead owner Manoj Badale is said to be personally involved in the discussions. According to Cricbuzz, during these talks, Badale has even named specific players from other teams that the Royals would want in exchange for Samson. In the case of Chennai Super Kings, it is believed RR asked for either Ravindra Jadeja or Ruturaj Gaikwad as part of a swap. These demands are understood to be deal-breakers for CSK, who are not willing to release two of their most important players.What went wrong with CSK in IPL 2025Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Shivam Dube’s name has also been mentioned in some conversations, but Chennai are reportedly unwilling to part with the India all-rounder either. In fact, CSK officials are said to be reluctant to release any of their current players. This makes a direct swap between Samson and CSK seem unlikely at present, unless lengthy negotiations change the equation or Samson’s name comes up in the auction. However, there is no certainty that Samson will even enter the auction. RR are believed to be in serious trade talks with more than one team, and there is interest from several other franchises. This means another franchise could step in and finalise a deal before the auction stage. Samson, who has been with RR for several seasons and captained them in recent years, has reportedly made a formal request to the management for a move, stating that he wants to take his career in a new direction. Over the past seasons, there have been reports of differences between Samson and the team’s decision-makers.PollWhich player would you prefer to see swapped for Sanju Samson?Ravindra JadejaRuturaj GaikwadShivam DubeNone of the aboveOne point of tension was the Royals’ choice to release Jos Buttler before the last season while retaining Shimron Hetmyer. Samson had previously told Star Sports that letting Buttler go was one of the most difficult calls for him, and during a dinner with Buttler in the England series, he admitted he was still not over it. Despite these issues, Samson has avoided making any negative public comments about the franchise. In a recent podcast with R Ashwin, he said the Rajasthan Royals setup means a lot to him and spoke highly of Vaibhav Suryavanshi, the young left-handed batter who replaced him at the top of the order in the RR batting line-up. If a suitable trade does not materialise, Samson could still remain with Rajasthan Royals, as releasing or trading a player is entirely the franchise’s decision. The player’s role in this process is limited to making a formal request. For now, the situation remains open-ended, and it is clear that Samson’s next move will be one of the biggest talking points of the upcoming IPL off-season.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

SUBSCRIBE NOW! “No, I don’t think the quality was as good as ’05. I mean, I don’t think I’ll see a better series than the ’05 Ashes. One team on the rise, one great team on the decline, an emerging team with absolutely great players at the top of their game,” Atherton said on Sky Sports Cricket. He explained that while 2005 set an unmatched benchmark, this latest series stood out for its unpredictable nature. “I’d probably put this one as the best since ’05 because of those dramatic moments — like Chris Woakes, and Rishabh Pant, and the way the series twisted and turned. So I reckon it’s probably the best series I’ve covered since ’05,” he added.IND vs ENG: Mohammed Siraj reflects on memorable win at The Oval The five-match contest ended 2-2 after India sealed a tense victory in the final Test at The Oval. The last day saw wickets fall quickly and emotions run high in a fiercely fought battle between the two sides. In contrast, the 2005 Ashes, which is widely considered one of the greatest Test series in history, saw England edge Australia 2-1 to reclaim the urn for the first time since 1986-87. That series remains remembered for its high-quality cricket, nail-biting finishes and lasting impact on the sport.PollWhich series do you think had more dramatic moments?2025 India-England Series2005 Ashes SeriesWhile Atherton’s verdict doesn't place the series on par or better than the 2005 Ashes, he still placed the India-England clash in elite company.

Virat Kohli (AFP Photo) NEW DELHI: Former India captain Virat Kohli, who has retired from T20Is and Tests and now focuses solely on ODIs, is gearing up for the Australia series in October after the postponement of the Bangladesh ODI series in August.

SUBSCRIBE NOW!In the image shared on his Instagram story, Kohli was seen training with Gujarat Titans’ assistant coach Naeem Amin. “Thanks for helping out with the hit, brother. Always lovely to see you,” he wrote. A fan page later reposted the picture, hinting at Kohli’s preparation for the Australian ODIs — a post that received a like from Kohli’s official account.Both Kohli and Rohit Sharma continue to feature in ODIs after stepping away from T20Is and Tests. Rohit remains the ODI captain, while Kohli is still a central figure in the format. The BCCI, however, is treading carefully regarding their long-term ODI futures, with age emerging as a key discussion point. By the 2027 ODI World Cup, Rohit will be 40 and Kohli 39.Despite this, their combined ODI record — 83 centuries and over 25,000 runs — underscores their value to the team. While India have transitioned from relying on them in other formats, their impact in 50-over cricket remains significant. The Australia series, set for October 19–25, will be India’s next ODI assignment, with both veterans expected to play vital roles.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Asia Cup | Shubman Gill - BCCI's new poster boy should lead India in T20Is too
With Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma all but retired, the BCCI’s search for a new on-field leader and marketable face has turned to Shubman Gill. Already India’s Test captain, his growing brand value, T20I record, and leadership credentials make him a strong contender for the white-ball captaincy as well.

Already India’s Test captain, his growing brand value, T20I record, and leadership credentials make him a strong contender for the white-ball captaincy as well. London: India's captain Shubman Gill acknowledges the crowd after India won the fifth Test match against England, at The Oval cricket ground, in London, England. (PTI Photo/R Senthilkumar)(PTI08_04_2025_000309B) New Delhi: In the past few weeks, social media videos have been doing the rounds where Shubman Gill's dismissals in Test cricket and then his centuries in the recently concluded Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy have been heavily compared. The lyrics from the song "Kachha Ghada" by singer Rahgir have been used, and the line says: “Ye jo has rahi hai duniya, meri nakamiyon pe... kal ye marenge taali meri kahaniyon pe” (Those who are mocking me for my failures today will clap for my story tomorrow).Eyebrows were raised when he was appointed as India's Test captain, with legends of the game questioning his spot in the playing XI. He answered his critics with 754 runs, almost overhauling Sunil Gavaskar's all-time record, and was presented with a customised shirt and cap by the 'Little Master.'IND vs ENG: Shubman Gill on Oval thriller, Siraj's spell, and missing Rishabh Pant and Jasprit BumrahGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Shubman Gill, a Gen Z, used Karan Aujla's famous track Ghabru on his Insagram with the caption, “The storm only rattles those who aren't ready for it.” He answered all his critics in a very nonchalant way -- both with his bat and his captaincy.India's captain Shubman Gill celebrates after scoring a century on the final day of the fourth cricket test match between England and India at Emirates Old Trafford, Manchester, England, July 27, 2025.(AP Photo/Jon Super)England wicketkeeper-batter Jos Buttler, who played under Gill's captaincy at the Gujarat Titans, has called his style of leadership a combination of the “intensity” of Virat Kohli and the “more laid-back” approach of Rohit Sharma. Buttler was right -- Gill hassled England with intent and elegance.The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) took a gamble, and Shubman swiftly filled the void left by Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma -- two of its biggest modern-day giants.Gill is not only filling the void with runs and leadership but also in brand value, and has already become the darling of the broadcasters. The leap can be gauged by MRF's investment on legendary batters going from Sachin Tendulkar to Virat Kohli and now Gill in a deal estimated to be worth Rs 8-10 crore per year.Remember the Virat Kohli Cam and Rohit Sharma Cam that broadcasters added to keep fans glued? Shubman is their answer.The other poster boy of Indian cricket is Jasprit Bumrah, hands down the magician who wears many hats. But with his persistent back injury and workload management, he won't be playing all of India’s matches.The brand equationFrom a commercial standpoint, Kohli and Rohit weren’t just cricketers; they were multi-million-dollar brands. Their mere presence boosted television ratings, ticket sales, and sponsorship value. Broadcasters built campaigns around them. Sponsors tailored entire ad shoots to their availability. Losing both at once was always going to create a vacuum, and the BCCI’s marketing minds are well aware that a successor must be groomed not just on the field, but in the marketplace.With Shubman Gill, they have a young poster boy for the next generation. With his elegant strokeplay, calm demeanour, and youthful appeal, he has already become a favourite with advertisers.Suryakumar Yadav has an impressive track record as India’s full-time T20I captain after Rohit Sharma retired from the format following the 2024 T20 World Cup triumph. Under his leadership, India have won 17 out of 22 matches.New Delhi, Aug 8 (IANS) Former India wicketkeeper-batter Parthiv Patel believes Test skipper Shubman Gill answered all challenges and questions through his prolific run-scoring spree during the recently drawn Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy series against England.There is no question about Surya the T20I batter -- he can entertain the crowd. But can he fill stadiums?This is the question coach Gautam Gambhir, chief selector Ajit Agarkar, and top BCCI officials will have to answer during the Asia Cup squad selection, given that the T20 World Cup will be played at home. Will they extend the line of thought by giving Shubman the white-ball captaincy as well? It would also make life easier for coach Gambhir. No coach anywhere in the world would want to deal with different captains for different formats.Numbers don’t lieBy no means is Shubman Gill a dud in the T20I format.In 21 T20Is, his strike rate is close to 140, and with added responsibility, he can only flourish - as seen in England. His Test average was in the mid-30s before the start of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, and he ended up chasing Don Bradman's batting record. Gill has shown that he is someone who will not buckle under added responsibility; instead, he thrives on it.In the IPL, he captains Gujarat Titans. In the first season, he showed some vulnerability but bounced back in his second season as captain, guiding them to the playoffs.New Delhi, Aug 7 (IANS) After captaining India to a 2-2 Test series draw in England, Shubman Gill has been appointed as the captain of the North Zone squad for the upcoming Duleep Trophy, starting on August 28 in Bengaluru.Since moving to Titans from Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), Gill has risen immediately to the leadership group under then-captain Hardik Pandya. He was pivotal in Titans winning the IPL title in 2022 with 483 runs at the top. Next season, he responded with an 890-run season with a strike rate of 157.80. In the last three IPL seasons, his strike rates have been 158.80, 147.40, and 155.88.His childhood mentor Gurkeerat Singh Mann has explained how Gill worked on his power-hitting.“He has always been a traditional batter, who was told by his father that hitting in the air is a sin in cricket. But once he was tipped as not good enough for T20I cricket, he added that power game to his repertoire -- and now see the sixes he hits, all of them above 90m,” Mann told TimesofIndia.com.“Before he joined Gujarat Titans, he started training in an open net at the IS Bindra Stadium in Mohali. He wanted to make sure that he was hitting it long and big. He was not happy with the sixes falling just behind the ropes. He used to get miffed. But that tells you his hunger to improve,” he added.PollDo you believe Shubman Gill can fill the leadership void left by Kohli and Sharma?AbsolutelySomewhatNot reallyNot at allIf the BCCI takes the bait by making Gill captain for the Asia Cup, it will provide them with the opportunity to build a young, fearless side under a fresh leader -- a rare combination.With two giants gone and Bumrah’s appearances in internationals carefully rationed, Gill could be the steady, stylish, and strategic leader India needs -- one who can carry the team on the field and the brand off it. The stage is his; the time might just be now.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

'If they are saying so much to Sachin …': When Dravid took a cheeky dig at crowd criticism

The Asia Cup in UAE which could see them clash vs India thrice, provided both qualify for final, was meant to trigger hype and boost the broadcasters’ revenue. However, with Pakistan’s form and record vs India being so poor, one wonders how enthused cricket fans will be about what was a marquee match not too long ago India could meet Pakistan thrice in the Asia Cup that will be played in September in the UAE. The debate over whether India should face Pakistan in the upcoming Asia Cup has divided opinion across the country, reflecting ongoing discussions about one of cricket’s most storied rivalries.Proponents argue that an India–Pakistan clash should proceed, asserting that the intense rivalry significantly boosts revenues, adding substantially to the coffers like no other cricket match-up. They contend that India, often regarded as the subcontinent’s ‘big brother’, has a role in financially sustaining other cricket-playing nations.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Conversely, opponents maintain that engaging in cricket matches with a nation they were at war with merely months earlier is untenable. They argue that there is no compelling reason to schedule cricket fixtures while broader bilateral tensions between the two neighbours remain unresolved.Amidst this heated debate, a common understanding among fans persists that the India–Pakistan rivalry remains cricket’s most heated and eagerly anticipated encounter. However, this perception warrants re-examination.Is the rivalry still as fierce? India and Pakistan last contested a Test match 18 years ago. Over the past 15 years, they have played 16 One Day Internationals (ODIs), with India securing twelve victories, and thirteen T20 matches, of which India has won ten.A snapshot of Pakistan's win-loss record since the 2022 T20 World Cup. The International Cricket Council (ICC) marketed the India–Pakistan match as the premier clash at the T20 World Cup in the United States last year. In the tournament, Pakistan not only lost to India but also to the hosts and the minor team USA in the first round.On Tuesday, the West Indies achieved a comprehensive victory over Pakistan in the third ODI in Tarouba, bowling them out for a mere 92 runs, underscoring the team’s ongoing struggles. Apart from home and away wins against Bangladesh earlier this year, the national team’s ODI performances have been lacklustre over the past two years.These statistics resurface regularly. Considering that India and Pakistan could potentially meet three times in the Asia Cup – during the league stage, the Super Four, and potentially the final – one wonders if it will live up to its anticipated status.India will meet Pakistan on September 14 in the group stage of the Asia Cup 2025.From an economic perspective, the India–England and India–Australia fixtures have seen exponential growth in recent years. For instance, the recent Anderson–Tendulkar Trophy, a five-Test series, recorded the highest-ever viewership numbers for digital broadcasts. Furthermore, the 2017 Border–Gavaskar series in India, followed by the 2024 leg in Australia, have become the highest-grossing bilateral cricket events to date.For the India–Pakistan rivalry to achieve similar financial success, the quality of cricket between the two nations would need a significant improvement. The primary benefits of India participating in the Asia Cup are twofold: firstly, assured financial gains for cricket boards across the subcontinent through media rights revenue; secondly, fostering goodwill ahead of discussions when India hosts the 2026 T20 World Cup.India vs Pakistan in last 15 yearsODI Matches: 17India wins: 12Pakistan wins: 4No Result: 1T20I matches: 13India wins: 10Pakistan wins: 3With media rights revenues valued at approximately Rs 1,400 crore for three tournaments (plus approximately Rs 290 crore from ground rights), each cricket board is guaranteed a minimum of Rs 290 to 332 crore over six years – an outcome unattainable without India’s involvement. In the context of the T20 World Cup, media rights revenues are several times higher than those of the Asia Cup.Ultimately, it is the financial stakes of the India–Pakistan match that remain high, while on-field competitiveness has diminished to a mere myth.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

Pakistan cricket team during the second ODI against West Indies. (ANI) Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali, among others, have raised concern about the team's chances in the Asia Cup after a harrowing defeat against West Indies in the third ODI. West Indies came from 0-1 down in the series to clinch it 2-1, ending a 34-year drought over the 1992 World Cup winners.In the third match, played in Tarouba, Pakistan managed only 92 runs while chasing a target of 295. The 202-run loss was Pakistan's fourth biggest loss in their ODI history."I pray India refuse to play against Pakistan in the Asia Cup, just like how they did at the World Championships of Legends. Itni buri tarah maarenge na vo, ki aapki soch hai," Basit Ali said on The Game Plan YouTube channel.Basit Ali further addressed the possibility of losing to Afghanistan, stating: "If we lose to Afghanistan, no one would care much in this country. But everyone goes mad the moment you lose to India."PollWill Pakistan's performance improve in the upcoming Asia Cup?Yes, they will bounce backNo, it will be more of the sameThe Pakistani batting order crumbled from the start of their chase, with three top-order wickets falling within the first three overs. Openers Saim Ayub and Abdullah Shafique, along with captain Mohammad Rizwan, were dismissed without scoring any runs.Star batter Babar Azam could only contribute 9 runs, while Salman Agha managed 30 runs before his dismissal. The entire innings concluded in just 29.2 overs, with West Indies bowler Jayden Seales delivering an exceptional performance, taking 6 wickets for 18 runs.The loss against West Indies came despite Pakistan's earlier success in the T20I series against the same opposition, which they won 2-1 under Salman Agha's leadership.The upcoming Asia Cup, scheduled to take place in the UAE, will be played in the T20 format, serving as preparation for next year's T20 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.Pakistan's T20 squad composition may differ from their ODI team, as neither Babar Azam nor Mohammad Rizwan participated in the successful T20I series against West Indies, a pattern that might continue in the Asia Cup.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.

'Shouldn't have had a place': Irfan Pathan's brutal take on Rohit Sharma playing Test cricket in 2024
Irfan Pathan suggested that Rohit Sharma's place in the Test team was potentially in jeopardy during 2024 due to poor performances, particularly highlighting his struggles in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Pathan acknowledged the perception of biased support towards Sharma, and argued that he only kept his place in the squad because he was captain.

Pathan acknowledged the perception of biased support towards Sharma, and argued that he only kept his place in the squad because he was captain. Rohit Sharma retired from Tests in May (Image via Getty Images) Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has claimed that Rohit Sharma might have found it difficult to retain his place in the Test team during the latter half of 2024 had he not been the captain.Pathan recalled Rohit’s poor run during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia earlier that year. The opener averaged just 6.20 across three matches before opting out of the final Test in Sydney. “Rohit Sharma is an amazing player in white-ball cricket, but his average in Test cricket that year was 6, so we said that if he was not the captain, he would not have had a place in the team, and this is true,” Pathan said, speaking in a Lallantop video.IRFAN PATHAN FLYING FROM MUMBAI SPOTTED AT AIRPORTGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! At the time, Rohit addressed the decision in an interview with Pathan and Jatin Sapru during the match on January 5. “This is what I say. Stand down. I will say a few words, fifty words will be made out of it. So basically, runs are not coming from my bat, I am not in form, it is an important match, we need players in form, the boys in our batting are not in form, so you cannot carry too many out-of-form players in the team,” Rohit had explained. “It was difficult for me to take this decision but if everything is put in front of us, then this decision was sensible, and I will not think too much ahead. What the team needed at this time, this was the only thought, and there was no other thought apart from that,” he added. Pathan also addressed perceptions that he and others had been overly supportive of Rohit. “People say that we supported Rohit Sharma more than necessary. Of course, when someone comes to interview on your broadcasting channel, you will not misbehave with them, right? You have invited him, so you will behave politely… we had to show that, because he was our guest,” Pathan said.PollDo you think Rohit Sharma would have retained his place in the Test team if he wasn't captain?Yes, definitelyNo, he would have been dropped However, he maintained his stance on Rohit’s place in the side. “We had said that he should keep fighting, but that said, he should not have had a place in the playing XI. If he was not the captain of the team, he would have been dropped.” Rohit later rediscovered his touch in white-ball cricket, guiding India to the Champions Trophy title in March 2025, before retiring from Test cricket on May 7.Catch Rani Rampal's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 4.
