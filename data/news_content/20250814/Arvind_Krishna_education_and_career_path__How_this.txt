Raised in an Army family, his early exposure to diverse environments fostered adaptability. He spearheaded IBM's strategic shift towards hybrid cloud and AI, highlighted by the pivotal acquisition of Red Hat, solidifying his legacy as an innovator and leader. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna When Arvind Krishna walked into his first electrical engineering lecture at IIT Kanpur in 1981, few could have guessed that the young student from an Army family in India would one day take charge of one of the most storied technology companies in the world. Today, as chairman and CEO of IBM, Krishna leads a global workforce, drives innovation in artificial intelligence and hybrid cloud, and steers the company’s vision for quantum computing. His journey spanning Indian classrooms, American research labs, and corporate boardrooms is a powerful reminder of how education and determination can transform a career.From Army family to global classroomBorn on November 23, 1962, in Andhra Pradesh’s West Godavari district, Arvind Krishna was raised in a family where service and discipline were woven into daily life. His father, Major General Vinod Krishna, served in the Indian Army, while his mother, Aarathi Krishna, devoted her time to the welfare of Army widows. Moving frequently during his childhood exposed him to diverse learning environments, including Stanes Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School in Coonoor and St Joseph’s Academy in Dehradun. This early exposure to varied cultures and academic settings helped develop the adaptability that would later serve him in the fast-changing world of technology.Engineering excellence at IIT Kanpur and UIUCIn 1981, Krishna joined the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur to study electrical engineering. The rigorous academic environment honed his analytical thinking and problem-solving skills, and in 1985 he graduated with a BTech in Electrical Engineering. Eager to deepen his expertise, he moved to the United States and enrolled at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where he pursued advanced research in computer networks and systems. In 1991, he earned his PhD in Electrical Engineering, a qualification that would anchor his credibility as both a technologist and a leader.Three decades of innovation at IBMKrishna joined IBM’s Thomas J. Watson Research Center in 1990, starting in research roles that allowed him to combine technical depth with creative problem-solving. Over the next 18 years, he contributed to breakthroughs in databases, systems, and networking. Moving into executive roles, he led IBM’s Information Management Software and Systems & Technology Group before being promoted in 2015 to Senior Vice President of IBM Research. Later, as head of IBM’s Cloud and Cognitive Software division, he expanded the company’s presence in AI, blockchain, hybrid cloud, and quantum computing. His most notable strategic achievement came in 2019, when he was the driving force behind IBM’s $34 billion acquisition of Red Hat — the largest in the company’s history.From researcher to CEOIn January 2020, IBM named Arvind Krishna as the successor to Ginni Rometty, and on April 6, 2020, he officially took over as CEO. Just a year later, he was appointed Chairman of IBM’s Board. Under his leadership, IBM has sharpened its focus on hybrid cloud platforms, AI-driven solutions, and advanced computing technologies to stay ahead in an intensely competitive industry. Despite his corporate responsibilities, Krishna remains connected to his roots as a researcher, holding 15 patents, editing IEEE and ACM journals, and publishing extensively in technical literature.Ready to navigate global policies?
