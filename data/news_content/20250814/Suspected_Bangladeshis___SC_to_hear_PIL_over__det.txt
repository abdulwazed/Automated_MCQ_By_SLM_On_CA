If we pass any interim orders, then it will have consequences, especially those who have illegally come from across the border and need to be deported under the law," the bench said, as quoted by PTI.The top court told advocate Prashant Bhushan, representing the West Bengal Migrant Welfare Board, to await responses from the Central government and nine states: Odisha, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Delhi, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana and West Bengal.The case centres around individuals allegedly facing harassment by states solely for speaking Bengali and possessing Bengali-language documents, following a Ministry of Home Affairs circular, as argued by Bhushan."They are being detained while an inquiry is being held about their bonafide and in some cases, they are even tortured. Kindly pass some interim order that no detention will be held. I have no problem with enquiries but there should not be any detention," the advocate said in his argument.The apex court, however, did acknowledge the necessity to establish procedures to protect legitimate citizens from harassment.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.
