Despite financial assistance from friends and colleagues, his health deteriorated, leading to his passing. (Picture Courtesy: Facebook) The Kannada film fraternity is mourning the loss of director Murali Mohan, a filmmaker who left a lasting imprint on the industry through his collaborations with some of its biggest stars.Best known for helming 'Nagarahavu' with Real Star Upendra, Santha with Hat-trick Hero Shivarajkumar, and Mallikarjuna with Crazy Star Ravichandran, Murali Mohan passed away in Bengaluru on August 13. He was 57. His death comes after a long and difficult battle with kidney-related ailments.The news was shared by the director Prakasharaj Mehu via social media. Taking to Facebook handle he wrote, "Murali Mohan was one of the driving forces behind the film Om! The reason I say this is because, during the story discussions at Vajreshwari Productions that I was part of, every time the topic of Om came up, Varadanna would fondly remember Murali and the contribution he made to that film!! He praised Murali’s intelligence. It is a tragedy that his true talent was never fully utilised in the Kannada film industry!!!"Prakasharaj Mehu further wrote, "Seeing people like him makes one believe the saying that nothing else grows under a big banyan tree. Murali, who always spoke about God, religion, meditation, homa, and havan, appeared to me more like the head of a monastery than a film director. He had bought a plot in Uttarahalli, but it got caught up with the Rajakaluve (stormwater drain). He struggled a lot to save it. Today, he has become free from all such concerns. Salutations to you, Murali — may the heaven you believed in be yours…” — Prakash Raj Mehu, Writer and Film Director."A long fight against illnessFor years, Murali Mohan had been undergoing treatment at a private hospital on JC Road in Bengaluru. His condition had required costly surgeries. Reportedly, he had publicly appealed for financial help when medical expenses mounted to an estimated Rs 30–35 lakh. Friends, colleagues, and well-wishers rallied to his side, raising funds and offering support. Despite their efforts, his health continued to decline, and he breathed his last on Wednesday.Friendship with UpendraMurali Mohan’s had a long standing bond with the superstar Upendra. That bond evolved into a creative partnership on several projects, including cult hits like 'Om', 'Shhh', and 'Tarle Nan Maga', where he contributed behind the scenes.About the AuthorEntertainment Deskमटा मनोरंजन डेस्क ही मराठी आणि हिंदी चित्रपट, ओटीटी, संगीत, मराठी टीव्ही कार्यक्रम, वेब सिरीज आणि सेलिब्रिटी बातम्यांवर केंद्रित एक उत्साही टीम आहे. चित्रपट समीक्षण, कलाकारांच्या मुलाखती, ट्रेलर विश्लेषण, गॉसिप्स आणि सोशल मीडिया ट्रेंड्सवरील विश्वासार्ह आणि मनोरंजक माहिती आम्ही सर्जनशील शैलीत वाचकांपर्यंत पोहोचवितो. माहिती आणि मनोरंजन यांचा समतोल राखणे हे आमचे वैशिष्ट्य आहे.Read MoreEnd of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Why is the Peepal tree worshipped in India5 early symptoms of Diabetes in men that should not be ignoredCardiologist says these blood tests that can predict heart disease risks even before symptoms appearTemples, Taj, and Thar: An epic 15-day adventure in the heart of North IndiaThis is how cooking meat may increase the risk of cancerFrom bullied schoolboy to ₹3,000 crore superstar – Hrithik Roshan’s inspiring journeyHow to see incredible India in just two weeksSeeds that supercharge muscle growth and overall healthFrom Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leavesTop 5 Getaways in North and South India to Work Remotely123Top TrendingTyreek HillVanessa BryantDwyane WadeKyrie lrvingNHL Trade RumorsShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn SectionEntire WebsiteMaharashtra NEET UG counselling 2025 round 1 seat allotment list out: Check direct link to download hereSBI Clerk waitlist 2025 out for Junior Associates at sbi.co.in: Check direct link to download PDF list hereRussell Wilson's wife Ciara becomes first descendants of enslaved Africans to receive Benin citizenship under historic new lawNBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Eye Potential Austin Reaves Trade for $36.37 Million Sacramento Kings Star Duo;
