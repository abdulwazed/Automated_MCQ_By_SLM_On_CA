The case has been reassigned to a three-judge bench led by Justice Vikram Nath for rehearing.  NEW DELHI: In a significant decision coming two days after Justice J B Pardiwala-led two-judge bench's controversial order for removal of all stray dogs from Delhi and NCR streets, Chief Justice B R Gavai Wednesday withdrew the case from that bench and posted it for rehearing on Thursday before a three-judge special bench led by Justice Vikram Nath.In the much-criticised Aug 11 order, Justices Pardiwala and R Mahadevan had directed Delhi and NCR civic authorities to "start picking up and rounding up stray dogs from all localities of Delhi, Ghaziabad, Noida, Faridabad, Gurgaon as well as areas on the outskirts, and relocate these dogs to designated shelters/pounds."Prompted by pleas from two counsel - one of whom pointed to the order's apparent conflict with a previous judgment of another apex court bench - and the excoriating criticism of SC by animal lovers, activists and the public, CJI Gavai moved speedily to withdraw the matter from Justice Pardiwala's bench and assign it to Justices Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria.Apex court disposed of two dozen pleas last yr On May 9, 2024, a bench of Justices J K Maheshwari and Sanjay Karol had passed an elaborate order disposing of two dozen petitions filed by Kerala, Animal Welfare Board, NGOs and animal lovers appealing against conflicting high court orders on removal of stray dogs.On Wednesday morning, a counsel had mentioned before the CJI that the Aug 11 order was in conflict with last year's SC judgment, which had ordered civic bodies to act with compassion and strictly inaccordance with the Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules, 2023, while dealing with stray dogs.Another counsel appeared before the CJI at 4 pm and complained that while the Aug 11 order was not yet available, authorities had begun implementing it.Also Read: 'Delhi people are fed up of stray dogs': What CM Rekha Gupta said on Supreme Court order; says 'we want to provide relief'In their 2024 judgment, the bench of Justices Maheshwari and Karol had said, "Under all circumstances, there cannot be any indiscriminate killings of canines, and authorities have to take action in terms of the mandate and spirit of the prevalent legislation(s) in place. There is no gainsaying the fact that exhibiting compassion to all living beings is the enshrined constitutional value and mandate and casts obligation on the authorities to maintain it."The Aug 11 order is also not in harmony with the Animal Birth Control rules which prohibit relocation of stray dogs.End of ArticleFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   PreviousJanmashtami 2025: Manasi Parekh’s Festive LooksEntertainmentPavitra Punia’s Accessories Speak Louder Than WordstvJyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunningEntertainmentGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalEntertainmentRajinikanth’s style and makeover over the yearsEntertainmentSuperstar turns golden: 50 years of Rajinikanth in picturesEntertainmentFrom Sridevi to Deepika Padukone: Bollywood actresses who worked with RajinikanthEntertainmentIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiLifestyleAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameEntertainmentLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietLifestyle Next123 Photostories  Why is the Peepal tree worshipped in India5 early symptoms of Diabetes in men that should not be ignoredCardiologist says these blood tests that can predict heart disease risks even before symptoms appearTemples, Taj, and Thar: An epic 15-day adventure in the heart of North IndiaThis is how cooking meat may increase the risk of cancerFrom bullied schoolboy to ₹3,000 crore superstar – Hrithik Roshan’s inspiring journeyHow to see incredible India in just two weeksSeeds that supercharge muscle growth and overall healthFrom Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leavesTop 5 Getaways in North and South India to Work Remotely123Hot PicksAsim MunirJapan Nikkei 225Nayara EnergyUS tariffs impactDonald Trump tariffsFord Electric Pickup TruckNew Income Tax Bill 2025Top TrendingTyreek HillVanessa BryantDwyane WadeKyrie lrvingNHL Trade RumorsShannon SharpeCaitlin ClarkAndy ReidShedeur SandersBrock LesnarTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteHouse panel flags concerns over quality of data for assessing JJM’s performance'Tragic chapter': PM Modi, Amit Shah pay tribute to victims on Partition Horrors Remembrance Day; honour their gritBLA labelled foreign terrorist org as Trump plans to develop Pakistan's 'huge oil reserves'Rajasthan high court order disappointing, but won't lose cool this time: Supreme Court's Pardiwala benchWhen and how to conduct SIR is Election Commission's exclusive domain: Supreme CourtConsider converting Noida to a metropolitan council: Supreme Court to UP govtAll cinemas must screen 1 Bengali film per day: Mamata BanerjeeAdoption law frustrating, needs to be simplified: Supreme CourtDragon-Elephant Tango?
