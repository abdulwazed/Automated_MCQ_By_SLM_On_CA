He discusses the accidental creation of Samba and emphasizes Gabbar's asexuality as a key element of his powerful villain persona. Akhtar also shares insights into the film's initial poor reception and Salim-Javed's unwavering confidence in its success.  As 'Sholay' turns 50 tomorrow (August 15th), its legacy remains as unshakable as the rocky cliffs of Ramgarh. Few films in Indian cinema have transcended generations the way Ramesh Sippy’s magnum opus has — its dialogues, characters, and even silences etched into popular culture. But behind the spectacle lies a creation born from instinct, conviction, and an unflinching belief in its own storytelling. In this candid conversation with ETimes, Javed Akhtar — one half of the legendary Salim-Javed duo — revisits the genesis of the film, reveals the lesser-known transformations of its characters, and shares why neither he nor Salim ever doubted Sholay, even when the world thought it had failed.Javed Saab, you must be so fed up of talking about 'Sholay'?I’ve said it all over and over again. Obviously, I can’t change the narrative just to make it interesting every time. Jo tha, woh tha. That’s it.The making of Thakur’s characterLet’s begin with the character of Thakur.To begin with, Thakur was not a Thakur at all, but a retired army officer who had lost his hands in action. Jai and Veeru were initially two undisciplined recruits thrown out of the army. He chased them and asked for their help.But then Salim and I thought that if you portray army characters, you must maintain a certain dignity and discipline, and there would be restrictions. Showing undisciplined recruits was also not a good idea. So, we made Thakur a police officer and turned Jai and Veeru into petty criminals. That’s how it started.So originally, Sanjeev Kumar’s character had lost his hands as an army officer?Yes. A hand grenade exploded. But that idea was dropped, and we brought the character into the police force. Jai and Veeru became petty criminals who, despite being in police custody, once saved Thakur’s life. He was the man who had arrested them, but this act formed a good impression, and he later called them for help.How other characters came inWhen we began developing the screenplay, other characters entered — Basanti, Radha, Imam Sahab, Ramlal (played by Satyen Kappu, who worked for Thakur), and many others. Interestingly, at the screenplay stage, there was no Samba.The birth of SambaReally? How did Samba happen?When I was writing Gabbar’s introduction scene, Samba was born. Important people often have sycophants who talk about their achievements. Gabbar had to boast about the ₹50,000 reward for his arrest — a huge sum back then — but he wouldn’t say it himself; it was beneath his dignity. So, we gave him a yes-man.Once we did that, we realised it was a good gimmick. The idea was that whenever Gabbar was in thought, he would call Samba and ask something. But Samba actually answers only once — about the ₹50,000 reward. Later, when Gabbar asks, “Ramgarh ke log apni ladkiyon ko kaun se chakki ka aata khilate hain?” Samba has no reply. In the entire film, Samba speaks just one line.On Gabbar’s asexualityGabbar is terrifying, but also completely asexual. Even when he ties up the girl, he sneers but never leers. Gabbar, Mogambo, or even Shakal from Shaan — they are all totally asexual. They are never interested in women. If a powerful villain starts lusting after a woman, he looks like a beggar.How a beggar?It’s below a powerful villain’s dignity to go after anything. Lust is not power; it makes you look like a lecher, and lechery isn’t dignified.In Shaan, Shakal kidnaps Raakhee Gulzar’s character and tells her she’ll be held until her husband comes to save her. She’s tense, thinking he might keep her for the night. He smiles and says, “Don’t flatter yourself. I am not interested in you at all. You don’t attract me.”Why Shakal didn’t work like GabbarWhy do you think Shakal didn’t click like Gabbar? Was he too urban? Too James Bond?No, it wasn’t Shakal. It was the film that didn’t work. It wasn’t made from the heart. There was an anxiety to perform — performance anxiety — and that killed it. Otherwise, the characters and performances were very good.RD Burman’s music — Shaan vs SholayIn my opinion, RD Burman’s music was better in Shaan than in Sholay, except for the background score.I don’t think Sholay’s songs were very good. 'Mehbooba O Mehbooba' and 'Yeh Dosti' were hits, but they were situational. In fact, the EPs and LPs of the dialogues sold much more than the songs. The first EP was titled Viru Ki Shaadi. The verbal sold far more than the musical.RD really excelled in the background music, not the songs. Maybe when he saw the complete film, he realised the songs were comparatively weaker, so he compensated in the background score — and he did that with vengeance.When 'Sholay' opened poorlyWhen the film released, the team was anxious because it wasn’t doing well. You even planned to change the ending?Not us. Not Salim-Javed. Not for a second did we think the film would go wrong. Others got nervous, but our confidence never wavered. In the first week itself, on Friday, we gave an ad in Screen, Film Information and Trade Guide that Salim-Javed guarantee Sholay will do more than ₹1 crore. We put our money where our mouth was — when the industry was convinced it had failed.The team had an emergency meeting at Amitabh Bachchan’s home?No. He was neither that important nor powerful then for us to go to his house for such a meeting. It happened at my place. Bachchan Saab, GP Sippy, and Ramesh Sippy came over, and the five of us discussed the situation. We told them, “Don’t worry. Nothing will happen to you.” Not for a second did we think the picture could fail. We gave ads, and the rest is history.About the AuthorTOI Entertainment DeskThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
