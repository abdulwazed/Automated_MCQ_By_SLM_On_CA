Ivanka Trump with her father, Donald Trump (Instagram: ivankatrump)  President Donald Trump reportedly wants his daughter, Ivanka Trump, to participate in planning and organizing an Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) cage fight on the White House lawn to commemorate America’s 250th Independence anniversary next year. This comes despite her having stepped back from politics.Since Trump’s reelection for a second term last November, Ivanka has largely stayed out of the public spotlight. However, UFC CEO Dana White said the president wants her involved in the plans for the White House event.“When [Trump] called me and asked me to do it, he said, ‘I want Ivanka in the middle of this,’” White told CBS Mornings. “So Ivanka reached out to me, and her and I started talking about the possibilities, where it would be and, you know, I put together all the renderings.”Ivanka has attended multiple UFC events with her father, as reported by the Independent.White’s relationship with Trump dates back to the early 2000s, when the president hosted some of the first UFC events at his properties. White confirmed that discussions with Trump took place Monday night, and the fight is scheduled for July 4, 2026.Trump, who has attended several UFC events, said the occasion would be one of many celebrations marking the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.Ivanka’s potential involvement would mark her return to public events after a three-year break, during which she has focused on her children and husband, Jared Kushner. In 2022, she stated, “I love my father very much. This time around, I am choosing to prioritize my young children and the private life we are creating as a family. I do not plan to be involved in politics.”Both Ivanka and Kushner played central roles in Trump’s 2016 campaign and served as presidential advisors beginning in 2017. Following the contentious 2020 election and the Capitol Hill riots, Ivanka chose not to participate in her father’s second presidential run.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
