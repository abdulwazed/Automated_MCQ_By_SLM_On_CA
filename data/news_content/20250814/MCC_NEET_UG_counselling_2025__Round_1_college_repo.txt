Students who were not allotted a seat in Round 1 still have the opportunity to participate in Round 2 counselling. The MCC has provided detailed instructions regarding eligibility, registration, and seat allotment for the next round. Candidates are advised to check mcc.nic.in regularly for official updates.Seat allotment and reporting detailsRound 1 seat allotment results for NEET UG 2025 have been released on the MCC official website.
