Okay, picture this: you’re chopping coriander for your tadka, and your mum or dadi casually says, “Put some on your hair, it’s good for growth.” You roll your eyes because… how can pudina’s less glamorous cousin make your hair grow? Well, turns out, she was right all along.Yes, the same humble bunch of dhaniya you use for chutneys is basically a growth serum in disguise. Cheap, easy, natural and no, it won’t make your head smell like sambar.Why dhaniya deserves a spot in your hair routineLet’s give credit where it’s due. Dhaniya leaves are like a little green powerhouse. They’re loaded with Vitamin C, Vitamin K, iron, and antioxidants. Translation: they feed your hair follicles, improve blood flow to the scalp, and keep hair from falling out like autumn leaves.Plus, it’s one of those “kitchen to beauty shelf” hacks that’s been passed down generations. No chemicals, no fancy packaging, just pure, old-school magic.The easiest way to make dhaniya waterAlright, here’s the lazy-girl recipe.You will need:1 cup fresh coriander leaves (don’t be stingy, more leaves = more power)2–3 cups waterOptional: a few drops of coconut or castor oil if you want some extra oomphMethod:Wash the leaves properly because no one wants scalp dirt.Roughly chop them and throw them in a blender with 1 cup of water.Blend into a green paste - yes, it will look like chutney.Strain it with a fine sieve or cloth.Add the remaining water to dilute it.Boom. Your hair tonic is ready. Bonus points if you pour it into a spray bottle because it makes you feel like a fancy influencer.How to use it without making a messIf you think you can just pour it over your head and be done - nope. There’s a little art to it.Start clean - Shampoo first so your scalp is free from oil and gunk.Section your hair - Otherwise, you’ll miss half your scalp.Massage like you mean it - Pour/spray the dhaniya water and give yourself a nice scalp massage for 5–7 minutes. Feels heavenly.Wrap it up - Cover with a shower cap and chill for 30–45 minutes. Perfect time for scrolling Insta or stalking your ex’s new haircut.Rinse off - Use water or a mild shampoo to wash it out. If you added oil, shampoo twice.How often to use itTwo times a week is your sweet spot. Stick with it for a month and you’ll see less hair in your comb. Two to three months in, you might spot those cute baby hairs growing along your hairline.Remember, natural stuff takes time, this isn’t a “Rapunzel in 7 days” situation.Want to amp it up?Mix dhaniya water with:Aloe vera gel for extra moistureFenugreek water for dandruff dramaLemon juice if your scalp gets oily fastYou can even mix the coriander paste directly into coconut oil, massage it in, and leave it overnight if you want to go full TLC mode.Little things to keep in mindAlways do a patch test. Rare, but some people can react to coriander.Use fresh leaves, not dried coriander powder (your scalp is not a curry).Be consistent. Missing weeks will just take you back to square one.Why it’s totally worth the effortHonestly? In a world of hair products that cost more than rent, it feels good to go old-school. Dhaniya water not only helps with growth, it makes your hair shinier, softer, and stronger.Plus, there’s this smug joy when someone says, “Your hair looks amazing” and you go, “Oh thanks, it’s just coriander water.” Watch their face. Priceless.Next time you grab a bunch of dhaniya from the sabziwala, keep some aside for your hair. It’s budget-friendly, low-effort, and actually works. And who knows - in a few months, you might just have the thick, swishy hair you keep saving on Pinterest.About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.
