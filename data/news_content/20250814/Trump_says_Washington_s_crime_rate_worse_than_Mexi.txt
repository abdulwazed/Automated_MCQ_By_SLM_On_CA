He announced federal control over the Metropolitan Police Department, deploying the National Guard to restore order. Trump vowed to liberate the city from thugs and killers, aiming to make it safe, clean, habitable, and beautiful once more. Donald Trump (AP file photo) US president Donald Trump on Wednesday said that Washington’s crime rate was among the highest in the world. He claimed DC’s homicide rate was worse than in cities like Mexico City, Bogota, Islamabad and Addis Ababa, and almost ten times higher than Fallujah in Iraq. Posting on Truth Social, the US president wrote, “If DC were a state, it would have the highest homicide rate of any state in America. The violent crime rate in DC has worsened, and the murder rate has essentially doubled in just over a decade. He also alleged manipulation of crime data. "But these are only the ‘official’ statistics released by corrupt city officials. The real numbers are many times worse. In fact, a precinct commander was just suspended for allegedly manipulating the violent crime statistics, and the DC police union likewise says the real numbers are much higher,” Trump wrote.. He further alleged that the Democrat government of DC had “largely stopped investigating, arresting and prosecuting most crime,” adding that no one was arrested for shoplifting. Trump said DC residents were living in fear and had largely given up on calling the police, instead avoiding the streets after dark. He added, “DC has been under siege from thugs and killers, but now DC is back under federal control where it belongs. The White House is in charge. The military and our great police will liberate this city, scrape away the filth, and make it safe, clean, habitable and beautiful once more!” Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Trump announced that the Metropolitan Police Department would now be under federal authority, with the National Guard deployed to restore order. He said the aim was to make the capital “safe, clean, habitable and beautiful” again.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.
