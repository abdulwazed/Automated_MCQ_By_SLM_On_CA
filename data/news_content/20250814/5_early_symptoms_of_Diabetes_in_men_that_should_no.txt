The body experiences this condition when it either fails to produce adequate insulin, or loses its ability to use insulin effectively. (Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps regulate blood sugar levels by allowing glucose to enter cells for energy) In most cases, Diabetes is usually not reversible, but it can be managed with a healthy diet, and medication. Both men and women can get Diabetes at any point in their lives, but the symptoms might be slightly different. Here are some early signs of Diabetes in men (however, these are not exclusive to the condition, and only a blood test can confirm the same)2/613/6234/6Erectile dysfunction and low testosteroneDiabetes creates specific sexual health complications which affect men. Erectile dysfunction is a typical symptom, which causes difficulties with achieving or sustaining an erection. The onset of erectile dysfunction occurs earlier in diabetic men compared to non-diabetic men. The condition develops because elevated blood sugar levels injure nerves along with blood vessels, which maintain normal sexual operations. Men who have diabetes face an elevated probability of developing low testosterone, which healthcare providers refer to as low-T. Decreased sex drive together with depression symptoms and muscle strength reduction are possible consequences of low testosterone levels in men. Retrograde ejaculation represents another possible condition, where semen enters the bladder instead of passing through the penis during ejaculation. These health issues stem from diabetes effects on hormone levels and nerve system health in men.5/6Slow-healing wounds and frequent infectionsDiabetes causes the immune system to slow down, thus making wounds and cuts heal at a slower rate. Men who have diabetes notice that their small cuts, infections and scrapes, require longer periods to heal than normal. The risk of developing serious or infected wounds becomes higher because of these factors. The symptoms of repeated infections include both urinary tract infections and fungal infections, that present as genital thrush. Yeast infections of private areas is also common, because the high sugar content in urine creates an ideal environment for yeast to multiply. The affected areas typically show redness alongside swelling and itchiness, along with white lumps on the skin surface.6/6Blurred vision and numbnessVision changes constitute a common symptom which diabetic men typically experience. Men with diabetes often experience fluid movement in their eyes, that distorts their lenses, thus producing blurry vision. The condition of diabetic retinopathy develops from blurred vision through extended exposure to high blood sugar levels. This also produces numbness, along with tingling sensations in the feet and hands of diabetic men. The body develops nerve damage from prolonged exposure to high blood sugar levels. The initial mild sensations from these symptoms can transform into severe discomfort before causing complete numbness. The symptoms of blurred vision and numbness indicate diabetes-related nerve and organ damage, which requires prompt medical care for proper management and prevention of additional damage.Sources:https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_symptoms_in_men/article.htmhttps://www.lybrate.com/topic/diabeteshttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/311173https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/understanding-diabetes-symptomshttps://www.nhs.uk/conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms/https://www.healthline.com/health/diabeteshttps://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/signs-symptoms/index.htmlDisclaimer: This article is informational only and not a substitute for medical adviceFollow Us On Social Media Visual Stories   Previous9 gut-friendly drinks for the changing seasonFood​Jyotika style moments that prove simplicity can be stunning​indiaCelebrating 79th Independence Day: 10 slogans that inspired India’s freedom movement​indiaGorgeous pictures of Sonia AggarwalindiaIndependence Day 2025: 10 Indian garments which are truly swadeshiindiaAishwarya Lekshmi – Where grace meets sunshine in every frameindiaLithium deficiency may trigger early dementia: 8 lithium-rich foods to add to the dietindiaBirthday Special: Spine-chilling quotes of Alfred Hitchcock that will keep you up at nightindia10 baby names that mean creativity and visionindia Next123 Photostories  Cardiologist says these blood tests that can predict heart disease risks even before symptoms appearSachin Tendulkar’s son Arjun Tendulkar gets engaged to Saaniya Chandok: All about the couple’s family background and educational qualificationsTemples, Taj, and Thar: An epic 15-day adventure in the heart of North IndiaFrom bullied schoolboy to ₹3,000 crore superstar – Hrithik Roshan’s inspiring journeyThis is how cooking meat may increase the risk of cancerHow to see incredible India in just two weeksSeeds that supercharge muscle growth and overall healthNAFLD in kids: Harvard-trained doctor explains why this silent liver disease is on the riseFrom Laddoo to Paratha: 5 nutritious recipes made with moringa leaves123lifestyle videos13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement13:05Life After 60: How To Redefine Life Post-Retirement16:34Life After 60: Why India's seniors are choosing community living04:34Control Your Senses, Gain Knowledge, Attain Peace: Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4.3906:37Cultural Clashes in Love: How To Make Your Relationship Work03:19Prayagraj MahaKumbh 2025 Readies For Millions: Massive Preparations Underway In Uttar Pradesh04:48Sadhguru Reveals The Truth About Black Magic And Your Photograph07:18BK Shivani On Forgiveness: Why It’s Essential For Inner Peace08:08How Bhairavi Sadhana Accelerates Your Path to Liberation: Sadhguru Speaks06:47Breakup Recovery: How To Not Wallow In Misery And Love Yourself03:20The Purifying Power of Yajna: Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4, Verse 3011:41How Dattatreya Accepted Parashuram as His Disciple – Sadhguru Reveals03:54Can Water Remember?
